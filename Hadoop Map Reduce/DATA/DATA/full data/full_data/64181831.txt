64181831	john leechs pictures of life and character   by william makepeace thackeray     reprinted from the quarterly review no 191 dec 1854 by permission of mr john murray    we who can recall the consulship of plancus and quite respectable oldfogyfied times remember amongst other amusements which we had as children the pictures at which we were permitted to look there was boydells shakspeare black and ghastly gallery of murky opies glum northcotes straddling fuselis there were lear oberon hamlet with starting muscles rolling eyeballs and long pointing quivering fingers there was little prince arthur northcote crying in white satin and bidding good hubert not put out his eyes there was hubert crying there was little rutland being run through the poor little body by bloody clifford there was cardinal beaufort reynolds gnashing his teeth and grinning and howling demoniacally on his deathbed a picture frightful to the present day there was lady hamilton romney waving a torch and dancing before a black backgrounda melancholy museum indeed smirkes delightful seven ages only fitfully relieved its general gloom we did not like to inspect it unless the elders were present and plenty of lights and company were in the room  cheerful relatives used to treat us to miss linwoods let the children of the present generation thank their stars that tragedy is put out of their way miss linwoods was worstedwork your grandmother or grandaunts took you there and said the pictures were admirable you saw the woodman in worsted with his axe and dog trampling through the snow the snow bitter cold to look at the woodmans pipe wonderful a gloomy piece that made you shudder there were large dingy pictures of woollen martyrs and scowling warriors with limbs strongly knitted there was especially at the end of a black passage a den of lions that would frighten any boy not born in africa or exeter change and accustomed to them  another exhibition used to be wests gallery where the pleasing figures of lazarus in his graveclothes and death on the pale horse used to impress us children the tombs of westminster abbey the vaults at st pauls the men in armor at the tower frowning ferociously out of their helmets and wielding their dreadful swords that superhuman queen elizabeth at the end of the room a livid sovereign with glass eyes a ruff and a dirty satin petticoat riding a horse covered with steel who does not remember these sights in london in the consulship of plancus and the waxwork in fleet street not like that of madame tussauds whose chamber of death is gay and brilliant but a nice old gloomy waxwork full of murderers and as a chief attraction the dead baby and the princess charlotte lying in state  our storybooks had no pictures in them for the most part frank dear old frank had none nor the parents assistant nor the evenings at home nor our copy of the ami des enfans there were a few just at the end of the spellingbook besides the allegory at the beginning of education leading up youth to the temple of industry where dr dilworth and professor walkinghame stood with crowns of laurel there were we say just a few pictures at the end of the spellingbook little oval gray woodcuts of bewicks mostly of the wolf and the lamb the dog and the shadow and brown jones and robinson with long ringlets and little tights but for pictures so to speak what had we the rough old woodblocks in the old harlequinbacked fairybooks had served hundreds of years before our plancus in the time of priscus plancusin queen annes time who knows we were flogged at school we were fifty boys in our boardinghouse and had to wash in a leaden trough under a cistern with lumps of fat yellow soap floating about in the ice and water are our sons ever flogged have they not dressingrooms hairoil hipbaths and baden towels and what picturebooks the young villains have what have these children done that they should be so much happier than we were  we had the arabian nights and walter scott to be sure smirkes illustrations to the former are very fine we did not know how good they were then but we doubt whether we did not prefer the little old miniature library nights with frontispieces by uwins for these books the pictures dont count every boy of imagination does his own pictures to scott and the arabian nights best  of funny pictures there were none especially intended for us children there was rowlandsons doctor syntax doctor syntax in a fuzzwig on a horse with legs like sausages riding races making love frolicking with rosy exuberant damsels those pictures were very funny and that aquatinting and the gaycolored plates very pleasant to witness but if we could not read the poem in those days could we digest it in this nevertheless apart from the text which we could not master we remember doctor syntax pleasantly like those cheerful painted hieroglyphics in the nineveh court at sydenham what matter for the arrowhead illegible stuff give us the placid grinning kings twanging their jolly bows over their rident horses wounding those goodhumored enemies who tumble gayly off the towers or drown smiling in the dimpling waters amidst the anerithmon gelasma of the fish  after doctor syntax the apparition of corinthian tom jerry hawthorn and the facetious bob logic must be recordeda wondrous history indeed theirs was when the future student of our manners comes to look over the pictures and the writing of these queer volumes what will he think of our society customs and language in the consulship of plancus corinthian it appears was the phrase applied to men of fashion and ton in plancuss time they were the brilliant predecessors of the swell of the present periodbrilliant but somewhat barbarous it must be confessed the corinthians were in the habit of drinking a great deal too much in tom cribbs parlor they used to go and see life in the ginshops of nights walking home as well as they could they used to knock down charleys poor harmless old watchmen with lanterns guardians of the streets of rome planco consule they perpetrated a vast deal of boxing they put on the mufflers in jacksons rooms they sported their prads in the ring in the park they attended cockfights and were enlightened patrons of dogs and destroyers of rats besides these sports the delassemens of gentlemen mixing with the people our patricians of course occasionally enjoyed the society of their own class what a wonderful picture that used to be of corinthian tom dancing with corinthian kate at almacks what a prodigious dress kate wore with what graceful abandon the pair flung their arms about as they swept through the mazy quadrille with all the noblemen standing round in their stars and uniforms you may still doubtless see the pictures at the british museum or find the volumes in the corner of some old countryhouse library you are led to suppose that the english aristocracy of 1820 did dance and caper in that way and box and drink at tom cribbs and knock down watchmen and the children of today turning to their elders may say grandmamma did you wear such a dress as that when you danced at almacks there was very little of it grandmamma did grandpapa kill many watchmen when he was a young man and frequent thieves ginshops cockfights and the ring before you married him did he use to talk the extraordinary slang and jargon which is printed in this book he is very much changed he seems a gentlemanly old boy enough now  in the abovenamed consulate when we had grandfathers alive there would be in the old gentlemans library in the country two or three old mottled portfolios or great swollen scrapbooks of blue paper full of the comic prints of grandpapas time ere plancus ever had the fasces borne before him these prints were signed gilray bunbury rowlandson woodward and some actually george cruikshankfor george is a veteran now and he took the etching needle in hand as a child he caricatured boney borrowing not a little from gilray in his first puerile efforts he drew louis xviii trying on boneys boots before the century was actually in its teens we believe that george cruikshank was amusing the public  in those great colored prints in our grandfathers portfolios in the library and in some other apartments of the house where the caricatures used to be pasted in those days we found things quite beyond our comprehension boney was represented as a fierce dwarf with goggle eyes a huge laced hat and tricolored plume a crooked sabre reeking with blood a little demon revelling in lust murder massacre john bull was shown kicking him a good deal indeed he was prodigiously kicked all through that series of pictures by sidney smith and our brave allies the gallant turks by the excellent and patriotic spaniards by the amiable and indignant russiansall nations had boots at the service of poor master boney how pitt used to defy him how good old george king of brobdingnag laughed at gulliverboney sailing about in his tank to make sport for their majesties this little fiend this beggars brat cowardly murderous and atheistic as he was we remember in those old portfolios pictures representing boney and his family in rags gnawing raw bones in a corsican hut boney murdering the sick at jaffa boney with a hookah and a large turban having adopted the turkish religion cthis corsican monster nevertheless had some devoted friends in england according to the gilray chroniclea set of villains who loved atheism tyranny plunder and wickedness in general like their french friend in the pictures these men were all represented as dwarfs like their ally the miscreants got into power at one time and if we remember right were called the broadbacked administration one with shaggy eyebrows and a bristly beard the hirsute ringleader of the rascals was it appears called charles james fox another miscreant with a blotched countenance was a certain sheridan other imps were hight erskine norfolk jockey of moira henry petty as in our childish innocence we used to look at these demons now sprawling and tipsy in their cups now scaling heaven from which the angelic pitt hurled them down now cursing the light their atrocious ringleader fox was represented with hairy cloven feet and a tail and horns now kissing boneys boot but inevitably discomfited by pitt and the other good angels we hated these vicious wretches as good children should we were on the side of virtue and pitt and grandpapa but if our sisters wanted to look at the portfolios the good old grandfather used to hesitate there were some prints among them very odd indeed some that girls could not understand some that boys indeed had best not see we swiftly turn over those prohibited pages how many of them there were in the wild coarse reckless ribald generous book of old english humor  how savage the satire washow fierce the assaultwhat garbage hurled at opponentswhat foul blows were hitwhat language of billingsgate flung fancy a party in a countryhouse now looking over woodwards facetiae or some of the gilray comicalities or the slatternly saturnalia of rowlandson whilst we live we must laugh and have folks to make us laugh we cannot afford to lose satyr with his pipe and dances and gambols but we have washed combed clothed and taught the rogue good manners or rather let us say he has learned them himself for he is of nature soft and kindly and he has put aside his mad pranks and tipsy habits and frolicsome always has become gentle and harmless smitten into shame by he pure presence of our women and the sweet confiding smiles of our children among the veterans the old pictorial satirists we have mentioned the famous name of one humorous designer who is still alive and at work did we not see by his own hand his own portrait of his own famous face and whiskers in the illustrated london news the other day there was a print in that paper of an assemblage of teetotalers in sadlers wells theatre and we straightway recognized the old roman handthe old romans of the time of plancusgeorge cruikshanks there were the old bonnets and droll faces and shoes and short trousers and figures of 1820 sure enough and there was george who has taken to the waterdoctrine as all the world knows handing some teetotal cresses over a plank to the table where the pledge was being administered how often has george drawn that picture of cruikshank where havent we seen it how fine it was facing the effigy of mr ainsworth in ainsworths magazine when george illustrated that periodical how grand and severe he stands in that design in g cs omnibus where he represents himself tonged like st dunstan and tweaking a wretch of a publisher by the nose the collectors of georges etchingsoh the charming etchingsoh the dear old german popular talesthe capital points of humorthe delightful phrenology and scrapbooks of the good time our timeplancuss in factthe collectors of the georgian etchings we say have at least a hundred pictures of the artist why we remember him in his favorite hessian boots in tom and jerry itself and in woodcuts as far back as the queens trial he has rather deserted satire and comedy of late years having turned his attention to the serious and warlike and sublime having confessed our age and prejudices we prefer the comic and fanciful to the historic romantic and at present didactic george may respect and length of days and comfortable repose attend the brave honest kindly pureminded artist humorist moralist it was he first who brought english pictorial humor and children acquainted our young people and their fathers and mothers owe him many a pleasant hour and harmless laugh is there no way in which the country could acknowledge the long services and brave career of such a friend and benefactor  since georges time humor has been converted comus and his wicked satyrs and leering fauns have disappeared and fled into the lowest haunts and comuss lady if she had a taste for humor which may be doubted might take up our funny picturebooks without the slightest precautionary squeamishness what can be purer than the charming fancies of richard doyle in all mr punchs huge galleries cant we walk as safely as through miss pinkertons schoolrooms and as we look at mr punchs pictures at the illustrated news pictures at all the pictures in the bookshop windows at this christmas season as oldsters we feel a certain pang of envy against the youngstersthey are too well off why hadnt we picturebooks why were we flogged so a plague on the lictors and their rods in the time of plancus  and now after this rambling preface we are arrived at the subject in handmr john leech and his pictures of life and character in the collection of mr punch this book is better than plumcake at christmas it is an enduring plumcake which you may eat and which you may slice and deliver to your friends and to which having cut it you may come again and welcome from years end to years end in the frontispiece you see mr punch examining the pictures in his gallerya portly welldressed middleaged respectable gentleman in a white neckcloth and a polite evening costumesmiling in a very bland and agreeable manner upon one of his pleasant drawings taken out of one of his handsome portfolios mr punch has very good reason to smile at the work and be satisfied with the artist mr leech his chief contributor and some kindred humorists with pencil and pen have served mr punch admirably time was if we remember mr ps history rightly that he did not wear silk stockings nor wellmade clothes the little dorsal irregularity in his figure is almost an ornament now so excellent a tailor has he he was of humble beginnings it is said he kept a ragged little booth which he put up at corners of streets associated with beadles policemen his own ugly wife whom he treated most scandalously and persons in a low station of life earning a precarious livelihood by the cracking of wild jokes the singing of ribald songs and halfpence extorted from passersby he is the satyric genius we spoke of anon he cracks his jokes still for satire must live but he is combed washed neatly clothed and perfectly presentable he goes into the very best company he keeps a stud at melton he has a moor in scotland he rides in the park has his stall at the opera is constantly dining out at clubs and in private society and goes every night in the season to balls and parties where you see the most beautiful women possible he is welcomed amongst his new friends the great though like the good old english gentleman of the song he does not forget the small he pats the heads of street boys and girls relishes the jokes of jack the costermonger and bob the dustman goodnaturedly spies out molly the cook flirting with policeman x or mary the nursemaid as she listens to the fascinating guardsman he used rather to laugh at guardsmen plungers and other military men and was until latter days very contemptuous in his behavior towards frenchmen he has a natural antipathy to pomp and swagger and fierce demeanor but now that the guardsmen are gone to war and the dandies of the ragdandies no moreare battling like heroes at balaklava and inkermann by the side of their heroic allies mr punchs laughter is changed to hearty respect and enthusiasm it is not against courage and honor he wars but this great moralistmust it be ownedhas some popular british prejudices and these led him in peace time to laugh at soldiers and frenchmen if those hulking footmen who accompanied the carriages to the opening of parliament the other day would form a plush brigade wear only gunpowder in their hair and strike with their great canes on the enemy mr punch would leave off laughing at jeames who meanwhile remains among us to all outward appearance regardless of satire and calmly consuming his five meals per diem against lawyers beadles bishops and clergy and authorities mr punch is still rather bitter at the time of the papal aggression he was prodigiously angry and one of the chief misfortunes which happened to him at that period was that through the violent opinions which he expressed regarding the roman catholic hierarchy he lost the invaluable services the graceful pencil the harmless wit the charming fancy of mr doyle another member of mr punchs cabinet the biographer of jeames the author of the snob papers resigned his functions on account of mr punchs assaults upon the present emperor of the french nation whose anger jeames thought it was unpatriotic to arouse mr punch parted with these contributors he filled their places with others as good the boys at the railroad stations cried punch just as cheerily and sold just as many numbers after these events as before        this was written in 1854  there is no blinking the fact that in mr punchs cabinet john leech is the righthand man fancy a number of punch without leechs pictures what would you give for it the learned gentlemen who write the work must feel that without him it were as well left alone look at the rivals whom the popularity of punch has brought into the field the direct imitators of mr leechs mannerthe artists with a manner of their ownhow inferior their pencils are to his in humor in depicting the public manners in arresting amusing the nation the truth the strength the free vigor the kind humor the john bull pluck and spirit of that hand are approached by no competitor with what dexterity he draws a horse a woman a child he feels them all so to speak like a man what plump young beauties those are with which mr punchs chief contributor supplies the old gentlemans pictorial harem what famous thews and sinews mr punchs horses have and how briggs on the back of them scampers across country you see youth strength enjoyment manliness in those drawings and in none more so to our thinking than in the hundred pictures of children which this artist loves to design like a brave hearty goodnatured briton he becomes quite soft and tender with the little creatures pats gently their little golden heads and watches with unfailing pleasure their ways their sports their jokes laughter caresses enfans terribles come home from eton young miss practising her first flirtation poor little ragged polly making dirtpies in the gutter or staggering under the weight of jacky her nursechild who is as big as herselfall these little ones patrician and plebeian meet with kindness from this kind heart and are watched with curious nicety by this amiable observer  we remember in one of those ancient gilray portfolios a print which used to cause a sort of terror in us youthful spectators and in which the prince of wales his royal highness was a foxite then was represented as sitting alone in a magnificent hall after a voluptuous meal and using a great steel fork in the guise of a toothpick fancy the first young gentleman living employing such a weapon in such a way the most elegant prince of europe engaged with a twopronged iron forkthe heir of britannia with a bident the man of genius who drew that picture saw little of the society which he satirized and amused gilray watched public characters as they walked by the shop in st jamess street or passed through the lobby of the house of commons his studio was a garret or little better his place of amusement a tavernparlor where his club held its nightly sittings over their pipes and sanded floor you could not have society represented by men to whom it was not familiar when gavarni came to england a few years sinceone of the wittiest of men one of the most brilliant and dexterous of draughtsmenhe published a book of les anglais and his anglais were all frenchmen the eye so keen and so long practised to observe parisian life could not perceive english character a social painter must be of the world which he depicts and native to the manners which he portrays  now any one who looks over mr leechs portfolio must see that the social pictures which he gives us are authentic what comfortable little drawingrooms and diningrooms what snug libraries we enter what fine younggentlemanly wags they are those beautiful little dandies who wake up gouty old grandpapa to ring the bell who decline aunts pudding and custards saying that they will reserve themselves for an anchovy toast with the claret who talk together in ballroom doors where fred whispers charleypointing to a dear little partner seven years oldmy dear charley she has very much gone off you should have seen that girl last season look well at everything appertaining to the economy of the famous mr briggs how snug quiet appropriate all the appointments are what a comfortable neat clean middleclass house briggss is in the bayswater suburb of london we should guess from the sketches of the surrounding scenery what a good stable he has with a loose box for those celebrated hunters which he rides how pleasant clean and warm his breakfasttable looks what a trim little maid brings in the topboots which horrify mrs b what a snug dressingroom he has complete in all its appointments and in which he appears trying on the delightful huntingcap which mrs briggs flings into the fire how cosy all the briggs party seem in their diningroom briggs reading a treatise on dogbreaking by a lamp mamma and grannie with their respective needleworks the children clustering round a great book of printsa great book of prints such as this before us which at this season must make thousands of children happy by as many firesides the inner life of all these people is represented leech draws them as naturally as teniers depicts dutch boors or morland pigs and stables it is your house and mine we are looking at everybodys family circle our boys coming from school give themselves such airs the young scapegraces our girls going to parties are so tricked out by fond mammasa social history of london in the middle of the nineteenth century as such future studentslucky they to have a book so pleasantwill regard these pages even the mutations of fashion they may follow here if they be so inclined mr leech has as fine an eye for tailory and millinery as for horseflesh how they change those cloaks and bonnets how we have to pay milliners bills from year to year where are those prodigious chatelaines of 1850 which no lady could be without where those charming waistcoats those stunning waistcoats which our young girls used to wear a few brief seasons back and which cause gus in the sweet little sketch of la mode to ask ellen for her tailors address gus is a young warrior by this time very likely facing the enemy at inkerman and pretty ellen and that love of a sister of hers are married and happy let us hope superintending one of those delightful nursery scenes which our artist depicts with such tender humor fortunate artist indeed you see he must have been bred at a good public school that he has ridden many a good horse in his day paid no doubt out of his own purse for the originals of some of those lovely caps and bonnets and watched paternally the ways smiles frolics and slumbers of his favorite little people  as you look at the drawings secrets come out of themprivate jokes as it were imparted to you by the author for your special delectation how remarkably for instance has mr leech observed the hairdressers of the present age look at mr tongs whom that hideous old bald woman who ties on her bonnet at the glass informs that she has used the whole bottle of balm of california but her hair comes off yet you can see the bearsgrease not only on tongss head but on his hands which he is clapping clammily together remark him who is telling his client there is cholera in the hair and that lucky rogue whom the young lady bids to cut off a long thick piecefor somebody doubtless all these men are different and delightfully natural and absurd why should hairdressing be an absurd profession  the amateur will remark what an excellent part hands play in mr leechs pieces his admirable actors use them with perfect naturalness look at betty putting the urn down at cook laying her hands on the kitchen table whilst her policeman grumbles at the cold meat they are cooks and housemaids hands without mistake and not without a certain beauty too the bald old lady who is tying her bonnet at tongss has hands which you see are trembling watch the fingers of the two old harridans who are talking scandal for what long years past they have pointed out holes in their neighbors dresses and mud on their flounces heres a go ive lost my diamond ring as the dustman utters this pathetic cry and looks at his hand you burst out laughing these are among the little points of humor one could indicate hundreds of such as one turns over the pleasant pages  there is a little snob or gent whom we all of us know who wears little tufts on his little chin outrageous pins and pantaloons smokes cigars on tobacconists counters sucks his cane in the streets struts about with mrs snob and the baby mrs s an immense woman whom snob nevertheless bullies who is a favorite abomination of leech and pursued by that savage humorist into a thousand of his haunts there he is choosing waistcoats at the tailorssuch waistcoats yonder he is giving a shilling to the sweeper who calls him capting now he is offering a paletot to a huge giant who is going out in the rain they dont know their own pictures very likely if they did they would have a meeting and thirty or forty of them would be deputed to thrash mr leech one feels a pity for the poor little bucks in a minute or two when we close this discourse and walk the streets we shall see a dozen such  ere we shut the desk up just one word to point out to the unwary specially to note the backgrounds of landscapes in leechs drawingshomely drawings of moor and wood and seashore and london streetthe scenes of his little dramas they are as excellently true to nature as the actors themselves our respect for the genius and humor which invented both increases as we look and look again at the designs may we have more of them more pleasant christmas volumes over which we and our children can laugh together can we have too much of truth and fun and beauty and kindness
