j e millais pra in                           the national gallery      book v 18591868     chapter i the italian revolution 18591860       rarely if ever in the course of our history has there been such     a mixture of high considerations legislative military     commercial foreign and constitutional each for the most part     traversing the rest and all capable of exercising a vital     influence on public policy as in the long and complicated session     of 1860 the commercial treaty first struck the keynote of the     year and the most deeply marked and peculiar feature of the year     was the silent conflict between the motives and provisions of the     treaty on the one hand and the excitement and exasperation of     military sentiment on the other—gladstone1   this description extends in truth much beyond the session of a given year to the whole existence of the new cabinet and through a highly important period in mr gladstone’s career more than that it directly links our biographic story to a series of events that created kingdoms awoke nations and remade the map of europe the opening of this long and complex episode was the italian revolution writing to sir john acton in 1864 mr gladstone said to him of the budget of 1860 “when viewed as a whole it is one of the few cases in which my fortunes as an individual have been closely associated with matters of a public and even an historic interest” i will venture to recall in outline to the reader’s memory the ampler background of this striking epoch in mr gladstone’s public life the old principles of the european statesystem and the old principles that inspired the vast contentions of ages lingered but they seemed to have grown decrepit divine right of kings providential preeminence of dynasties balance of power sovereign independence of the papacy—these and the other accredited catchwords of history were giving place to the vague indefinable shifting but most potent and inspiring doctrine of nationality on no statesman of this time did that fiery doctrine with all its tributaries gain more commanding hold than on mr gladstone “of the various and important incidents” he writes in a memorandum dated braemar july 16 1892 “which associated me almost unawares with foreign affairs in greece 1850 in the neapolitan kingdom 1851 and in the balkan peninsula and the turkish empire 1853 i will only say that they all contributed to forward the action of those home causes more continuous in their operation which without in any way effacing my old sense of reverence for the past determined for me my place in the present and my direction towards the future”    i   m1 at the opening of the seventh decade of the century—ten years of such moment for our western world—the relations of the european states with one another had fallen into chaos the perilous distractions of 185962 were the prelude to conflicts that after strange and mighty events at sadowa venice rome sedan versailles came to their close in 1871 the first breach in the ramparts of european order set up by the kings after waterloo was the independence of greece in 1829 then followed the transformation of the power of the turk over roumanians and serbs from despotism to suzerainty in 1830 paris overthrew monarchy by divine right belgium cut herself asunder from the supremacy of the dutch then italians and poles strove hard but in vain to shake off the yoke of austria and of russia in 1848 revolts of race against alien dominion broke out afresh in italy and hungary the rise of the french empire bringing with it the principle or idiosyncrasy of its new ruler carried this movement of race into its full ascendant treaties were confronted by the doctrine of nationality what called itself order quaked before something that for lack of a better name was called the revolution reason of state was eclipsed by the rights of peoples such was the spirit of the new time  the end of the crimean war and the peace of paris brought a temporary and superficial repose the french ruler by strange irony at once the sabre of revolution and the trumpet of order made a beginning in urging the constitution of a roumanian nationality by uniting the two danubian principalities in a single quasiindependent state this was obviously a further step towards that partition of turkey which the crimean war had been waged to prevent austria for reasons of her own objected and england still in her turcophil humour went with austria against france for keeping the two provinces although in fiscal and military union politically divided according to the fashion of that time—called a comedy by some a homage to the democratic evangel by others—a popular vote was taken its result was ingeniously falsified by the sultan whose ability to speak french was one of the odd reasons why lord palmerston was sanguine about turkish civilisation western diplomacy insisted that the question of union should be put afresh mr gladstone not then in office wrote to lord aberdeen sept 10 1857—       the course taken about the principalities has grieved me i do not     mean so much this or that measure as the principle on which it is     to rest i thought we made war in order to keep russia out and     then suffer life if it would to take the place of death but it     now seems to be all but avowed that the fear of danger not to     europe but to islam—and islam not from russia but from the     christians of turkey—is to be a ground for stinting their     liberties   in 1858 may 4 he urged the derby government to support the declared wish of the people of wallachia and moldavia and to fulfil the pledges made at paris in 1856 “surely the best resistance to be offered to russia” he said “is by the strength and freedom of those countries that will have to resist her you want to place a living barrier between russia and turkey there is no barrier like the breast of freemen” the union of the principalities would raise up antagonists to the ambitions of russia more powerful than any that could be bought with money the motion was supported by lord john russell and lord robert cecil but disraeli and palmerston joined in opposing it and it was rejected by a large majority mr gladstone wrote in his diary “may 4—h of c—made my motion on the principalities lost by 292114 and with it goes another broken promise to a people” so soon did the illusions and deceptions of the crimean war creep forth  in no long time 1858 roumania was created into a virtually independent state meanwhile much against napoleon’s wish and policy these proceedings chilled the alliance between france and england other powers grew more and more uneasy turning restlessly from side to side like sick men on their beds the object of russia ever since the peace had been first to break down the intimacy between england and france by flattering the ambition and enthusiasm of the french emperor next to wreak her vengeance on austria for offences during the crimean war still pronounced unpardonable austria in turn was far too slow for a moving age she entrenched herself behind forms with too little heed to substance and neighbours mistook her dulness for dishonesty for the diplomatic air was thick and dark with suspicion the rivalry of france and austria in italy was the oldest of european stories and for that matter the lombardovenetian province was a possession of material value to austria for while only containing oneeighth of her population it contributed onefourth of her revenue  m2 the central figure upon the european stage throughout the time on which we are now about to enter was the ruler of france the crimean war appeared to have strengthened his dynasty at home while faith in the depth of his political designs and in the grandeur of his military power had secured him predominance abroad europe hung upon his words a sentence to an ambassador at a public audience on new year’s day a paragraph in a speech at the opening of his parliament of puppets a pamphlet supposed to be inspired was enough to shake vienna turin london the vatican with emotions pitched in every key yet the mind of this imposing and mysterious potentate was the shadowy home of vagrant ideals and fugitive chimeras it was said by one who knew him well scratch the emperor and you will find the political refugee you will find that is to say the man of fluctuating hope without firm calculation of fact the man of halfshaped end with no sure eye to means the sphinx in our modern politics is usually something of a charlatan and in time the spite of fortune brought this mock napoleon into fatal conflict with the supple positive practical genius of italy in the person of one of the hardiest representatives of this genius that italy ever had just as ten years later the same nemesis brought him into collision with the stern rough genius of the north in the person of count bismarck meanwhile the sovereigns of central and northern europe had interviews at stuttgart at teplitz at warsaw it was at warsaw that the rulers of austria and prussia met the czar at the end of 1860—poland quivering as she saw the three crowned pirates choose the capital city of their victim for a rendezvous russia declined to join what would have been a coalition against france and the pope described the conference of warsaw as three sovereigns assembling to hear one of them communicate to the other two the orders of the emperor of the french the french empire was at its zenith thiers said that the greatest compensation to a frenchman for being nothing in his own country was the sight of that country filling its right place in the world  the reader will remember that at turin on his way home from the ionian islands in the spring of 1859 mr gladstone saw the statesman who was destined to make italy sir james hudson our ambassador at the court of piedmont had sounded cavour as to his disposition to receive the returning traveller cavour replied “i hope you will do all you can to bring such a proceeding about i set the highest value on the visit of a statesman so distinguished and such a friend of italy as mr gladstone” in conveying this message to mr gladstone feb 7 1859 hudson adds “i can only say i think your counsels may be very useful to this government and that i look to your coming here as a means possibly of composing differences which may if not handled by some such calm unprejudiced statesman as yourself lead to very serious disturbances in the european body politic” mr gladstone dined at cavour’s table at the foreign office where among other things he had the satisfaction of hearing his host speak of hudson as quel uomo italianissimo ministers the president of the chamber and other distinguished persons were present and cavour was well pleased to have the chance of freely opening his position and policy to “one of the sincerest and most important friends that italy had”2  among cavour’s difficulties at this most critical moment was the attitude of england the government of lord derby true to the austrian sympathies of his party and the german sympathies of the court accused italy of endangering the peace of europe “no” said cavour “it is the statesmen the diplomatists the writers of england who are responsible for the troubled situation of italy for is it not they who have worked for years to kindle political passion in our peninsula and is it not england that has encouraged sardinia to oppose the propaganda of moral influences to the illegitimate predominance of austria in italy” to mr gladstone who had seen the austrian forces in venetia and in lombardy he said “you behold for yourself that it is austria who menaces us here we are tranquil the country is calm we will do our duty england is wrong in identifying peace with the continuance of austrian domination” two or three days later the piedmontese minister made one of those momentous visits to paris that forced a will less steadfast than his own  the french emperor in his dealings with cavour had entangled himself in mr gladstone’s phrase with “a stronger and better informed intellect than his own” “two men” said guizot “at this moment divide the attention of europe the emperor napoleon and count cavour the match has begun i back count cavour” the game was long and subtly played it was difficult for the ruler who had risen to power by bloodstained usurpation and the perfidious ruin of a constitution to keep in step with a statesman the inspiring purpose of whose life was the deliverance of his country by the magic of freedom yet napoleon was an organ of european revolution in a double sense he proclaimed the doctrine of nationality and paid decorous homage to the principle of appeal to the popular voice in time england appeared upon the scene and by his flexible management of the two western powers england and france cavour executed the most striking political transformation in the history of contemporary europe it brought however as mr gladstone speedily found much trouble into the relations of the two western powers with one another  the overthrow of the derby government and the accession of the whigs exactly coincided in time with the struggle between austria and the francosardinian allies on the bloody fields of magenta and solferino a few days after mr gladstone took office the french and austrian emperors and king victor emmanuel signed those preliminaries of villafranca july 11 1859 which summarily ended an inconclusive war by the union of lombardy to the piedmontese kingdom and the proposed erection of an italian federation over which it was hoped that the pope might preside and of which venetia still remaining austrian should be a member the scheme was intrinsically futile but it served its turn the emperor of the french was driven to peace by mixed motives the carnage of solferino appalled or unnerved him he had revealed to his soldiers and to france that their ruler had none of the genius of a great commander the clerical party at home fiercely assailed the prolongation of a war that must put the pope in peril the case of poland the case of hungary might almost any day be kindled into general conflagration by the freshly lighted torch of nationality above all germany might stride forward to the rhine to avenge the repulse of austria on the po and the mincio3  whatever the motive villafranca was a rude check to italian aspirations cavour in poignant rage peremptorily quitted office rather than share responsibility for this abortive end of all the astute and deeplaid combinations for ten years past that had brought the hated austrian from the triumph of novara down to the defeat of solferino before many months he once more grasped the helm in the interval the movement went forward as if all his political tact his prudence his suppleness his patience and his daring had passed into the whole population of central italy for eight months after villafranca it seemed as if the deep and politic temper that built up the old roman commonwealth were again alive in bologna parma modena florence when we think of the pitfalls that lay on every side how easily france might have been irritated or estranged what unseasonable questions might not unnaturally have been forced forward what mischief the voice and spirit of the demagogue might have stirred up there can surely be no more wonderful case in history of strong and sagacious leaders cavour farini ricasoli the piedmontese king guiding a people through the ferments of revolt with discipline energy legality order selfcontrol to the achievement of a constructive revolution without the sword of france the work could not have been begun but it was the people and statesmen of northern and central italy who in these eight months made the consummation possible and england too had no inconsiderable share for it was she who secured the principle of nonintervention by foreign powers in italian affairs it was she who strongly favoured the annexation of central italy to the new kingdom in the north here it was that england directly and unconsciously opened the way to a certain proceeding that when it came to pass she passionately resented in the first three weeks of march 1860 victor emmanuel legalised in due form the annexation of the four central states to piedmont and lombardy and in the latter half of april he made his entry into florence cavour attended him and strange as it sounds he now for the first time in his life beheld the famed city—centre of undying beauty and so many glories in the history of his country and the genius of mankind in one spot at least his musings might well have been profound—the tomb of machiavelli the champion of principles three centuries before to guide that armed reformer part fox part lion who should one day come to raise up an italy one and independent the florentine secretary’s orb never quite sets and it was now rising to a lurid ascendant in the politics of europe for a long generation to come lighting up the unblest gospel that whatever policy may demand justice will allow4  m3 on march 24 cavour paid napoleon a bitter price for his assent to annexation by acquiescing in the cession to france of savoy and nice provinces that were one of them the cradle of the royal race the other the birthplace of garibaldi the hero of the people in this transaction the theory of the plébiscite or direct popular vote upon a given question for the first time found a place among the clauses of a diplomatic act the plébiscite though stigmatised as a hypocritical farce and often no better than a formal homage paid by violence or intrigue to public right was a derivative from the doctrines of nationality and the sovereignty of the people then ruling in europe the issue of the operation in savoy and nice was what had been anticipated italy bore the stroke with wise fortitude but england when she saw the bargain closed for which she had herself prepared the way took fierce umbrage at the aggrandisement of france and heavy clouds floated into the european sky as we have seen the first act of the extraordinary drama closed at villafranca the curtain fell next at florence upon the fusion of central with upper italy piedmont a secondary state had now grown to be a kingdom with eleven or twelve millions of inhabitants greater things were yet to follow ten millions still remained in the south under the yoke of bourbons and the vatican the third act most romantic most picturesque of all an incomparable union of heroism with policy at double play with all the shifts of circumstance opened a few weeks later  the great unsolved problem was the pope the french ambassador at the vatican in those days chanced to have had diplomatic experience in turkey he wrote to his government in paris that the pope and his cardinals reminded him of nothing so much as the sultan and his ulemas—the same vacillation the same shifty helplessness the same stubborn impenetrability the cross seemed in truth as grave a danger in one quarter of europe as was the crescent in another and the pope was now to undergo the same course of territorial partition as had befallen the head of a rival faith for ten years the priests had been maintained in their evilly abused authority by twenty thousand french bayonets—the bayonets of the empire that the cardinals with undisguised ingratitude distrusted and hated5 the emperor was eager to withdraw his force if only he were sure that no catastrophe would result to outrage the catholic world and bring down his own throne  unluckily for this design garibaldi interposed one night in may 1860 soon after the annexation to piedmont of the four central states the hero whom an admirer described as “a summary of the lives of plutarch” sailed forth from genoa for the deliverance of the sicilian insurgents in the eyes of garibaldi and his thousand sicily and naples marked the path that led to rome the share of cavour as accomplice in the adventure is still obscure whether he even really desired the acquisition of the neapolitan kingdom or would have preferred as indeed he attempted a federation between a northern kingdom and a southern is not established how far he had made certain of the abstention of louis napoleon how far he had realised the weakness of austria we do not authentically know he was at least alive to all the risks to which garibaldi’s enterprise must instantly expose him in every quarter of the horizon—from austria deeming her hold upon venetia at stake from the french emperor with hostile clericals in france to face from the whole army of catholics all over the world and not least from triumphant mazzinians his personal foes in whose inspirations he had no faith whose success might easily roll him and his policy into mire and ruin now as always with consummate suppleness he confronted the necessities of a situation that he had not sought and assuredly had neither invented nor hurried the politician he used to tell his friends must above all things have the tact of the possible well did manzoni say of him “cavour has all the prudence and all the imprudence of the true statesman” stained and turbid are the whirlpools of revolution yet the case of italy was overwhelming sir james hudson wrote to mr gladstone from turin april 3 1859—“piedmont cannot separate the question of national independence from the accidental existence of constitutional liberty in piedmont if she would misgovernment in central italy heavy taxation and dearth in lombardy misgovernment in modena vacillation in tuscany cruelty in naples constitute the famous grido di dolore the congress of paris wedded piedmont to the redress of grievances”  m4 in august 1860 garibaldi crossed from sicily to the mainland and speedily made his triumphant entry into naples the young king francis withdrew before him at the head of a small force of faithful adherents to capua afterwards to gaeta at the volturno the garibaldians meeting a vigorous resistance drove back a force of the royal troops enormously superior in numbers on the height of this agitated tide and just in time to forestall a fatal movement of garibaldi upon rome the sardinian army had entered the territories of the pope september 11    ii   in the series of transactions that i have sketched the sympathies of mr gladstone never wavered from the appearance of his neapolitan letters in 1851 he lost no opportunity of calling attention to italian affairs in 1854 he brought before lord clarendon the miserable condition of poerio settembrini and the rest he took great personal trouble in helping to raise and invest a fund for the settembrini family and elaborate accounts in his own handwriting remain in 1855 he wrote to lord john russell then starting for vienna as to a rumour of the adhesion of naples to the alliance of the western powers “in any case i can conceive it possible that the vienna conferences may touch upon italian questions and i sincerely rely upon your humanity as well as your love of freedom indeed the latter is but little in question to plead for the prisoners in the kingdom of the two sicilies detained for political offences real or pretended i do not ask you to leave any greater duty undone but to bear in mind the singular claims on your commiseration of these most unhappy persons if occasion offers”  as we have already seen it was long before he advanced to the view of the thoroughgoing school like nearly all his countrymen he was at first a reformer not a revolutionary to the marquis dragonetti mr gladstone wrote from broadstairs in 1854—       naples has a government as bad as anarchy rome unites the evils     of the worst government and the most entire anarchy in those     countries i can hardly imagine any change that would not be for     the better but in the wild opinions of some of your political     sectaries i see the best and most available defence of the     existing system with its hideous mischiefs almost every italian     who heartily desires the removal from italy and from the face of     the earth of the immeasurable evils which your country now suffers     through some of its governments adopts italian union and national     independence for his watchwords do not think it presumption     for it is the mere description of a fact if i say we in england     cannot bring our minds to this mode of looking at the italian     question all our habits all our instincts all our history lead     us in another direction in our view this is not building from the     bottom upwards but from the top downwards all our experience     has been to the effect that the champion of liberty should take     his ground not upon any remote or abstract proposition but upon     the right of man under every law divine and human first to good     government and next to the institutions which are the necessary     guarantees of it we sympathise strongly i believe with the     victims of misgovernment but the english mind is not shocked in     limine at the notion of people belonging to one race and     language yet politically incorporated or associated with another     and of italian unity i think the language of this nation would     be we shall be glad if it proves to be feasible but the     condition of it must be gradually matured by a course of     improvement in the several states and by the political education     of the people if it cannot be reached by these means it hardly     will be by any others and certainly not by opinions which closely     link italian reconstruction with european disorganisation and     general war   so far removed at this date was mr gladstone from the glorified democracy of the mazzinian propaganda he told cobden that when he returned from corfu in the spring of 1859 he found in england not only a government with strong austrian leanings but to his great disappointment not even the house of commons so alive as he could have wished upon the italian question “it was in my opinion the authority and zeal of lord palmerston and lord john russell in this question that kindled the country”  while europe was anxiously watching the prospects of war between france and austria mr gladstone spoke in debate april 18 1859 upon the situation to express his firm conviction that no plan of peace could be durable which failed to effect some mitigation of the sore evils afflicting the italian peninsula the course of events after the peace speedily ripened both his opinions and the sentiment of the country and he was as angry as his neighbours at the unexpected preliminaries of villafranca “i little thought” he wrote to poerio july 15 1859 “to have lived to see the day when the conclusion of a peace should in my own mind cause disgust rather than impart relief but that day has come i appreciate all the difficulties of the position both of the king of sardinia and of count cavour it is hardly possible for me to pass a judgment upon his resignation as a political step but i think few will doubt that the moral character of the act is high the duties of england in respect to the italian question are limited by her powers and these are greatly confined but her sentiments cannot change because they are founded upon a regard to the deepest among those principles which regulate the intercourse of men and their formation into political societies” by the end of the year he softened his judgment of the proceedings of the french emperor  m5 the heavy load of his other concerns did not absolve him in his conscience from duty to the italian cause—       jan 3 1860—i sat up till 2 am with my letter to ld j     russell about italy and had an almost sleepless night for it     4—2½ hours with the prince consort à deux reprises about the     italian question which was largely stated on both sides i     thought he admitted so much as to leave him no standing ground     5—went down to pembroke lodge and passed the evening with lord     john and his family lord john and i had much conversation on     italy   in a cabinet memorandum jan 3 1860 he declared himself bound in candour to admit that the emperor had shown “though partial and inconsistent indications of a genuine feeling for the italians—and far beyond this he has committed himself very considerably to the italian cause in the face of the world when in reply to all that we fling in his face the truce of villafranca he may reply—and the answer is not without force—that he stood singlehanded in a cause when any moment europe might have stood combined against him we gave him verbal sympathy and encouragement or at least criticism no one else gave him anything at all no doubt he showed then that he had undertaken a work to which his powers were unequal but i do not think that when fairly judged he can be said to have given proof by that measure of insincerity or indifference” this was no more than justice it is even less and both italians and englishmen have perhaps been too ready to forget that the freedom of italy would have remained an empty hope if napoleon iii had not unsheathed his sword  m6 after discussing details mr gladstone laid down in his memorandum a general maxim for the times that “the alliance with france is the true basis of peace in europe for england and france never will unite in any european purpose which is radically unjust” he put the same view in a letter to lacaita a few months later sept 16 “a close alliance between england and france cannot be used for mischief and cannot provoke any dangerous counter combination but a close alliance between england and other powers would provoke a dangerous counter combination immediately besides that it could not in itself be trusted my own leaning therefore is not indeed to place reliance on the french emperor but to interpret him candidly and in italian matters especially to recollect the great difficulties in which he is placed 1 because whether by his own fault or not he cannot reckon upon strong support from england when he takes a right course 2 because he has his own ultramontane party in france to deal with whom especially if not well supported abroad he cannot afford to defy”  as everybody soon saw it was the relation of louis napoleon to the french ultramontanes that constituted the tremendous hazard of the piedmontese invasion of the territories of the pope this critical proceeding committed cavour to a startling change and henceforth he was constrained to advance to italian unity a storm of extreme violence broke upon him gortchakoff said that if geography had permitted the czar would betake himself to arms in defence of the bourbon king prussia talked of reviving the holy alliance in defence of the law of nations against the overweening ambition of piedmont the french ambassador was recalled from turin still no active intervention followed  one great power alone stood firm and lord john russell wrote one of the most famous despatches in the history of our diplomacy october 27 1860 the governments of the pope and the king of the two sicilies he said provided so ill for the welfare of their people that their subjects looked to their overthrow as a necessary preliminary to any improvement her majesty’s government were bound to admit that the italians themselves are the best judges of their own interests vattel that eminent jurist had well said that when a people for good reasons take up arms against an oppressor it is but an act of justice and generosity to assist brave men in the defence of their liberties did the people of naples and the roman states take up arms against their government for good reasons upon this grave matter her majesty’s government held that the people in question are themselves the best judges of their own affairs her majesty’s government did not feel justified in declaring that the people of southern italy had not good reasons for throwing off their allegiance to their former governments her majesty’s government therefore could not pretend to blame the king of sardinia for assisting them so downright was the language of lord john we cannot wonder that such words as these spread in italy like flame that people copied the translation from each other weeping over it for joy and gratitude in their homes and that it was hailed as worth more than a force of a hundred thousand men6  the sensation elsewhere was no less profound though very different the three potentates at warsaw viewed the despatch with an emotion that was diplomatically called regret but more resembled horror the prince regent of prussia afterwards the emperor william told prince albert that it was a tough morsel a disruption of the law of nations and of the holy ties that bind peoples to their sovereigns7 many in england were equally shocked even sir james graham for instance said that he would never have believed that such a document could have passed through a british cabinet or received the approval of a british sovereign india ireland canada would await the application of the fatal doctrine that it contained it was a great public wrong a grave error and even garibaldi and mazzini would come out of the italian affair with cleaner hands yet today we may ask ourselves was it not a little idle to talk of the holy ties that bind nations to their sovereigns in respect of a system under which in naples thousands of the most respectable of the subjects of the king were in prison or in exile in the papal states ordinary justice was administered by roughhanded german soldiers and young offenders shot by courtmartial at the drumhead and in the lombardovenetian provinces press offences were judged by martial law with chains shooting and flogging for punishment8 whatever may be thought of lord john and his doctrine only those who hold to the converse doctrine that subjects may never rise against a king nor ever under any circumstances seek succour from foreign power will deny that the cruelties of naples and the iniquities connected with the temporal authority of the clergy in the states of the church constituted an irrefragable case for revolt  m7 within a few weeks after the troops of victor emmanuel had crossed the frontier sept 1860 the papal forces had been routed and a popular vote in the neapolitan kingdom supported annexation to piedmont the papal states with the exception of the patrimony of st peter in the immediate neighbourhood of rome itself fell into the hands of the king victor emmanuel and garibaldi rode into naples side by side nov 7 the bourbon flag after a long stand was at last lowered at the stronghold of gaeta feb 14 1861 the young bourbon king became an exile for the rest of his life and on february 18 the first parliament of united italy assembled at turin—venice and rome for a short season still outside a few months before mr gladstone had written a long letter to d’azeglio it was an earnest exposition of the economic and political ideals that seemed to shine in the firmament above a nation now emerging from the tomb the letter was to be shown to cavour “tell that good friend of ours” he replied “that our trade laws are the most liberal of the continent that for ten years we have been practising the maxims that he exhorts us to adopt tell him that he preaches to the converted”9 then one of those disasters happened that seem to shake the planetary nations out of their preappointed orbits cavour died10     chapter ii the great budget 18601861       it was said that by this treaty the british nation was about     blindly to throw herself into the arms of this constant and     uniform foe did it not much rather by opening new sources of     wealth speak this forcible language—that the interval of peace     as it would enrich the nation would also prove the means of     enabling her to combat her enemy with more effect when the day of     hostility should come it did more than this by promoting habits     of friendly intercourse and of mutual benefit while it     invigorated the resources of britain it made it less likely that     she should have occasion to call forth these resources—pitt     february 12 1787    i   as we survey the panorama of a great man’s life conspicuous peaks of time and act stand out to fix the eye and in our statesman’s long career the budget of 1860 with its spurs of appendant circumstance is one of these commanding points in the letter to acton already quoted p 1 mr gladstone says—       before parliament met in 1860 the ’situation’ was very greatly     tightened and enhanced by three circumstances first the     disaster in china11 secondly a visit of mr cobden’s to     hawarden when he proposed to me in a garden stroll the french     treaty and i for myself and my share adopted it nor have i     ever for a moment repented or had a doubt as rapidly as the     tender of office two months before thirdly and the gravest of     all the savoy affair if as is supposed i have quixotism in my     nature i can assure you that i was at this juncture much more     than satiated and could have wished with penelope that the     whirlwind would take me up and carry me to the shore of the great     stream of ocean12 and the wish would in this point not have     been extravagant the whirlwind was there ready to hand in and     from the midst of it was born the budget of 1860   the financial arrangements of 1859 were avowedly provisional and temporary and need not detain us the only feature was a rise in the income tax from fivepence to ninepence—its highest figure so far in a time of peace “my budget” he wrote to mrs gladstone july 16 “is just through the cabinet very kindly and well received no one making objection but lewis who preached low doctrine it confirms me in the belief i have long had that he was fitter for most other offices than for that i now hold” “july 21 or rather 22 one am—just come back from a long night and stiff contention at the house of commons it has been rather nice and close fighting disraeli made a popular motion to trip me up but had to withdraw it at any rate for the time this i can say it was not so that i used him i am afraid that the truce between us is over and that we shall have to pitch in as before”  the only important speech was one on italy august 813 of which disraeli said that though they were always charmed by the speaker’s eloquence this was a burst of even unusual brilliance and it gave pleasure in all quarters “spoke for an oretta short hour” says the orator “on italian affairs my best offhand speech” “the fish dinner” mr gladstone writes “went off very well and i think my proposing lord palmerston’s health without speech was decidedly approved i have had a warm message from lord lansdowne about my speech and lord p told me that on tuesday night as he went upstairs on getting home he heard lady p spouting as she read by candlelight it turned out to be the same effusion”  another incident briefly related to mrs gladstone brings us on to more serious ground “hawarden sept 12—cobden came early nothing could be better than the luncheon but i am afraid the dinner will be rather strong with local clergy i have had a walk and long talk with cobden who i think pleases and is pleased” this was the garden walk of which we have just heard where cobden the ardent hopeful sower scattered the good seed into rich ground the idea of a commercial treaty with france was in the air bright had opened it chevalier had followed it up persigny agreed cobden made an opportunity gladstone seized it cobden’s first suggestion had been that as he was about to spend a part of the winter in paris he might perhaps be of use to mr gladstone in the way of inquiry conversation expanded this into something more definite and more energetic why should he not with the informal sanction of the british government put himself into communication with the emperor and his ministers and work out with them the scheme of a treaty that should at once open the way to a great fiscal reform in both countries and in both countries produce a solid and sterling pacification of feeling cobden saw palmerston and tried to see lord john russell and though he hardly received encouragement at least he was not forbidden to proceed upon his volunteered mission14 “gladstone” wrote cobden to mr bright “is really almost the only cabinet minister of five years’ standing who is not afraid to let his heart guide his head a little at times” the emperor had played with the idea of a more open trade for five or six years and cobden with his union of economic moral and social elements and his incomparable gifts of argumentative persuasion was the very man to strike napoleon’s impressionable mind although having alienated the clericals by his italian policy the ruler of france might well have hesitated before proceeding to alienate the protectionists also he became a convert and did not shrink       both cobden and i says mr gladstone were keenly in favour of     such a treaty i myself certainly without intending thereby to     signify the smallest disposition to the promotion of tariff     treaties in general i had been an active party to the various     attempts under sir robert peel’s government to conclude such     treaties and was as far as possible removed from any disposition     to the renewal of labour which was in itself so profitless and     which was dangerously near to a practical assertion of a false     principle namely that the reductions of indirect taxation     permitted by fiscal considerations are in themselves injurious to     the country that makes them and are only to be entertained when a     compensation can be had for them15  the correspondence which     would in the ordinary course have been exchanged between the     foreign offices of the two countries was carried through in a     series of personal letters between mr cobden and myself i     remember indeed that the emperor or his government were desirous     to conceal from their own foreign minister walewski the fact     that such a measure was in contemplation on our side the method     pursued was only recommended by practical considerations i     contemplated including the conditions of the french treaty in a     new and sweeping revision of the tariff the particulars of which     it was of course important to keep from the public eye until they     were ready to be submitted to parliament   at the end of 1859 the question of the treaty was brought into the cabinet and there met with no general opposition though some objection was taken by lewis and wood based on the ground that they ought not to commit themselves by treaty engagements to a sacrifice of revenue until they had before them the income and the charges of the year writing to his wife about some invitation to a country house mr gladstone says jan 11 1860—       i cannot go without a clear sacrifice of public duty for the     measure is of immense importance and of no less nicety and here     it all depends on me lord john backs me most cordially and well     but it is no small thing to get a cabinet to give up one and a     half or two millions of revenue at a time when all the public     passion is for enormous expenditure and in a case beset with     great difficulties in fact a majority of the cabinet is     indifferent or averse but they have behaved very well i almost     always agree with lewis on other matters but in trade and finance     i do not find his opinions satisfactory till it is through this     vital question will need my closest and most anxious attention     two days later he writes the cabinet has been again on the     french treaty there are four or five zealous perhaps as many who     would rather be without it it has required pressure but we have     got sufficient power now if the french will do what is     reasonable lord john has been excellent palmerston rather     neutral it is really a great european operation a fortnight     later jan 28 a word to say i have opened the fundamental     parts of my budget in the cabinet and that i could not have hoped     a better reception nothing decided for i did not ask it and     indeed the case was not complete but there was no general     resistance no decided objection the tone of questioning was     favourable granville and argyll delighted newcastle i think     ditto thank god      to cobden jan 28—criticism is busy but the only thing really     formidable is the unavowed but strong conflict with that     passionate expectation of war which no more bears disappointment     than if it were hope or love feb 6—cobbett once compared an     insignificant public man in an important situation to the     linchpin in the carriage and my position recalls his very apt     figure to my mind   of course in his zeal for the treaty and its connection with tariff reform mr gladstone believed that the operation would open a great volume of trade and largely enrich the country but in one sense this was the least of it—       i had a reason of a higher order the french emperor had launched     his project as to savoy and nice it should have been plain to all     those who desired an united italy that such an italy ought not to     draw savoy in its wake a country severed from it by the     mountains by language by climate and i suppose by pursuits but     it does not follow that savoy should have been tacked on to     france while for the annexation of nice it was difficult to find     a word of apology but it could scarcely be said to concern our     interests while there was not the shadow of a case of honour the     susceptibilities of england were however violently aroused even     lord russell used imprudent language in parliament about looking     for other allies a french panic prevailed as strong as any of the     other panics that have done so much discredit to this country for     this panic the treaty of commerce with france was the only     sedative it was in fact a counterirritant and it aroused the     sense of commercial interest to counteract the war passion it was     and is my opinion that the choice lay between the cobden treaty     and not the certainty but the high probability of a war with     france undated memo    ii   out of the commercial treaty grew the whole of the great financial scheme of 1860 by his first budget mr gladstone had marked out this year for a notable epoch in finance happily it found him at the exchequer the expiry of certain annuities payable to the public creditor removed a charge of some two millions and mr gladstone was vehemently resolved that this amount should not “pass into the great gulf of expenditure there to be swallowed up” if the year in such circumstances is to pass he said to cobden “without anything done for trade and the masses it will be a great discredit and a great calamity” the alterations of duty required for the french treaty were made possible by the lapse of the annuities and laid the foundation of a plan that averted the discredit and calamity of doing nothing for trade and nothing for the masses of the population france engaged to reduce duties and remove prohibitions on a long list of articles of british production and export iron the most important—“the daily bread of all industries” as cobden called it england engaged immediately to abolish all duties upon all manufactured articles at her ports and to reduce the duties on wine and brandy the english reductions and abolitions extended beyond france to the commodities of all countries alike mr gladstone called 1860 the last of the cardinal and organic years of emancipatory fiscal legislation it ended a series of which the four earlier terms had been reached in 1842 in 1845 in 1846 and 1853 with the french treaty he used to say the movement in favour of free trade reached its zenith  m8 the financial fabric that rose from the treaty was one of the boldest of all his achievements and the reader who seeks to take the measure of mr gladstone as financier in comparison with any of his contemporaries in the western world will find in this fabric ample material16 various circumstances had led to an immense increase in national expenditure the structure of warships was revolutionised by the use of iron in place of wood it was a remarkable era in artillery and guns were urgently demanded of new type in the far east a quarrel had broken out with the chinese the threats of french officers after the plot of orsini had bred a sense of insecurity in our own borders thus more money than ever was required more than ever economy was both unpopular and difficult the annual estimates stood at seventy millions when mr gladstone framed his famous budget seven years before that charge stood at fiftytwo millions if the sole object of a chancellor of the exchequer be to balance his account mr gladstone might have contented himself with keeping the incometax and duties on tea and sugar as they were meeting the remissions needed by the french treaty out of the sum released by the expiry of the long annuities or he might have reduced tea and sugar to a peace rate and raised the incometax from ninepence to a shilling instead of taking this easy course mr gladstone after having relinquished upwards of a million for the sake of the french treaty now further relinquished nearly a million more for the sake of releasing 371 articles from duties of customs and a third million in order to abolish the vexatious excise duty upon the manufacture of paper nearly one million of all this loss he recouped by the imposition of certain small charges and minor taxes and by one or two ingenious expedients of collection and account and the other two millions he made good out of the lapsed annuities tea and sugar he left as they were and the incometax he raised from ninepence to tenpence severe economists not quite unjustly called these small charges a blot on his escutcheon time soon wiped it off for in fact they were a failure  the removal of the excise duty upon paper proved to be the chief stumblingblock and ultimately it raised more excitement than any other portion of the scheme the fiscal project became by and by associated with a constitutional struggle between lords and commons in the commons the majority in favour of abolishing the duty sank from fiftythree to nine troubles with china caused a demand for new expenditure the yield from the paper duty was wanted and the lords finding in all this a plausible startingpoint for a stroke of party business or for the assertion of the principle that to reject a repealing money bill was not the same thing as to meddle with a bill putting on a tax threw it out then when the lords had rejected the bill many who had been entirely cool about taking off the ’taxes upon knowledge’—for this unfavourable name was given to the paper duty by its foes—rose to exasperation at the thought of the peers meddling with votes of money all this we shall see as we proceed  this was the broad outline of an operation that completed the great process of reducing articles liable to customs duties from 1052 as they stood in 1842 when peel opened the attack upon them from 466 as mr gladstone found them in 1853 and from 419 as he found them now down to 48 at which he now left them17 simplification had little further to go “why did you not wait” he was asked “till the surplus came which notwithstanding all drawbacks you got in 1863 and then operate in a quiet way without disturbing anybody”18 his answer was that the surplus would not have come at all because it was created by his legislation “the principle adopted” he said “was this we are now 1860 on a high tableland of expenditure this being so it is not as if we were merely meeting an occasional and momentary charge we must consider how best to keep ourselves going during a period of high charge in order to do that we will aggravate a momentary deficiency that we may thereby make a great and permanent addition to productive power” this was his ceaseless refrain—the steadfast pursuit of the durable enlargement of productive power as the commanding aim of high finance    iii   at the beginning of the year the public expectation was fixed upon lord john russell as the protagonist in the approaching battle of parliamentary reform and the eager partizans at the carlton club were confident that on reform they would pull down the ministry the partizans of another sort assure us that “the whole character of the session was changed by mr gladstone’s invincible resolution to come forward in spite of his friends and in defiance of his foes for his own aristeia or innings” the explanation is not goodnatured and we know that it is not true but what is true is that when february opened the interest of the country had become centred at its highest pitch in the budget and the commercial treaty as the day for lifting the veil was close at hand mr gladstone fell ill and here again political benevolence surmised that his disorder was diplomatic an entry or two from phillimore’s journal will bring him before us as he was—       jan 29—gladstone’s emaciation in the past fortnight alarms me     as it has i find many other persons feb 5—gladstone     seriously ill all the afternoon in downing street a slight     congestion of the lungs great treaty and financial speech put off     till thursday was to have been tomorrow gladstone wished to see     me but i would only stay a minute by his bedside he looked very     pale he must not speak for ten days or ferguson his doctor     said he will meet canning’s fate feb 6—with gladstone in the     evening he is still in bed but visibly better feb 7—with     gladstone a long time in the morning found him much better though     still in bed annoyed at the publication of the new treaty with     france in the belgian papers it being part of the scheme of his     finance measure feb 8—gladstone drove out today bent on     speaking the day after tomorrow ferguson allows him i again     protested feb 9—saw gladstone he is better but i am     frightened at the proposed exertion of friday feb 10—saw     gladstone in the morning radiant with expected success and again     at night at 10 o’clock in downing street still more radiant with     triumph spoke for three hours and fifty minutes without     suffering thinks that the house will accept all that is material     in his finance scheme feb 13—dined with gladstone ordered     not to leave the house this week feb 25—called on the     gladstones at breakfast time found them both exceedingly happy at     the immense majority of 116 which affirmed last night the     principle of his grand budget19 his hard dry cough distresses     me gladstone thinks he has done what pitt would have done but for     the french revolution with characteristic modesty he said “i am     a dwarf on the shoulders of a giant”   mr gladstone’s own entries are these—       feb 10 ’60—spoke 59 without great exhaustion aided by a     great stock of egg and wine thank god home at 11 this was the     most arduous operation i have ever had in parliament march     9—spoke on various matters in the treaty debate voted in     28256 a most prosperous ending to a great transaction in which i     heartily thank god for having given me a share march 23—a long     day of 16½ hours’ work   of the speech in which the budget was presented everybody agreed that it was one of the most extraordinary triumphs ever witnessed in the house of commons the casual delay of a week had raised expectation still higher hints dropped by friends in the secret had added to the general excitement and as was truly said by contemporaries suspense that would have been fatal to mediocrity actually served mr gladstone even the censorious critics of the leading journal found in the largeness and variety of the scheme its greatest recommendation as suggesting an accord between the occasion the man and the measure so marvellous that it would be a waste of all three not to accept them among other hearers was lord brougham who for the first time since he had quitted the scene of his triumphs a generation before came to the house of commons and for four hours listened intently to the orator who had now acquired the supremacy that was once his own “the speech” said bulwer “will remain among the monuments of english eloquence as long as the language lasts” napoleon begged lord cowley to convey his thanks to mr gladstone for the copy of his budget speech he had sent him which he said he would preserve “as a precious souvenir of a man who has my thorough esteem and whose eloquence is of a lofty character commensurate with the grandeur of his views” prince albert wrote to stockmar march 17 “gladstone is now the real leader of the house and works with an energy and vigour almost incredible”20  almost every section of the trading and political community looked with favour upon the budget as a whole though it was true that each section touched by it found fault with its own part mr gladstone said that they were without exception free traders but not free traders without exception the magnitude and comprehensiveness of the enterprise seized the imagination of the country at the same time it multiplied sullen or uneasy interests the scheme was no sooner launched than the chancellor of the exchequer was overwhelmed by deputations within a couple of days he was besieged by delegates from the paper makers distillers came down upon him merchants interested in the bonding system wholesale stationers linen manufacturers maltsters licensed victuallers all in turn thronged his anteroom he was now says greville feb 15 “the great man of the day” the reduction of duties on currants created lively excitement in greece and mr gladstone was told that if he were to appear there he could divide honours with bacchus and triptolemus the latest benefactors of that neighbourhood  m9 political onlookers with whom the wish was not alien to their thought soon perceived that in spite of admiration for splendid eloquence and incomparable dexterity it would not be all sunshine and plain sailing at a very early moment the great editor of the times went about saying that gladstone would find it hard work to get his budget through if peel with a majority of ninety needed it all to carry his budget what would happen to a government that could but command a majority of nine21 both the commercial treaty and the finance speedily proved to have many enemies before the end of march phillimore met a parliamentary friend who like everybody else talked of gladstone and confirmed the apprehension that the whigs obeyed and trembled and were frightened to death “we don’t know where he is leading us” said hayter who had been whipperin on the last day of the month phillimore enters “march 30—gladstone has taken his name off the carlton which i regret it is a marked and significant act of entire separation from the whole party and will strengthen disraeli’s hands the whigs hate gladstone the moderate conservatives and the radicals incline to him the old tories hate him” for reasons not easy to trace a general atmosphere of doubt and unpopularity seemed suddenly to surround his name  the fortunes of the budget have been succinctly described by its author—       they were chequered and they were peculiar in this that the     first blow struck was delivered by one of the best among its     friends lord john russell keenly alive to the discredit of any     tampering as in former years with the question of the franchise     insisted on introducing his reform bill on march 1 when the     treaty and the financial proposals of the year numerous and     complex as they were had not proceeded beyond their early stages     this was in flat violation of a rule of lord bacon’s even more     weighty now than in his time which sir james graham was fond of     quoting “never overlap business” the enemies of the treaty were     thus invited to obstruct it through prolonged debating on reform     and the enemies of reform to discharge a corresponding office by     prolonged debating on the finance a large majority of the house     were in disguised hostility to the extension of the franchise the     discussions on it were at once protracted intermittent and     languid no division was taken against it it was defeated by the     pure vis inertiæ of the house skilfully applied and it was     withdrawn on june 11 but it had done its work by delaying the     tail of the financial measures until a time when the marriage     effected by the treaty between england and france had outlived its     parliamentary honeymoon there had intervened the savoy and nice     explosion settlement with china was uncertain the prospects of     the harvest were bad french invasion was apprehended by many men     usually rational the paper duty bill which would have passed the     commons by a large majority in the beginning of march only     escaped defeat on may 8 by a majority of nine22   when lord john had asked the cabinet to stop the budget in order to fix a day for his second reading mr gladstone enters in an autobiographic memorandum of his latest years23—       i said to him “lord john i will go down on my knees to you to     entreat you not to press that request” but he persevered and     this although he was both a loyal colleague and a sincere friend     to the budget and to the french treaty when reform was at last     got rid of in order to prosecute finance we had much to do and     in the midst of it there came upon us the news of hostilities in     china which demanded at once an increase of outlay  sufficient     to destroy my accruing balance and thus to disorganise the     finance of the year the opposition to the paper bill now assumed     most formidable dimensions during a long course of years there     had grown up in the house of commons a practice of finally     disposing of the several parts of the budget each by itself and     the house of lords had shown so much selfcontrol in confining     itself to criticism on matters of finance that the freedom of the     house of commons was in no degree impaired but there was the     opportunity of mischief and round the carcass the vultures now     gathered in overwhelming force it at once became clear that the     lords would avail themselves of the opportunity afforded them by     the single presentation of financial bills and would prolong and     virtually reenact a tax which the representatives of the people     had repealed   on may 5 the diary reports “cabinet lord palmerston spoke 34 hour against paper duties bill i had to reply cabinet against him except a few wood and cardwell in particular three wild schemes of foreign alliance are afloat our old men 2 are unhappily our youngest” palmerston not only spoke against the bill as he had a right in cabinet to do but actually wrote to the queen that he was bound in duty to say that if the lords threw out the bill—the bill of his own cabinet—“they would perform a good public service”24                    ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  phillimore’s notes show that the intense strain was telling on his hero’s physical condition though it only worked his resolution to a more undaunted pitch—       may 9—found gladstone in good spirits in spite of the narrow     majority on the paper duty last night but ill with a cough may     15—the whigs out of office and perhaps in abusing gladstone     and lauding g lewis i had much conversation with walpole told     me he henley and those who went with them would have followed     gladstone if he had not joined this government but added he was     justified in doing so may 18—gladstone is ill vexed and     indignant at the possible and probable conduct of the peers on     monday nothing will prevent him from denouncing them in the     commons if they throw out the paper bill as having violated in     substance and practically the constitution meanwhile his     unpopularity flows on    iv   the rejection of the bill affecting the paper duty by the lords was followed by proceedings set out by mr gladstone in one of his political memoranda dated may 26 1860—       though i seldom have time to note the hairbreadth ’scapes of which     so many occur in these strange times and with our strangely     constructed cabinet yet i must put down a few words with respect     to the great question now depending between the lords and the     english nation on sunday when it was well known that the paper     duties bill would be rejected i received from lord john russell a     letter which enclosed one to him from lord palmerston lord     palmerston’s came in sum to this that the vote of the lords would     not be a party vote that as to the thing done it was right     that we could not help ourselves that we should simply acquiesce     and no minister ought to resign lord john in his reply to this     stated that he took a much more serious view of the question and     gave reasons then he went on to say that though he did not agree     in the grounds stated by lord palmerston he would endeavour to     arrive at the same conclusion his letter accordingly ended with     practical acquiescence and he stated to me his concurrence in     lord palmerston’s closing proposition      thereupon i wrote an immediate reply we met in cabinet to     consider the case lord palmerston started on the line he had     marked out i think he proposed to use some meaningless words in     the house of commons as to the value we set on our privileges and     our determination to defend them if attacked by way of garniture     to the act of their abandonment upon this i stated my opinions     coming to the point that this proceeding of the house of lords     amounted to the establishment of a revising power over the house     of commons in its most vital function long declared exclusively     its own and to a divided responsibility in fixing the revenue and     charge of the country for the year besides aggravating     circumstances upon which it was needless to dwell in this     proceeding nothing would induce me to acquiesce though i     earnestly desired that the mildest means of correction should be     adopted this was strongly backed in principle by lord john who     thought that as public affairs would not admit of our at once     confining ourselves to this subject we should take it up the     first thing next session and send up a new bill practical as     well as other objections were taken to this mode of proceeding     and opposition was continued on the merits lord palmerston keen     and persevering he was supported by the chancellor wood     granville in substance lewis and cardwell who thought nothing     could be done but were ready to join in resigning if thought fit     lord john gibson and i were for decided action argyll leaned     the same way newcastle was for inquiry to end in a declaratory     resolution villiers thought some step necessary grey argued     mildly inclined i think to inaction herbert advised resignation     opposed any other course somerset was silent which i conceive     meant inaction at last palmerston gave in and adopted with but     middling grace the proposition to set out with inquiries and with     the intention to make as little of the matter as he could      his language in giving notice on tuesday of the committee went     near the verge of saying we mean nothing an unsatisfactory     impression was left on the house not a syllable was said in     recognition of the gravity of the occasion lord john had     unfortunately gone away to the foreign office i thought i should     do mischief at that stage by appearing to catch at a part in the     transaction yesterday all was changed by the dignified     declaration of lord john i suggested to him that he should get     up and lord palmerston who had intended to keep the matter in     his own hands gave way but lord palmerston was uneasy and said     “you won’t pitch it into the lords” and other things of the same     kind on the whole i hope that in this grave matter at least we     have turned the corner   as we know even the fighting party in the cabinet was forced to content itself for the moment with three protesting resolutions lord palmerston and his chancellor of the exchequer both spoke in parliament “the tone of the two remonstrances” says mr gladstone euphemistically “could not be in exact accord but by careful steering on my part and i presume on his all occasion of scandal was avoided” not altogether perhaps phillimore says—       july 6—a strange and memorable debate palmerston moving     resolution condemnatory of the lords and yet speaking in defence     of their conduct gladstone most earnestly and eloquently     condemning them and declaring that action and not resolutions     became the house of commons and that though he agreed to the     language and spirit of the resolutions if action were proposed he     would support the proposal and taunted the conservatives with     silently abetting “a gigantic innovation on the constitution”     loudly and tempestuously cheered by the radicals and no one else     yet he was the true conservative at this moment but ought he to     have spoken this as chancellor of the exchequer and from the     treasury bench after the first lord of the treasury had spoken in     almost totally opposite sense the answer may be that it was a     house of commons and not a government question i fear he is very     unwell and i greatly fear killing himself 17—“i have lived” he     said speaking of the debate on the lords and the paper duty “to     hear a radical read a long passage from mr burke amid the jeers     and scoffs of the socalled conservatives”   the struggle still went on—       july 20—h of c lost my savings bank monies bill my first     defeat in a measure of finance in the h of c this ought to be     very good for me and i earnestly wish to make it so      aug 6—h of c spoke 1½ hour on the paper duty a favourable     house voted in 266233 a most kind and indeed notable reception     afterwards      aug 7—this was a day of congratulations from many kind mp’s   the occasion of the notable reception was the moving of his resolutions reducing the customs duty on imported paper to the level of the excise duty this proceeding was made necessary by the treaty and was taken to be as mr gladstone intended that it should be a clear indication of further determination to abolish customs duty and excise duty alike the first resolution was carried by 33 and when he rose to move the second the cheering from the liberal benches kept him standing for four or five minutes—cheering intended to be heard the whole length of the corridor that led to another place25  m10 the great result as greville says in a sentence that always amused the chief person concerned is “to give some life to halfdead brokendown and tempesttossed gladstone” in this rather tame fashion the battle ended for the session but the blaze in the bosom of the chancellor of the exchequer was inextinguishable as the lords in good time found out their rejection of the paper duties bill must have had no inconsiderable share in propelling him along the paths of liberalism the same proceeding helped to make him more than ever the centre of popular hopes he had taken the unpopular side in resisting the inquiry into the miscarriages of the crimea in pressing peace with russia in opposing the panic on papal aggression on the bill for divorce and on the bill against church rates and he represented with fidelity the constituency that was least of all in england in accord with the prepossessions of democracy yet this made no difference when the time came to seek a leader “there is not” mr bright said in the course of this quarrel with the lords “a man who labours and sweats for his daily bread there is not a woman living in a cottage who strives to make her home happy for husband and children to whom the words of the chancellor of the exchequer have not brought hope and to whom his measures which have been defended with an eloquence few can equal and with a logic none can contest have not administered consolation”  at the end of the session phillimore reports—       aug 12—gladstone is physically weak requires rest air and     generous living he discoursed without the smallest reserve upon     political affairs the feebleness of the government mainly     attributable to the absence of any effective head palmerston’s     weakness in the cabinet and his low standard for all public     conduct he said in peel’s cabinet a cabinet minister if he had a     measure to bring forward consulted peel and then the cabinet     nobody thought of consulting palmerston first but brought his     measure at once to the cabinet gladstone said his work in the     cabinet had been so constant and severe that his work in the house     of commons was refreshing by comparison i never heard him speak     so strongly of the timidity and vacillation of his comrades the     last victory which alone preserved the government from dropping     to pieces was won in spite of them    v   in a contemporary memorandum may 30 1860 on the opinions of the cabinet at this date mr gladstone sets out the principal trains of business with which he and his colleagues were called upon to deal it is a lively picture of the vast and diverse interests of a minister disposed to take his cabinet duties seriously it is too a curious chart of the currents and crosscurrents of the time here are the seven heads as he sets them down—       1 the italian question—austrian or antiaustrian 2 foreign     policy in general—leaning towards calm and peace or brusqueness     and war 3 defences and expenditure—alarm and money charges on     the one side modest and timid retrenchment with confidence in our     position on the other 4 finance as adapted to the one or the     other of these groups of ideas and feelings respectively 5     reform—ultraconservative on the one side on the other no fear     of the working class and the belief that something real though     limited should be done towards their enfranchisement 6 church     matters may perhaps be also mentioned though there has been no     collision in regard to them whatever difference there may be—they     have indeed held a very secondary place amidst the rude and     constant shocks of the last twelve months 7 lastly the coup     d’état on the paper duties draws a new line of division   m11 “in the many passages of argument and opinion” mr gladstone adds “the only person from whom i have never to my recollection differed on a serious matter during this anxious twelvemonth is milner gibson” the reader will find elsewhere the enumeration of the various parts in this complex dramatic piece26 some of the most italian members of the cabinet were also the most combative in foreign policy the most martial in respect of defence the most stationary in finance in the matter of reform some who were liberal as to the franchise were conservative as to redistribution in matters ecclesiastical those who like mr gladstone were most liberal elsewhere were with sympathy from argyll “most conservative and churchlike”       on the paper duties there are i think only three members of the     cabinet who have a strong feeling of the need of a remedy for the     late aggression—lord john russell gibson w e g—and lord john     russell leans so much upon palmerston in regard to foreign affairs     that he is weaker in other subjects when opposed to him than     might be desired with us in feeling are more or less newcastle     argyll villiers on the other side and pretty decidedly—first     and foremost lord palmerston after him the chancellor     granville lewis wood cardwell herbert it is easy to judge     what an odd shifting of parts takes place in our discussions we     are not mr burke’s famous mosaic but we are a mosaic in     solution that is to say a kaleidoscope27 when the instrument     turns the separate pieces readjust themselves and all come out     in perfectly novel combinations such a cabinet ought not to be     acephalous   before he had been a year and a half in office mr gladstone wrote to graham nov 27 ’60 “we live in antireforming times all improvements have to be urged in apologetic almost in supplicatory tones i sometimes reflect how much less liberal as to domestic policy in any true sense of the word is this government than was sir robert peel’s and how much the tone of ultratoryism prevails among a large portion of the liberal party” “i speak a literal truth” he wrote to cobden “when i say that in these days it is more difficult to save a shilling than to spend a million” “the men” he said “who ought to have been breasting and stemming the tide have become captains general of the alarmists” and he deplored cobden’s refusal of office when the palmerston government was formed all this only provoked him to more relentless energy well might prince albert call it incredible    vi   after the “gigantic innovation” perpetrated by the lords mr gladstone read to the cabinet june 30 1860 an elaborate memorandum on the paper duty and the taxing powers of the two houses he dealt fully alike with the fiscal and the constitutional aspects of a situation from which he was “certain that nothing could extricate them with credit except the united determined and even authoritative action of the government” he wound up with a broad declaration that to any who knew his tenacity of purpose when once roused made it certain that he would never acquiesce in the pretensions of the other house the fiscal consideration he concluded “is nothing compared with the vital importance of maintaining the exclusive rights of the house of commons in matter of supply there is hardly any conceivable interference of the lords hereafter except sending down a tax imposed by themselves which would not be covered by this precedent it may be said they are wise and will not do it assuming that they will be wise yet i for one am not willing that the house of commons should hold on sufferance in the nineteenth century what it won in the seventeenth and confirmed and enlarged in the eighteenth”  the intervening months did not relax this valiant and patriotic resolution he wrote down a short version of the story in the last year of his life—       the hostilities in china reached a rather early termination and     in the early part of the session of 1861 it appeared almost     certain that there would be a surplus for 18612 such as i thought     would make it possible again to operate on the paper duties     unfortunately the income tax was at so high a rate that we could     not reasonably hope to carry paper duty repeal without taking a     penny off the tax the double plan strained the probable means     afforded by the budget in this dilemma i received most valuable     aid from the shrewd ingenuity of milner gibson who said why not     fix the repeal of the paper duty at a later date than had been     intended say on the 10th of october which will reduce the loss     for the year i gladly adopted the proposition and proposed a     budget reducing the income tax by one penny and repealing the     paper duties from october 10 1861 with this was combined what     was more essential than either—the adoption of a new practice with     respect to finance which would combine all the financial measures     of the year in a single bill we had separate discussions in the     cabinet on the constitutional proposal the single bill it was     not extensively resisted there though quietly a good deal     misliked i rather think the chancellor campbell took strong     objection to it and i well remember that the duke of newcastle     gave valuable and telling aid so it was adopted the budget was     the subject of a fierce discussion in which lord palmerston     appeared to me to lose his temper for the first and only time the     plan however to my great delight was adopted it was followed     by a strange and painful incident i received with astonishment     from lord palmerston immediately after the adoption of the     budget a distinct notice that he should not consider it a cabinet     question in the house of commons where it was known that the     opposition and the paper makers would use every effort to destroy     the plan i wrote an uncontroversial reply with some     selfrepression and showed it to granville who warmly approved     and was silent on the letter of lord palmerston the battle in     parliament was hard but was as nothing to the internal fighting     and we won it we likewise succeeded in the plan of uniting the     financial proposals in one bill to this spencer walpole gave     honourable support and it became a standing rule the house of     lords for its misconduct was deservedly extinguished in effect     as to all matters of finance   of the “internal fighting” we have a glimpse in the diary—       april 10 ’61—saw lord palmerston and explained to him my     plans which did not meet his views a laborious and anxious day     11—cabinet explained my case 13 chaos 12—cabinet 13 very     stiff we ’broke up’ in one sense and all but in another     13—cabinet 3346 my plan as now framed was accepted lord     palmerston yielding gracefully stanley of alderley almost the     only kicker the plan of one bill was accepted after fighting     15—h of c financial statement for three hours the figures     rather made my head ache it was the discharge of a long pentup     excitement may 13—lord jr again sustained me most handsomely     in debate lord p after hearing graham amended his speech but     said we must not use any words tending to make this a vote of     confidence 30—h of c spoke one hour on omission of clause iv     that repealing the paper duty and voted in 296281 one of the     greatest nights in the whole of my recollection june     1—yesterday was a day of subsiding excitement today is the     same habit enables me to expel exciting thought but not the     subtler nervous action which ever comes with a crisis 7—today’s     debate in the h of l was a great event for me   the abiding feature of constitutional interest in the budget of 1861 was this inclusion of the various financial proposals in a single bill so that the lords must either accept the whole of them or try the impossible performance of rejecting the whole of them this was the affirmation in practical shape of the resolution of the house of commons in the previous year that it possessed in its own hands the power to remit and impose taxes and that the right to frame bills of supply in its own measure manner time and matter is a right to be kept inviolable until now the practice had been to make the different taxes the subject of as many different bills thus placing it in the power of the lords to reject a given tax bill without throwing the financial machinery wholly out of gear by including all the taxes in a single finance bill the power of the lords to override the other house was effectually arrested  m12 in language of that time he had carried every stitch of freetrade canvas in the teeth of a tempest that might have made the boldest financial pilot shorten sail many even of his friends were sorry that he did not reduce the war duty on tea and sugar instead of releasing paper from its duty of excise neither friends nor foes daunted him he possessed his soul in patience until the hour struck and then came forth in full panoply enthusiastic journalists with the gift of a poetic pen told their millions of readers how after weeks of malign prophecy that the great trickster in downing street would be proved to have beggared the exchequer that years of gloom and insolvency awaited us suddenly the moment the magician chose to draw aside the veil the darkness rolled away he had fluttered out of sight the whole race of sombre volscians and where the gazers dreaded to see a gulf they beheld a golden monument of glorious finance like the traveller in the arabian fable who was pursued in the valley of shadows by unearthly imprecations he never glanced to right or left until he could disperse the shadows by a single stroke “he is” says another onlooker “in his ministerial capacity probably the best abused and the best hated man in the house nevertheless the house is honestly proud of him and even the country party feels a glow of pride in exhibiting to the diplomatic gallery such a transcendent mouthpiece of a nation of shopkeepers the audacious shrewdness of lancashire married to the polished grace of oxford is a felicitous union of the strength and culture of liberal and conservative england and no party in the house whatever may be its likings or antipathies can sit under the spell of mr gladstone’s rounded and shining eloquence without a conviction that the man who can talk ‘shop’ like a tenth muse is after all a true representative man of the market of the world”  in describing the result of the repeal of the paper duty a little after this28 he used glowing words “never was there a measure so conservative as that which called into vivid energetic permanent and successful action the cheap press of this country” it was also a common radical opinion of that hour that if the most numerous classes acquired the franchise as well as cheap newspapers the reign of peace would thenceforth be unbroken in a people of bold and martial temper such as are the people of our island this proved to be a miscalculation meanwhile there is little doubt that mr gladstone’s share in thus fostering the growth of the cheap press was one of the secrets of his rapid rise in popularity     chapter iii battle for economy 18601862       the session of 1860 with its complement in the principal part of     1861 was i think the most trying part of my whole political     life—gladstone 1897      in reading history we are almost tempted to believe that the     chief end of government in promoting internal quiet has been to     accumulate greater resources for foreign hostilities—channing    i   all this time the battle for thrifty husbandry went on and the bark of the watchdog at the exchequer sounded a hoarse refrain “we need not maunder in antechambers” as mr disraeli put it “to discover differences in the cabinet when we have a patriotic prime minister appealing to the spirit of the country and when at the same time we find his chancellor of the exchequer whose duty it is to supply the ways and means by which those exertions are to be supported proposing votes with innuendo and recommending expenditure in a whispered invective”  m13 severer than any battle in parliament is a long struggle inside a cabinet opponents contend at closer quarters the weapons are shorter it is easier to make mischief mr gladstone was the least quarrelsome of the human race he was no wrestler intent only on being a winner in olympic games nor was he one of those who need an adversary to bring out all their strength but in a cause that he had at heart he was untiring unfaltering and indomitable parallel with his contention about budget and treaty in 1860 was persistent contention for economy the financial crisis went on with the fortifications crisis the battle was incessant he had not been many months in office before those deep differences came prominently forward in temperament tradition views of national policy that continued to make themselves felt between himself and lord palmerston so long as the government endured perhaps i should put it more widely and say between himself and that vast body of excited opinion in the country of which lord palmerston was the cheerful mouthpiece the struggle soon began  sidney herbert then at the war office after circulating a memorandum wrote privately to mr gladstone nov 23 1859 that he was convinced that a great calamity was impending in the shape of a war provoked by france officers who had visited that country told him that all thinking men in france were against war with england all noisy men for it the army for it and above all the government for it inspired pamphlets were scattered broadcast everything was determined except time and occasion the general expectation was for next summer french tradesmen at st malo were sending in their bills to the english thinking war coming “we have to do with a godless people who look on war as a game open to all without responsibility or sin and there is a man at the head of them who combines the qualities of a gambler and a fatalist”  mr gladstone replied in two letters one of them nov 27 of the stamp usual from a chancellor of the exchequer criticising a swollen estimate with controversial doubts pungent interrogatories caustic asides hints for saving here and paring there on the following day he fired what he called his second barrel in the shape of a letter which states with admirable force and fulness the sceptic’s case against the scare this time it was no ordinary exchequer wrestle he combats the inference of an english from an italian war by the historic reminder that a struggle between france and austria for supremacy or influence in italy had been going on for four whole centuries so that its renewal was nothing strange if france now unable to secure our cooperation still thought the italian danger grave enough to warrant singlehanded intervention how does that support the inference that she must certainly be ready to invade england next he ridicules the conclusion that the invasion was at our doors from such contested allegations as that the châlons farmers refused the loan of horses from the government because they would soon be wanted back again for the approaching war with england what extraordinary farmers to refuse the loan of horses for their ploughing and seed time because they might be reclaimed for purposes of war before winter then why could we not see a single copy of the incendiary and antienglish pamphlets said to be disseminated broadcast among the troops what was the value of all this contested and unsifted statement why if he were bent on a rupture did the emperor not stir at the moment of the great mutiny when every available man we had was sent to india and when he had what might have passed for a plausible excuse in the orsini conspiracy and in the deliberate and pointed refusal of parliament to deal with it with emphasis he insists that we have no adequate idea of the predisposing power which an immense series of measures of preparation for war on our own part have in actually begetting war they familiarise ideas which when familiar lose their horror and they light an inward flame of excitement of which when it is habitually fed we lose the consciousness  this application of cool and reasoned common sense to actual probabilities seldom avails against imaginations excited by random possibilities and he made little way lord palmerston advanced into the field in high anxiety that the cabinet should promptly adopt herbert’s proposal29 they soon came to a smart encounter and mr gladstone writes to the prime minister feb 7 1860 “there are i fear the most serious differences among us with respect to a loan for fortifications my mind is made up and to propose any loan for fortifications would be on my part with the views i entertain a betrayal of my public duty” a vigorous correspondence between mr gladstone and herbert upon military charges followed and the tension seemed likely to snap the cord  m14 if i may judge from the minutes of the members of the cabinet on the papers circulated most of them stood with their chief and not one of them not even milner gibson nor villiers was ready to proceed onward from a sort of general leaning towards mr gladstone’s view to the further stage of making a strong standup fight for it the controversy between him and his colleagues still raged at red heat over the whole ground of military estimates the handling of the militia and the construction of fortifications he wrote memorandum upon memorandum with untiring energy pressing the cabinet with the enormous rate in the increase of charge with the slight grounds on which increase of charge was now ordinarily proposed and entertained and most of all with the absence of all attempt to compensate for new and necessary expenditure by retrenchment in quarters where the scale of outlay had either always been or had become unnecessary he was too sound a master of the conditions of public business to pretend to take away from the ministers at the head of the great departments of expenditure their duty of devising plans of reduction but he boldly urged the reconsideration of such large general items of charge as the military expenditure in the colonies then standing at an annual burden of over two millions on the taxpayers of this country he was keen from the lessons of experience to expose the ever indestructible fallacy that mighty armaments make for peace  still the cabinet was not moved and in palmerston he found a will and purpose as tenacious as his own “the interview with lord palmerston came off today” he writes to the duke of argyll june 6 1860 “nothing could be more kind and frank than his manner the matter was first to warn me of the evils and hazards attending for me the operation of resigning secondly to express his own strong sense of the obligation to persevere both of these i told him i could fully understand he said he had had two great objects always before him in life—one the suppression of the slave trade the other to put england in a state of defence in short it appears that he now sees as he considers the opportunity of attaining a long cherished object and it is not unnatural that he should repel any proposal which should defraud him of a glory in and by absolving him from a duty i am now sure that lord palmerston entertained this purpose when he formed the government but had i been in the slightest degree aware of it i should certainly but very reluctantly have abstained from joining it and helped as i could from another bench its italian purposes still i am far indeed from regretting to have joined it which is quite another matter”  now labouring hard in paris month after month at the tariff cobden plied mr gladstone with exhortations to challenge the alarmists on the facts to compare the outlay by france for a dozen years past on docks fortifications arsenals with the corresponding outlay by england to show that our steam navy building and afloat to say nothing of our vast mercantile marine was at least double the strength of france and above all to make his colleagues consider whether the french emperor had not as a matter of selfinterest made the friendship of england from the first the hinge of his whole policy cobden as always knew thoroughly and in detail what he was talking about for he had sat for three successive sessions on a select committee upon army navy and ordnance expenditure in another letter he turned personally to mr gladstone himself “unconsciously” he says “you have administered to the support of a system which has no better foundation than a gigantic delusion” june 11 1860 “you say unconsciously” mr gladstone replies june 13 “i am afraid that in one respect this is too favourable a description i have consciously as a member of parliament and as a member of the government concurred in measures that provide for an expenditure beyond what were it in my power i would fix but i suppose that the duty of choosing the lesser evil binds me the difficulty is to determine what the lesser evil is”  m15 my story grows long and it ends as such stories in our politics usually end a compromise was arranged on the initiative of the duke of somerset keeping clear as mr gladstone supposed of the fortification scheme as a whole and not pledging future years30 “never at any time in my life” mr gladstone told graham “have i had such a sense of mental and moral exhaustion” the strain was not ended by the compromise for in moving the resolution for a vote of two millions for fortifications july 23 lord palmerston not only declared that he held it to be absolutely necessary to carry the whole scheme into effect—the very proposition which the compromise put aside—but defended it by a series of stringent criticisms particularly fitted to offend and irritate france mr gladstone was not present31 but he felt strongly that he had good grounds of complaint and that faith had not been strictly kept “much dismayed” he wrote in his diary july 24 “at the terms of lord palmerston’s resolution” it was now however too late to draw back32 mr bright made a weighty and masterly attack aug 2 hinting plainly that the thing was “a compromise to enable the government to avoid the rock or get over the quicksand which this question has interjected into their midst” and quoting with excellent effect a pregnant passage from peel “if you adopt the opinion of military men naturally anxious for the complete security of every available point naturally anxious to throw upon you the whole responsibility for the loss in the event of war suddenly breaking out of some of our valuable possessions—you would overwhelm this country with taxes in time of peace” but this was a palmerstonian parliament the year before a remarkable debate july 21 1859 had promised better things disraeli had opened it with emphatic declarations “there is no country” he said “that can go on raising seventy millions in time of peace with impunity england cannot and if england cannot no country can” bright followed with the assurance that cobden and he might now consider mr disraeli a convert to their views lord john russell came next agreeing with bright and even palmerston himself was constrained to make a peace speech    ii   in may 1861 mr gladstone notes “a day of over fourteen hours thank god for the strength” the atmosphere around him would have depressed a weaker man “at brooks’s” says phillimore “they hate gladstone worse than at the carlton” in the summer the strife upon expenditure was renewed eventually mr gladstone was able to write to graham from the cabinet room july 20 1861 that castor and pollux appeared aloft at the right moment and the clouds had disappeared in a letter to his close friend sir walter james in 1871 mr gladstone says “the storm of criticism and rebuke does not surprise nor discourage me doubtless much must be just and what is not is what we call in logic an ‘inseparable accident’ of politics time and reflection will please god enable us to distinguish between them for my own part i never was so abused as in 1860 but it was one of the most useful or least useless years of my life” the battle was as severe in 1861 as it had been the year before in the middle of the session may 9 phillimore reports “found gladstone in good spirits he spoke with real greatness of mind of the attacks made on him”  m16 the next year lord palmerston wrote to express his concern at something that he came upon in a railway journey “i read with much interest” he wrote to his chancellor of the exchequer april 29 1862 “your able and eloquent speeches at manchester but i wish to submit to you some observations upon the financial part of the second speech” he did not agree with mr gladstone that the nation had forced the cabinet and parliament into high expenditure but if it were so he regarded it not as matter of reproach but as a proof of the nation’s superior sagacity panic there had been none governors and governed had for a long time been blind and apathetic then they awoke there was on the other side of the channel a people who say what they may hate us and would make any sacrifice to humiliate us and they had now at their head an able active wary councilkeeping but everplanning sovereign napoleon iii “have the parliament and the nation been wrong and have bright and cobden and yourself been right” all this being so he could not but regret that mr gladstone should by speeches in and out of parliament invite agitation to force the government of which he was a member to retrace its steps taken deliberately and with full sense of responsibility33 to palmerston’s eight quarto pages written in one of the finest hands of the time mr gladstone replied in twelve       in all good humour he said i prefer not being classed with mr     bright or even mr cobden first because i do not know their     opinions with any precision and secondly because as far as i do     know or can grasp them they seem to contemplate fundamental     changes in taxation which i disapprove in principle and believe     also to be unattainable in practice and reductions of     establishment and expenditure for which i am not prepared to be     responsible i think it a mean and guilty course to hold out     vague and indefinite promises of vast retrenchment but i think it     will be a healthful day both for the country and for the party     over which you so ably preside when the word retrenchment of     course with a due regard to altered circumstances shall again     take its place among their battle cries   a spirited correspondence followed for lord palmerston knew his business and had abundant faculty of application while mr gladstone for his part was too much in earnest to forego rejoinder and even surrejoinder “no claptrap reductions” cried the prime minister “you are feeding not only expenditure” rejoined the chancellor of the exchequer “but what is worse the spirit of expenditure” “you disclaim political community of opinion with bright and cobden and justly” said lord palmerston “but you cannot but be aware that owing to various accidental circumstances many people at home and abroad connect you unjustly with them and this false impression is certainly not advantageous”  “my dear gladstone” he wrote goodhumouredly on another occasion “you may not have seen how your name is taken in vain by people with whom i conceive you do not sympathise—yours sincerely  palmerston”  enclosed was a placard with many large capital letters notes of exclamation italics and all the rest of the paraphernalia of political emphasis—       tax payers read mr cobden’s new pamphlet the “three panics”     and judge for yourselves how long will you suffer yourselves to     be humbugged by palmerstonianism and robbed by the “services”     and others interested in a war expenditure even in times of     peace  the chancellor of the exchequer appeals to you to help     him you have the power in your own hands if you will only exert     it reform the house of commons and do it thoroughly this time   of the continuance of the struggle in 1862 a few items from the diary give an adequate picture—       jan 30 1862—a heavy blow in the announcement of increased     military estimates from sir george lewis gave me a disturbed     evening 31—worked on the formidable subject of the estimates     and made known to the cabinet my difficulties feb 1—cabinet     3½—6 it went well the tenth penny on the incometax proved to     be a strong physic £750000 of reductions ordered 12—wrote mem     on possible reductions etc to dispense with incometax the     whole question i think is can we be satisfied i think we ought     and will with 21 millions for army and navy instead of 27 march     1—cabinet 334—614 very stiff on the belgian negotiations i     had to go to the ultima ratio 31—h of c the fortifications got     their first blow   by midsummer public feeling veered a little “the tide has turned lord palmerston is now ‘the strong swimmer in his agony’ ”34  a candid and friendly observer has told us the situation “when i was private secretary to lord palmerston” he says “and mr gladstone was his chancellor of the exchequer it was a constant source of sorrow to me and a perpetual cause of mystery to note how they misunderstood one another and how evidently each mistrusted the other though perfectly cordial and most friendly in their mutual intercourse if the proposal was adhered to mr gladstone gave way this seemed to lord palmerston a case of gratuitous difficulties put in his way and attempts to thwart without the courage to resist”35  in closing this chapter let us note that in spite of lord palmerston he won no inconsiderable success when 1866 came and his financial administration ended he had managed with the aid of the reduction of debt charge after the lapse of the long annuities to carry expenditure back to the level of 1857 naval expenditure rose until 1861 and then began to fall army expenditure rose until 1863 and then began to fall in 1859 when he went to the exchequer the total under these two heads was nearly twentysix millions when he quitted office in 1866 the total was twentyfour millions in the middle years it had swelled to twentyeight after half a dozen years of panic and extravagance all sedulously fostered by a strong prime minister that he should still have left the cost of government little higher than he found it was no defeat but an extremely satisfactory performance “we must follow the nature of our affairs” burke says “and conform ourselves to our situation why should we resolve to do nothing because what i propose to you may not be the exact demand of the petition if we cry like children for the moon like children we must cry on”36    iii   m17 ruminating in the late evening of life over his legislative work mr gladstone wrote “selecting the larger measures and looking only to achieved results i should take the following heads 1 the tariffs 184260 2 oxford university act 3 post office savings banks 4 irish church disestablishment 5 irish land acts 6 franchise act although this excludes the last of all the efforts viz the irish government bill” the third item in the list belongs to the period 1861 at which we have now arrived       the points to be noted are three 1 the whole of my action in     185965 was viewed with the utmost jealousy by a large minority     and a section of the very limited majority it was an object to me     to get this bill passed sub silentio a full statement of my     expectations from it would have been absolutely fatal i admit     they have been more than realised 2 the trustee savings banks     were doubly defective nay trebly for they sometimes broke 1     their principle was left in doubt—were the general funds in trust     or cash at a banker’s this was vital 2 they never got or could     get within the doors of the masses for they smelt of class it     was necessary to provide for the savings of the people with a     safety b cheapness c convenience the banks cost money     to the state the post office savings banks bring in a revenue 3     behind all this i had an object of firstrate importance which     has been attained to provide the minister of finance with a     strong financial arm and to secure his independence of the city     by giving him a large and certain command of money   a sequel to this salutary measure was a bill three years later with the apparently unheroic but really beneficent object of facilitating the acquisition of small annuities without the risk of fraud or bankruptcy37 an eyewitness tells how march 7 1864 “mr gladstone held the house for two hours enchained by his defence of a measure which avowedly will not benefit the class from which members are selected which involves not only a ‘wilderness of figures’ but calculations of a kind as intelligible to most men as equations to london cabdrivers and which though it might and would interest the nation would never in the nature of things be made a hustings cry the riveted attention of the house was in itself a triumph the deep impression received by the nation on the following day was a greater one it was felt that here was a man who really could lead instead of merely reflecting the conclusions of the popular mind” the measure encountered a pretty stiff opposition the insurance companies were vexed that they had neglected their proper business others feared that it might undermine the poor law others again took the pessimist’s favourite line that it would be inoperative but the case was good mr gladstone’s hand was firm and in due time the bill became law amid a loud chorus of approval  m18 thus he encouraged stimulated and facilitated private and personal thrift at the same time and in the same spirit in which he laboured his fervid exhortations to national economy he was deeply convinced he said and kept saying “that all excess in the public expenditure beyond the legitimate wants of the country is not only a pecuniary waste but a great political and above all a great moral evil it is a characteristic of the mischiefs that arise from financial prodigality that they creep onwards with a noiseless and a stealthy step that they commonly remain unseen and unfelt until they have reached a magnitude absolutely overwhelming” he referred to the case of austria where these mischiefs seemed to threaten the very foundations of empire     chapter iv the spirit of gladstonian finance 18591866       nations seldom realise till too late how prominent a place a sound     system of finance holds among the vital elements of national     stability and wellbeing how few political changes are worth     purchasing by its sacrifice how widely and seriously human     happiness is affected by the downfall or the perturbation of     national credit or by excessive injudicious and unjust     taxation—lecky    i   in finance the most important of all the many fields of his activity mr gladstone had the signal distinction of creating the public opinion by which he worked and warming the climate in which his projects throve in other matters he followed as it was his business and necessity to follow the governing forces of the public mind in finance he was a strenuous leader he not only led with a boldness sometimes verging on improvidence apart from the merits of this or that proposal he raised finance to the high place that belongs to it in the interest curiosity and imperious concern of every sound selfgoverning community even its narrowest technicalities by his supple and resplendent power as orator were suffused with life and colour when ephemeral critics disparaged him as mere rhetorician—and nobody denies that he was often declamatory and discursive that he often overargued and overrefined—they forgot that he nowhere exerted greater influence than in that department of affairs where words out of relation to fact are most surely exposed if he often carried the proper rhetorical arts of amplification and development to excess yet the basis of fact was both sound and clear and his digressions as when for example he introduced an account of the changes in the english taste for wine38 were found and still remain both relevant and extremely interesting  m19 one recorder who had listened to all the financiers from peel downwards said that peel’s statements were ingenious and able but dry disraeli was clever but out of his element wood was like a cart without springs on a heavy road gladstone was the only man who could lead his hearers over the arid desert and yet keep them cheerful and lively and interested without flagging another is reminded of sir joshua’s picture of garrick between tragedy and comedy such was his duality of attitude and expression such the skill with which he varied his moods in a single speech his fervid eloquence and passion his lightness and buoyancy of humour his lambent and spontaneous sarcasm just as macaulay made thousands read history who before had turned from it as dry and repulsive so mr gladstone made thousands eager to follow the public balancesheet and the whole nation became his audience interested in him and his themes and in the house where his dazzling wonders were performed all this made a magnificent contribution to the national spirit of his time such extraordinary power over others had its mainspring in the depths and zeal of his own conviction and concern “for nine or ten months of the year” he told sir henry taylor in 1864 “i am always willing to go out of office but in the two or three that precede the budget i begin to feel an itch to have the handling of it last summer i should have been delighted to go out now december i am indifferent in february if i live as long i shall i have no doubt be loath but in april quite ready again such are my signs of the zodiac” the eagerness of his own mind transmitted itself like an electric current through his audience  interest abroad was almost as much alive as the interest felt in england itself we have already seen how keenly cavour followed mr gladstone’s performances his budget speeches were circulated by foreign ministers among deputies and editors fould one of the best of napoleon’s finance ministers kept up a pretty steady correspondence with the english chancellor appeals to him as to the sound doctrine on sugar drawbacks is much struck by his proposals on scotch banks says mournfully to him april 28 1863 in a sentence that is a whole chapter in the history of the empire “you are very fortunate in being able to give such relief to the taxpayers if it had not been for the war in mexico i should perhaps have been able to do something of the same sort and that would have been especially in view of the elections very favourable to the government of the emperor’”  when mr gladstone came to leave office in 1866 he said to fould july 11 “the statesmen of today have a new mission opened to them the mission of substituting the concert of nations for their conflicts and of teaching them to grow great in common and to give to others by giving to themselves of this beneficent work a good share has fallen to the departments with which we have respectively been connected” fould had already deplored his loss “i counted” he says “on the influence of your wise doctrines in finance to help me in maintaining our country in that system of order and economy of which you were setting the example” alas in france and in continental europe generally at that time selfish material interests and their class representatives were very strong popular power was weak in most of them the soldier was the master happily for our famous chancellor of the exchequer england was different  it has often been said that he ignored the social question did not even seem to know there was one the truth is that what marks him from other chancellors is exactly the dominating hold gained by the social question in all its depth and breadth upon his most susceptible imagination tariff reform adjustment of burdens invincible repugnance to waste or profusion accurate keeping and continuous scrutiny of accounts substitution of a few good taxes for many bad ones—all these were not merely the love of a methodical and thrifty man for habits of business they were directly associated in him with the amelioration of the hard lot of the toiling mass and sprang from an ardent concern in improving human wellbeing and raising the moral ideals of mankind in his “musings for the good of man” liberation of intercourse to borrow his own larger name for free trade figured in his mind’s eye as one of the promoting conditions of abundant employment “if you want” he said in a pregnant proposition “to benefit the labouring classes and to do the maximum of good it is not enough to operate upon the articles consumed by them you should rather operate on the articles that give them the maximum of employment” in other words you should extend the area of trade by steadily removing restrictions he recalled the days when our predecessors thought it must be for man’s good to have “most of the avenues by which the mind and also the hand of man conveyed and exchanged their respective products” blocked or narrowed by regulation and taxation dissemination of news travelling letters transit of goods were all made as costly and difficult as the legislator could make them “i rank” he said “the introduction of cheap postage for letters documents patterns and printed matter and the abolition of all taxes on printed matter in the catalogue of free trade legislation these great measures may well take their place beside the abolition of prohibitions and protective duties the simplifying of revenue laws and the repeal of the navigation act as forming together the great code of industrial emancipation”39  m20 it was not unnatural that fault should be found with him for not making a more resolute effort to lighten the burden of that heavy mortgage which under the name of the national debt we have laid upon the industry and property of the nation in 1866 he was keenly excited by jevons’s argument from the ultimate shrinkage of our coal supply and he accepted the inference that we should vigorously apply ourselves by reduction of the debt to preparation for the arrival of the evil day but as he wrote to jevons march 16 1866 “until the great work of the liberation of industry was in the main effected it would have been premature or even wrong to give too much prominence to this view of the subject nor do i regard that liberation as yet having reached the point at which we might say we will now cease to make remission of taxes a principal element and aim in finance but we are in my judgment near it and i am most anxious that the public should begin to take a closer and more practical view of the topics which you have done so much to bring into prominence”  he was always thinking of the emancipation of commerce like peel and cobden his general policy was simple when great expenditure demanded large revenue he raised his money by high incometax and high rates of duty on a few articles neither absolute necessities of life nor raw materials of manufacture he left the incometax at fourpence in 1866 he told the house that the new parliament then about to be elected might dispense with the tax “if” he said “parliament and the country preferred to retain the tax then the rate of fourpence is the rate at which in time of peace and in the absence of any special emergency we believe it may be most justly and wisely so retained” while cordially embracing cobden’s policy of combining free trade with retrenchment he could not withstand a carnal satisfaction at abundant revenue deploring expenditure with all his soul he still rubs his hands in professional pride at the elasticity of the revenue under his management    ii   when it is asked with no particular relevancy what original contribution of the first order was made by mr gladstone to the science of national finance we may return the same answer as if it were asked of walpole pitt or peel it was for adam smith from his retreat upon the seabeach of distant kirkcaldy to introduce new and fruitful ideas though he too owed a debt to french economists the statesman’s business is not to invent ideas in finance but to create occasions and contrive expedients for applying them “what an extraordinary man pitt is” said adam smith “he understands my ideas better than i understand them myself” originality may lie as much in perception of opportunity as in invention cobden discovered no new economic truths that i know of but his perception of the bearings of abstract economic truths upon the actual and prospective circumstances of his country and the world made him the most original economic statesman of his day the glory of mr gladstone was different it rested on the practical power and tenacity with which he opened new paths and forced the application of sound doctrine over long successions of countless obstacles  m21 if we probe his fame as financier to the core and marrow it was not his power as orator it was not his ingenuity in device and expedient it was his unswerving faith in certain fixed aims and his steadfast and insistent zeal in pursuing them that built up the splendid edifice pitt performed striking financial feats especially in the consolidation of duties in reformed administration and in the french treaty of 1786 but illfortune dragged him into the vortex of european war and finance sank into the place of a secondary instrument an art for devising aliments some of them desperate enough for feeding the warchest of the nation sir robert walpole mr gladstone wrote “had not to contend with like difficulties and i think his administration should be compared with the early years of pitt in which way of judging he would come off second though a man of cool and sagacious judgment while morally he stood low”40  in the happier conditions of his time mr gladstone was able to use wise and bold finance as the lever for enlarging all the facilities of life and diffusing them over the widest area if men sometimes smile at his extraordinary zeal for cheap wines and cheap books and low railway fares if they are sometimes provoked by his rather harsh views on privileges for patents and copyrights for authors restrictive of the common enjoyment it is well to remember that all this and the like came from what was at once clear financial vision and true social feeling “a financial experience” he once said “which is long and wide has profoundly convinced me that as a rule the state or individual or company thrives best which dives deepest down into the mass of the community and adapts its arrangements to the wants of the greatest number” his exultation in the stimulus given by fiscal freedom to extended trade and therefore to more abundant employment at higher wages was less the exultation of the economist watching the intoxicating growth of wealth than of the social moralist surveying multiplied access to fuller life and more felicity i always remember in a roving talk with him in 1891 when he was a very old man and ill how he gradually took fire at the notion—i forget how it arose—of the iniquities under which the poor man suffered a generation ago “see—the sons and daughters went forth from their homes the cost of postage was so high that correspondence was practically prohibited yet the rich all the time by the privilege of franking carried on a really immense amount of letterwriting absolutely free think what a softening of domestic exile what an aid in keeping warm the feel of family affection in mitigating the rude breach in the circle of the hearth” this vigorous sympathy was with mr gladstone a living part of his christian enthusiasm “if you would gain mankind” said old jeremy bentham “the best way is to appear to love them and the best way of appearing to love them is to love them in reality” when he thought of the effect of his work at the exchequer he derived “profound and inestimable consolation from the reflection that while the rich have been growing richer the poor have become less poor” yet as my readers have by this time found out there never was a man less in need of aristotle’s warning that to be forever hunting after the useful befits not those of free and lofty soul41 as was noted by contemporaries like all the followers of sir robert peel he never thought without an eye to utilitarian results but mixed with that attitude of mind he had “a certain refinement and subtlety of religiousness that redeemed it from the coldness if it sometimes overshadowed the clearness of mere statesmanlike prudence” on the other hand he had “the lancashire temperament”    iii   m22 this thought and feeling for the taxpayer was at the root of another achievement no less original than the peculiar interest that he was able to excite by his manner of stating a financial case peel was only prime minister for five years and only four months chancellor mr gladstone was prime minister for twelve—ten years short of sir robert walpole in that office seven years short of pitt but he was also chancellor of the exchequer under three other prime ministers for ten years thus his connection with the treasury covered a longer period than was attained by the greatest of his predecessors his long reign at the treasury and his personal predominance in parliament and the country enabled him to stamp on the public departments administrative principles of the utmost breadth and strength thrift of public money resolute resistance to waste rigid exactitude in time and all the other aspects of official duty conviction that in the working of the vast machinery of state nothing is a trifle—through the firm establishment of maxims and principles of this sort mr gladstone built up a strong and efficacious system of administrative unity that must be counted a conspicuous part of his very greatest work “no chancellor of the exchequer” he once said “is worth his salt who makes his own popularity either his first consideration or any consideration at all in administering the public purse in my opinion the chancellor of the exchequer is the trusted and confidential steward of the public he is under a sacred obligation with regard to all that he consents to spend”42 this tone of thinking and feeling about the service of the state spread under his magisterial influence from chancellors and the permanent officers that bear unobtrusive but effective sway in whitehall down to tide waiters and distributors of stamps as burke put the old latin saw he endeavoured to “give us a system of economy which is itself a great revenue” the exchequer and audit act of 1866 is a monument of his zeal and power in this direction it converted the nominal control by parliament into a real control and has borne the strain of nearly forty years  he was more alive than any man at the exchequer had ever been before to the mischiefs of the spirit of expenditure as he told the house of commons in 1863 april 16 “i mean this that together with the socalled increase of expenditure there grows up what may be termed a spirit of expenditure a desire a tendency prevailing in the country which insensibly and unconsciously perhaps but really affects the spirit of the people the spirit of parliament the spirit of the public departments and perhaps even the spirit of those whose duty it is to submit the estimates to parliament” “but how” he wrote to cobden jan 5 1864 “is the spirit of expenditure to be exorcised not by my preaching i doubt if even by yours i seriously doubt whether it will ever give place to the old spirit of economy as long as we have the incometax there or hard by lie questions of deep practical moment” this last pregnant reference to the incometax makes it worth while to insert here a word or two from letters of 1859 to his brother robertson an even more ardent financial reformer than himself—       economy is the first and great article economy such as i     understand it in my financial creed the controversy between     direct and indirect taxation holds a minor though important place     i have not the smallest doubt we should at this moment have had a     smaller expenditure if financial reformers had not directed their     chief attention not to the question how much of expenditure and     taxes we shall have but to the question how it should be     raised i agree with you that if you had only direct taxes you     would have economical government but in my opinion the indirect     taxes will last as long as the monarchy and while we have them i     am deeply convinced that the facility of recurring to and of     maintaining incometax has been a main source of that     extravagance in government which i date from the russian war for     before that a good spirit had prevailed for some twentyfive     years   bagehot that economist who united such experience and sense with so much subtlety and humour wrote to mr gladstone in 1868 “indirect taxation so cramps trade and heavy direct taxation so impairs morality that a large expenditure becomes a great evil i have often said so to sir g lewis but he always answered ‘government is a very rough business you must be content with very unsatisfactory results’ ” this was a content that mr gladstone never learned  m23 it was not only in the finance of millions that he showed himself a hero “the chancellor of the exchequer” he said “should boldly uphold economy in detail and it is the mark of a chickenhearted chancellor when he shrinks from upholding economy in detail when because it is a question of only two or three thousand pounds he says that is no matter he is ridiculed no doubt for what is called candleends and cheeseparings but he is not worth his salt if he is not ready to save what are meant by candleends and cheeseparings in the cause of the country”43 he held it to be his special duty in his office not simply to abolish sinecures but to watch for every opportunity of cutting down all unnecessary appointments he hears that a clerk at the national debt office is at death’s door and on the instant writes to lord palmerston that there is no necessity to appoint a successor during the last twenty years he said in 1863 “since i began to deal with these subjects every financial change beneficial to the country at large has been met with a threat that somebody would be dismissed” all such discouragements he treated with the half scornful scepticism without which no administrative reformer will go far  he did not think it beneath his dignity to appeal to the foreign office for a retrenchment in flyleaves and thick folio sheets used for docketing only and the same for mere covering despatches without description for all these had to be bound and the bound books wanted bookcases and the bookcases wanted buildings and the libraries wanted librarians “my idea is that it would be quite worth while to appoint an official committee from various departments to go over the ‘contingencies’ and minor charges of the different departments into which abuse must always be creeping from the nature of the case and without much blame to any one” sir r bethell as attorneygeneral insisted on the duty incumbent on certain high officials including secretaries of state of taking out patents for their offices and paying the stamp duties of two hundred pounds apiece thereon “i shall deal with these eminent persons” he wrote to the chancellor of the exchequer “exactly as i should and do daily deal with john smith accused of fraud as a distiller or john brown reported as guilty of smuggling tobacco” mr gladstone replies 1859—       i rejoice to see that neither the heat the stench nor service in     the courts can exhaust even your superfluous vigour and it is     most ennobling to see such energies devoted to the highest of all     purposes—that of replenishing her majesty’s exchequer i hope     however that in one point the case stands better than i had     supposed the proof of absolute contumacy is not yet complete     though alas the animus furandi stands forth in all its hideous     colours i spoke yesterday to lord palmerston on the painful     theme and he confessed to me with much emotion that he has not     yet resorted to those mild means of exhortation—what the     presbyterians call dealing with an erring brother—from which we     had hoped much the unhappy men may therefore yet come to their     senses in any case i rejoice to think that you in the new     capacity of mad doctor are sure to cure them and abate the     mischief if the which do not happen i quote the new tennyson—      “some evil chance     will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze     before the people and our lord the king”44   after a due amount of amusing correspondence the recusant confederacy struck their colours and paid their money       when he went to corfu in the terrible in 1858 some two or three     sleeping cabins were made by wooden partitions put up round spaces     taken off the deck thirteen years after his unslumbering memory     made this an illustrating point in an exhortation to a first lord     of the admiralty not to disregard small outgoings “i never in my     life was more astonished than upon being told the sum this had     cost i think it was in hundreds of pounds where i should have     expected tens” sometimes no doubt this thrift descended to the     ludicrous on this same expedition to corfu among the small     pieces of economy enjoined by mr gladstone on the members of his     mission one was to scratch out the address on the parchment label     of the despatch bags and to use the same label in returning the     bag to the colonial office in london one day while the secretary     was busily engaged in thus saving a few halfpence an officer came     into the room having arrived by a special steamer from trieste at     a cost of between seven and eight hundred pounds the ordinary     mailboat would have brought him a very few hours later we can     hardly wonder that the heroical economist denounced such pranks as     “profligate” and much else though an individual case may often     enough seem ludicrous yet the system and the spirit engendered by     it were to the taxpayer that is to the nation priceless    iv   one of the few failures of this active and fruitful period was the proposal 1863 that charities should pay incometax upon the returns from their endowments what is their exemption but the equivalent of a gift to them from the general taxpayer he has to make good the sum that ought in reason and equity to have been paid by them as by other people to the government that protects them why should this burden be compulsorily laid upon him what is the quality of an endowment for a charitable purpose that constitutes a valid claim for such a boon into this case mr gladstone threw himself with full force the opposition to him was as heated and as vigorous as he ever provoked and the violence of the resistance roused an answering vehemence in him he speaks in his diary of his “deadly encounter with the socalled charities” “i was endeavouring” he says “to uphold the reality of truth and justice against their superficial and flimsy appearances” “spoke from 510 to 820 with all my might such as it was” this speech with its fierce cogency and trenchant reasoning was counted by good judges who heard it to be among the two or three most powerful that he ever made and even today it may be read with the same sort of interest as we give to turgot’s famous disquisition on foundations it turns a rude searchlight upon illusions about charity that are all the more painful to dispel because they often spring from pity and from sympathy not the commonest of human elements it affects the jurist the economist the moralist the politician the house was profoundly impressed by both the argument and the performance but the clamour was too loud all the idols of marketplace and tribe were marched out in high parade and the proposal at last was dropped  m24 though the idea of putting a tax on the income of charitable endowments was rejected the budget of 1863 was the record of a triumph that was complete the american civil war by arresting the supply of cotton had half ruined lancashire the same cause had diminished the export trade to america by six millions sterling three bad seasons spoiled the crops there was distress in ireland yet the chancellor had a revenue in excess of expenditure by the noble figure of three millions and three quarters mr gladstone naturally took the opportunity of surveying the effects of four years of his financial policy he admitted that they had been four years of tension and this tension had been enhanced by his large remissions of duty and by taking in hand the completion of the great work of commercial legislation the end of it all was a growth of wealth as he called it almost intoxicating the value of british goods sent to france had risen from four millions and three quarters to nearly nine millions and one quarter in other words had about doubled under the operations of the treaty of commerce45 if to this were added foreign and colonial produce sent through us and acquired by us in exchange for our own produce the value had risen from nine and a half in 1859 to twentyone and three quarters in 1862 in mr gladstone’s own description later the export trade of 1860 in spite of a bad harvest was so stimulated by the liberating customs act that it rose at once from a hundred and thirty millions to a hundred and thirtyfive the next year it fell to a hundred and twentyfive and in 1862 it fell by another million owing to the withdrawal by reason of the american war of the material of our greatest manufacture in 1866 it rose to a hundred and eightyeight millions46 then under the head of incometax and comparing 1842 with 1862 over the same area and with the same limitations the aggregate amount of assessed income had risen from one hundred and fiftysix millions to two hundred and twentyone other tests and figures need not detain us       april 16 1863—my statement lasted three hours and this with a     good deal of compression it wound up i hope a chapter in     finance and in my life thanks to god 17—the usual sense of     relaxation after an effort i am oppressed too with a feeling of     deep unworthiness inability to answer my vocation and the desire     of rest 18—to windsor had an audience of the queen so warm     about sir g lewis and she warned me not to overwork   lewis had died five days before april 13 and this is mr gladstone’s entry—       april 14—reached cht at 1114 and was met by the sad news     of the death of sir george lewis i am pained to think of my     differences with him at one time on finance however he took     benefit by them rather than otherwise a most able most learned     most unselfish and most genial man   to sir gilbert lewis he wrote april 18—       like several eminent public men of our time he had many qualities     for which the outer world did not perhaps though it may not have     denied them ever give him full positive credit for example his     singular courtesy and careful attention to others in all     transactions great and small his thoroughly warm and most     forthcoming and genial disposition his almost unconsciousness of     the vast stores of his mind and of the great facility and     marvellous precision with which he used them and if i may so     say the noble and antique simplicity of character which he united     with such knowledge of men and of affairs   the final budget of this most remarkable series was that of 1866 when he swept away the last of the old vexatious duties on timber it contained another element as to which as i have said some thought he had not been keen enough in the budget of 1866 he first started the scheme of a sinking fund which when amplified and particularly when simplified by his successors did so much to reduce the dead weight of debt47 the complication of his scheme was due to his desire to make sure of its stability and undoubtedly he would have carried it if he had remained in office through the session he is however entitled to credit for laying the foundation of an effective sinking fund  one word more may be added on mr gladstone as financier he was far too comprehensive in his outlook to suppose that the great outburst of material prosperity during the years in which he controlled the exchequer and guided parliament in affairs of money was wholly and without qualification due to budgets alone to insist on ascribing complex results to single causes is the wellknown vice of narrow and untrained minds he was quite alive to the effects of “the enormous constant rapid and diversified development of mechanical power and the consequent saving of labour by the extension of machinery” he was well aware of the share of new means of locomotion in the growth of industrial enterprise but the special cause of what was most peculiar to england in the experience of this period he considered to be the wise legislation of parliament in seeking every opportunity for abolishing restrictions upon the application of capital and the exercise of industry and skill in this wise legislation his own energetic and beneficent genius played the master part     chapter v american civil war 18611863       then came the outbreak which had been so often foretold so often     menaced and the ground reeled under the nation during four years     of agony until at last after the smoke of the battlefield had     cleared away the horrid shape which had cast its shadow over a     whole continent had vanished and was gone for ever—john bright    i   sir cornewall lewis in a memorandum printed for the use of his colleagues both truly and impressively described the momentous struggle that at this time broke upon the family of civilised nations in both hemispheres “it may be fairly asserted” says the particularly competent writer of it “that the war in america is the greatest event that has occurred in the political world since the definitive fall of napoleon in 1815 the expulsion of the elder branch of the bourbons in 1830 the expulsion of louis philippe in 1848 the reestablishment of a republic and the subsequent restoration of a bonaparte to the imperial throne—were all important events both to france and to the rest of europe but with the exception of the recent annexation of savoy and nice they have not altered the boundaries of france and europe still in spite of minor changes substantially retains the form impressed upon it by the treaty of vienna48 with respect to the internal consequences of these changes a french revolution has become a fight in the streets of paris in order to determine who shall be the occupant of the tuileries the administrative body and the army—the two great governing powers of france—remain substantially unaffected whereas the american civil war threatens a complete territorial rearrangement of the union it also portends a fundamental change in the constitution by which both its federal and state elements will be recast”  of this immense conflict mr gladstone like most of the leading statesmen of the time and like the majority of his countrymen failed to take the true measure the error that lay at the root of our english misconception of the american struggle is now clear we applied ordinary political maxims to what was not merely a political contest but a social revolution without scrutiny of the cardinal realities beneath we discussed it like some superficial conflict in our old world about boundaries successions territorial partitions dynastic preponderance the significance of the american war was its relation to slavery that war arose from the economic social and political consequences that flowed from slavery—its wasteful cultivation the consequent need for extension of slave territory the probable revival of the accursed african trade the constitution of slaveholders as the sole depositaries of social prestige and political power secession was undertaken for the purpose of erecting into an independent state a community whose whole structure was moulded on a system that held labour in contempt that kept the labourer in ignorance and cruel bondage that demanded a vigilant censorship of the press and an army of watchmen and spies and this barbaric state was to set itself up on the border of a great nation founded on free industry political equality diffused knowledge energetic progress such was the meaning of secession “the rebellion” as charles sumner well said to mr gladstone in 1864 “is slavery in arms revolting indecent imperious” therefore those who fought against secession fought against slavery and all that was involved in that dark burden and whatever their motives may at different times have been they rendered an immortal service to humanity49  m25 at a very early period mr gladstone formed the opinion that the attempt to restore the union by force would and must fail “as far as the controversy between north and south” he wrote to the duchess of sutherland may 29 1861 “is a controversy on the principle announced by the vicepresident of the south viz that which asserts the superiority of the white man and therewith founds on it his right to hold the black in slavery i think that principle detestable and i am wholly with the opponents of it no distinction can in my eyes be broader than the distinction between the question whether the southern ideas of slavery are right and the question whether they can justifiably be put down by war from the north” to cyrus field he wrote nov 27 1862 “your frightful conflict may be regarded from many points of view the competency of the southern states to secede the rightfulness of their conduct in seceding two matters wholly distinct and a great deal too much confounded the natural reluctance of northern americans to acquiesce in the severance of the union and the apparent loss of strength and glory to their country the bearing of the separation on the real interests and on the moral character of the north again for an englishman its bearing with respect to british interests—all these are texts of which any one affords ample matter for reflection but i will only state as regards the last of them that i for one have never hesitated to maintain that in my opinion the separate and special interests of england were all on the side of the maintenance of the old union and if i were to look at those interests alone and had the power of choosing in what way the war should end i would choose for its ending by the restoration of the old union this very day”  in a letter to the duchess of sutherland nov 7 1862 he says “a friendly correspondent writes to say he is sorry the south has my sympathies but the south has not my sympathies except in the sense in which the north has them also i wish them both cordially well which i believe is more than most englishmen can at present say with truth in both i see the elements of future power and good in both i see also the elements of danger and mischief’ to another correspondent ’i have never to my knowledge expressed any sympathy with the southern cause in any speech at newcastle or elsewhere nor have i passed any eulogium upon president davis in dealing whether with south or north i have thought it out of my province to touch in any way the complicated question of praise and blame”  at a very early stage the duke of argyll sent him some letter of mrs beecher stowe’s and mr gladstone in acknowledging it from penmaenmawr aug 26 1861 writes expressing all possible respect for her character and talents but thinks that she has lost intellectual integrity—       it seems to me that the south has two objects in view firstly the     liberation of its trade and people from the law of tribute to the     north secondly and perhaps mainly the maintenance of the slave     system without fear or risk of northern interference that on the     other hand it is very difficult to analyse that movement of the     north which mrs stowe finds sublime but which in my eyes is     tumultuous there is the antislavery motive impelling with great     vehemence a small section which she rather offensively calls the     christian people of the union there is the spirit of protection     and monopoly unwilling to surrender future booty there is the     unquietness in the great towns found in america as in all     countries and ever ready for a row there is the fear which mr     motley described that unless a firm front were shown against     secession it would not stop where it had begun there is last and     relatively to this subject matter best of all the strong     instinct of national life and the abhorrence of nature itself     towards all severance of an organised body this last sentiment     as well as the first deserved to be treated by us with great     tenderness and respect as to the authority and title of the     north it must be granted primâ facie but on examination it is     subject to a good deal of doubt and i think it seems to have been     the intention of the framers of the constitution not to lay down a     rule for the solution of a great question of this kind but to     leave it open and if so i think they were wise for such a     question could only arise for any practical purpose at a time when     the foundations of the great social deep are broken up and when     the forces brought into unrestrained play are by far too gigantic     to be controlled by paper conventions   so much for his view of the case in its general aspect    ii   at one dangerous moment in the conflict it seemed possible that great britain might be forced to take a part the commander of an american manofwar boarded the trent nov 8 1861 a british mailboat seized two emissaries from the southern confederacy on their way to europe and carried them off to his own ship whence they were afterwards landed and thrown into prison this act was in direct violation of those rights of neutrals of which the united states hitherto had been the strictest champion against great britain and nothing was to be gained by it for the presence of the two commissioners was not in the least likely to effect any change in the policy of either england or france violent explosions of public feeling broke out on both sides of the atlantic of anger in england of exultation in america mr gladstone’s movements at this critical hour are interesting on nov 27 says phillimore “gladstones dined here gladstone with the account in his pocket from the evening papers of the capture of the southern envoys out of the english mailship” the next two nights he was at court       nov 28—off at 630 to windsor the queen and prince spoke much     of the american news      nov 29 friday—came up to town for the cabinet on american     news returned to windsor for dinner and reported to queen and     prince   of this important cabinet mr gladstone wrote an account to the duke of argyll then absent from london—       dec 3 ’61—the cabinet determined on friday to ask reparation     and on saturday they agreed to two despatches to lord lyons of     which the one recited the facts stated we could not but suppose     the american government would of itself be desirous to afford us     reparation and said that in any case we must have 1 the     commissioners returned to british protection and 2 an apology     or expression of regret the second of these despatches desired     lyons to come away within seven days if the demands are not     complied with i thought and urged that we should hear what the     americans had to say before withdrawing lyons for i could not     feel sure that we were at the bottom of the law of the case or     could judge here and now what form it would assume but this view     did not prevail   we may assume that mr gladstone in reporting these proceedings at windsor did not conceal his own arguments for moderation which had been overruled on the following day the cabinet again met “nov 30 sat left windsor at 1125 cabinet 35½ lord russell’s draft softened and abridged” that is to say the draft was brought nearer though not near enough to the temper urged upon the cabinet and represented at court by mr gladstone the day before  the story of the first of these two critical despatches is pretty well known how the draft initialled by lord russell was sent down the same night to windsor how the prince consort—then as it proved rapidly sinking down into his fatal illness—found it somewhat meagre and suggested modifications and simplifications how the queen returned the draft with the suggestions in a letter to the prime minister how palmerston thought them excellent and after remodelling the draft in the more temperate spirit recommended by the prince though dropping at least one irritating phrase in the queen’s memorandum50 sent it back to the foreign office whence it was duly sent on dec 1 to lord lyons at washington it seems moreover that a day’s reflection had brought his colleagues round to mr gladstone’s mind for lord russell wrote to lord lyons a private note dec 1 in effect instructing him to say nothing about withdrawing in seven days51  m26 the british despatches were delivered to lord lyons at washington at midnight on december 18 the reparation despatch was formally read to mr seward on the 23rd and on christmas day lincoln had a meeting of his cabinet sumner was invited to attend and he read long letters from cobden and bright “at all hazards” said bright “you must not let this matter grow to a war with england even if you are right and we are wrong war will be fatal to your idea of restoring the union i implore you not on any feeling that nothing can be conceded and that england is arrogant and seeking a quarrel to play the game of every enemy of your country”52 a french despatch in the english sense was also read seward and sumner were in favour of giving up the men the president thinking of popular excitement hesitated in the end partly because the case was bad on the merits partly because they could not afford to have a second great war upon their hands all came round to seward’s view53    iii   by the autumn of 1862 the war had lasted a year and a half it was already entailing a cost heavier than our war with napoleon at its most expensive period the north had still failed to execute its declared purpose of reducing the south to submission the blockade of the southern ports by stopping the export of cotton was declared to have produced worse privations loss and suffering to england and france than were ever produced to neutral nations by a war it was not in mr gladstone’s nature to sit with folded hands in sight of what he took to be hideous and unavailing carnage and havoc lord palmerston he tells mrs gladstone july 29 1862 “has come exactly to my mind about some early representation of a friendly kind to america if we can get france and russia to join” a day or two later aug 3 he writes to the duke of argyll “my opinion is that it is vain and wholly unsustained by precedent to say nothing shall be done until both parties are desirous of it that however we ought to avoid sole action or anything except acting in such a combination as would morally represent the weight of impartial europe that with this view we ought to communicate with france and russia to make with them a friendly representation if they are ready to do it of the mischief and the hopelessness of prolonging the contest in which both sides have made extraordinary and heroic efforts but if they are not ready then to wait for some opportunity when they may be disposed to move with us the adhesion of other powers would be desirable if it does not encumber the movement”  “in the year 1862” says mr gladstone in a fragment of autobiography “i had emerged from very grave financial budget difficulties which in 1860 and 1861 went near to breaking me down a blue sky was now above me and some of the northern liberals devised for me a triumphant visit to the tyne which of course entailed as one of its incidents a public dinner” seeing a visit to newcastle announced lord palmerston wrote sept 24 to mr gladstone begging him on no account to let the chancellor of the exchequer be too sympathetic with the taxpayer or to tell the country that it was spending more money than it could afford a more important part of the letter was to inform mr gladstone that he himself and lord russell thought the time was fast approaching when an offer of mediation ought to be made by england france and russia and that russell was going privately to instruct the ambassador at paris to sound the french government “of course” lord palmerston said “no actual step would be taken without the sanction of the cabinet but if i am not mistaken you would be inclined to approve such a course” the proposal would be made to both north and south if both should accept an armistice would follow and negotiations on the basis of separation if both should decline then lord palmerston assumed that they would acknowledge the independence of the south the next day mr gladstone replied he was glad to learn what the prime minister had told him and for two reasons especially he desired that the proceedings should be prompt the first was the rapid progress of the southern arms and the extension of the area of southern feeling the second was the risk of violent impatience in the cottontowns of lancashire such as would prejudice the dignity and disinterestedness of the proffered mediation54 on september 17 russell had replied to a letter from palmerston three days earlier saying explicitly “i agree with you that the time is come for offering mediation to the united states government with a view to the recognition of the independence of the confederates i agree further that in case of failure we ought ourselves to recognise the southern states as an independent state”55 so far then had the two heads of the government advanced when mr gladstone went to newcastle  m27 the people of the tyne gave him the reception of a king the prints of the time tell how the bells rang guns thundered a great procession of steamers followed him to the mouth of the river ships flew their gayest bunting the banks were thronged with hosts of the blackhanded toilers of the forges the furnaces the coalstaiths chemical works glass factories shipyards eager to catch a glimpse of the great man and all this not because he had tripled the exports to france but because a sure instinct had revealed an accent in his eloquence that spoke of feeling for the common people56       oct 7 1862—reflected further on what i should say about     lancashire and america for both these subjects are critical     at two we went to newcastle and saw the principal objects     including especially the fine church and lantern the gem of an     old castle and grey street—i think our best modern street the     photographer also laid hands on me at six we went to a crowded     and enthusiastic dinner of near 500 i was obliged to make a long     oration which was admirably borne the hall is not very easy to     fill with the voice but quite practicable 8—reached gateshead     at 12 and after an address and reply embarked in the midst of a     most striking scene which was prolonged and heightened as we went     down the river at the head of a fleet of some 25 steamers amidst     the roar of guns and the banks lined or dotted above and below     with multitudes of people the expedition lasted six hours and i     had as many speeches as hours such a pomp i shall probably never     again witness circumstances have brought upon me what i do not in     any way deserve the spectacle was really one for turner no     one else 9—off to sunderland here we had a similar reception     and a progress through the town and over the docks and harbour     works i had to address the naval men and then came a large     meeting in the hall thence by rail to middlesborough at     darlington we were met by lord zetland the mayor and others     middlesborough was as warm or even warmer another progress and     steamboat procession and incessant flood of information respecting     this curious place the labour however is too much giddiness     came over me for a moment while i spoke at sunderland and i had     to take hold of the table at middlesborough we had an address and     reply in the town hall then a public dinner and we ended a day     of over fifteen hours at upleatham before midnight c again     holding out and indeed she is a great part of the whole business     with the people everywhere i ought to be thankful still more     ought i to be ashamed it was vain to think of reading writing     or much reflecting on such a day i was most happy to lie down for     fifteen minutes at mr vaughan’s in middlesborough 11—off at 8     am to take the rail at guisbro at middlesborough many friends     had gathered at the station to give us a parting cheer we came on     to york went at once to the mansionhouse and then visited the     minister at two came the “luncheon” and i had to address another     kind of audience   unhappily the slave must still go in the triumphal car to remind us of the fallibilities of men and here the conqueror made a grave mistake at the banquet in the town hall of newcastle oct 7 with which all these joyous proceedings had begun mr gladstone let fall a sentence about the american war of which he was destined never to hear the last “we know quite well that the people of the northern states have not yet drunk of the cup—they are still trying to hold it far from their lips—which all the rest of the world see they nevertheless must drink of we may have our own opinions about slavery we may be for or against the south but there is no doubt that jefferson davis and other leaders of the south have made an army they are making it appears a navy and they have made what is more than either they have made a nation”  here the speaker was forgetful of a wholesome saying of his own that “a man who speaks in public ought to know besides his own meaning the meaning which others will attach to his words” the sensation was immediate and profound all the world took so pointed an utterance to mean that the government were about to recognise the independence of the south the cotton men were thrown into a position of doubt and uncertainty that still further disturbed their trade orders for cotton were countermanded and the supply of the precious material for a moment threatened to become worse than ever cobden and bright were twitted with the lapse of their favourite from a central article of their own creed and commandments louis blanc then in exile here describing the feeling of the country compares the sympathy for the north to a dam and the sympathy for the south to a torrent and says he fears that gladstone at newcastle had yielded to the temptation of courting popularity57 the american minister dropped a hint about passports58  to the numerous correspondents who complained of his language mr gladstone framed a form of reply disclaiming responsibility for all the various inferences that people chose to draw from his language “and generally” his secretary concluded in phrases that justly provoked plain men to wrath “mr gladstone desires me to remark that to form opinions upon questions of policy to announce them to the world and to take or to be a party to taking any of the steps necessary for giving them effect are matters which though connected together are in themselves distinct and which may be separated by intervals of time longer or shorter according to the particular circumstances of the case”59 mr gladstone sent a copy of this enigmatical response to the foreign secretary who was far too acute not to perceive all the mischief and the peril but had his full share of that generosity of our public life that prevents a minister from bearing too hardly on a colleague who has got the boat and its crew into a scrape lord russell replied from walmer oct 20 “i have forwarded to your private secretary your very proper answer to your very impertinent correspondent still you must allow me to say that i think you went beyond the latitude which all speakers must be allowed when you said that jeff davis had made a nation recognition would seem to follow and for that step i think the cabinet is not prepared however we shall soon meet to discuss this very topic” a week after the deliverance at newcastle lewis at lord palmerston’s request as i have heard put things right in a speech at hereford the southern states he said had not de facto established their independence and were not entitled to recognition on any accepted principles of public law  m28 it is superfluous for any of us at this day to pass judgment mr gladstone has left on record in a fragmentary note of late date his own estimate of an error that was in truth serious enough and that has since been most of all exaggerated by those sections of society and opinion who at the time most eagerly and freely shared the very same delusion       i have yet to record he writes july 1896 in the fragment     already more than once mentioned an undoubted error the most     singular and palpable i may add the least excusable of them all     especially since it was committed so late as in the year 1862     when i had outlived half a century in the autumn of that year     and in a speech delivered after a public dinner at     newcastleupontyne i declared in the heat of the american     struggle that jefferson davis had made a nation that is to say     that the division of the american republic by the establishment of     a southern or secession state was an accomplished fact strange to     say this declaration most unwarrantable to be made by a minister     of the crown with no authority other than his own was not due to     any feeling of partizanship for the south or hostility to the     north the fortunes of the south were at their zenith many who     wished well to the northern cause despaired of its success the     friends of the north in england were beginning to advise that it     should give way for the avoidance of further bloodshed and     greater calamity i weakly supposed that the time had come when     respectful suggestions of this kind founded on the necessity of     the case were required by a spirit of that friendship which in     so many contingencies of life has to offer sound recommendations     with a knowledge that they will not be popular not only was this     a misjudgment of the case but even if it had been otherwise i     was not the person to make the declaration i really though most     strangely believed that it was an act of friendliness to all     america to recognise that the struggle was virtually at an end i     was not one of those who on the ground of british interests     desired a division of the american union my view was distinctly     opposite i thought that while the union continued it never could     exercise any dangerous pressure upon canada to estrange it from     the empire—our honour as i thought rather than our interest     forbidding its surrender but were the union split the north no     longer checked by the jealousies of slavepower would seek a     partial compensation for its loss in annexing or trying to annex     british north america lord palmerston desired the severance as a     diminution of a dangerous power but prudently held his tongue      that my opinion was founded upon a false estimate of the facts was     the very least part of my fault i did not perceive the gross     impropriety of such an utterance from a cabinet minister of a     power allied in blood and language and bound to loyal neutrality     the case being further exaggerated by the fact that we were     already so to speak under indictment before the world for not     as was alleged having strictly enforced the laws of neutrality     in the matter of the cruisers my offence was indeed only a     mistake but one of incredible grossness and with such     consequences of offence and alarm attached to it that my failing     to perceive them justly exposed me to very severe blame it     illustrates vividly that incapacity which my mind so long     retained and perhaps still exhibits an incapacity of viewing     subjects all round in their extraneous as well as in their     internal properties and thereby of knowing when to be silent and     when to speak      i am the more pained and grieved because i have for the last     fiveandtwenty years received from the government and people of     america tokens of goodwill which could not fail to arouse my     undying gratitude when we came to the arbitration at geneva my     words were cited as part of the proof of hostile animus     meantime i had prepared a lengthened statement to show from my     abundant declarations on other occasions that there was and could     be on my part no such animus i was desirous to present this     statement to the arbitrators my colleagues objected so largely to     the proceeding that i desisted in this i think they probably were     wrong i addressed my paper to the american minister for the     information of his government and mr secretary fish gave me so     far as intention was concerned a very handsome acquittal      and strange to saypost hoc though perhaps not propter hoc     the united states have been that country of the world in which the     most signal marks of public honour have been paid me and in which     my name has been the most popular the only parallels being italy     greece and the balkan peninsula   among the many calumnies poured upon him in this connection was the charge that he had been a subscriber to the confederate loan “the statement” he wrote to a correspondent oct 17 1865 “is not only untrue but it is so entirely void of the slightest shadow of support in any imaginable incident of the case that i am hardly able to ascribe it to mere error and am painfully perplexed as to the motives which could have prompted so mischievous a forgery”    iv   as i have already said the american minister had hinted at passports ten days after mr gladstone’s speech mr adams saw lord russell having mentioned some minor matters he came to the real object of the interview “if i had trusted” he said “to the construction given by the public to a late speech i should have begun to think of packing my carpet bag and trunks his lordship at once embraced the allusion and whilst endeavouring to excuse mr gladstone in fact admitted that his act had been regretted by lord palmerston and the other cabinet officers still he could not disavow the sentiments of mr gladstone so far as he understood them his meaning was not that ascribed to him by the public mr gladstone was himself willing to disclaim that he had written to that effect to lord palmerston his lordship said that the policy of the government was to adhere to a strict neutrality and to leave this struggle to settle itself i asked him if i was to understand that policy as not now to be changed he said yes”60  if this relation be accurate then the foreign secretary did not construe strict neutrality as excluding what diplomatists call good offices on october 13 lord russell circulated a memorandum to the cabinet setting out in an argumentative tone all the adverse and confused aspects of the situation and outlook in america and ending in the emphatic conclusion that it had now become a question for the great powers of europe whether it was not their duty to ask both parties to agree to a suspension of arms for the purpose of weighing calmly the advantages of peace cornewall lewis oct 17 while expressing an opinion that a peaceful separation between north and south would in the end have been best for the north and while apparently believing that the war must one day end in southern independence met russell’s suggestion by cogent arguments against action on our part61 a week later oct 24 mr gladstone circulated a rejoinder to lewis arguing for representation to the two combatants from england france and russia—a representation with moral authority and force of the opinion of the civilised world upon the conditions of the case  m29 this pretty nearly concludes all that need be said upon the attitude taken by mr gladstone in that mighty struggle we may at least add that if and where it differed from that of the majority of his countrymen it did not differ for the worse in november 1862 the french emperor renewed proposals of joint mediation the emperor had objects of his own to serve he was entangled in the coils of the mexican adventure that was to give the first shock to his throne and to add another to the long scroll of tragedies in the house of hapsburg from the first the government of the american union had scowled upon the intervention of europe in the affairs of mexico just as the same government had refused to intervene in a european protest on behalf of poland the civil war between north and south kept american hands tied and napoleon well knew that the success of the north and the consolidation of the union would overthrow his designs in mexico he cast restlessly about for any combination that promised aid to the southern confederates who whether they should emerge strong or weak from the struggle would be a useful instrument for his future purposes so now he pressed england and russia to join him in a project of mediation russia declined the london cabinet was divided62 mr gladstone writes home in these important days—“nov 11 we have had our cabinet today and meet again tomorrow i am afraid we shall do little or nothing in the business of america but i will send you definite intelligence both lords palmerston and russell are right—nov 12 the united states affair has ended and not well lord russell rather turned tail he gave way without resolutely fighting out his battle however though we decline for the moment the answer is put upon grounds and in terms which leave the matter very open for the future—nov 13 i think the french will make our answer about america public at least it is very possible but i hope they may not take it as a positive refusal or at any rate that they may themselves act in the matter it will be clear that we concur with them that the war should cease palmerston gave to russell’s proposal a feeble and halfhearted support as to the state of matters generally in the cabinet i have never seen it smoother and they look pretty well i think as regards my department though the distress tells upon me”  the only speech i believe delivered by mr gladstone upon the war in parliament while resisting the motion for the recognition of the confederacy was curiously balanced63 as to the south he said not a few must sympathise with a resistance as heroic as ever was offered in the history of the world on the part of a weaker body against the overpowering forces of a stronger on the other hand the cause of the south was so connected with slavery that a strong countercurrent of feeling must arise in the mind then again it is impossible for any englishman not to have a very strong feeling of sympathy with those in the north who saw exalted visions of the great future of their country now threatened with destruction he had never agreed with those who thought it a matter of high british interest that the old american union should be torn in pieces he had always thought that involved as england was both in interest and in duty and honour with canada the balanced state of the american union which caused the whole of american politics to turn on the relative strength of the slavery and northern interests was more favourable to our colonial relations in north america than if the said union were to be divided into a cluster of northern and a cluster of southern states the north would endeavour to reestablish their territorial grandeur by seeking union with the british possessions in north america he dwelt upon the horrid incidents of war he insisted once more that the public opinion of this country was unanimous that the restoration of the american union by force was unattainable some cries of “no” greeted this declaration about unanimity but he would not qualify it further than to say that at any rate it was almost unanimous the other chief speakers that night were mr forster who played a brave and clearsighted part throughout lord robert cecil who attacked the “vague and loose” arguments of the chancellor of the exchequer and mr bright who made perhaps the most powerful and the noblest speech of his life     chapter vi death of friends—days at balmoral 18611884       itaque veræ amicitiæ difficillime reperiuntur in iis qui in     honoribus reque publica versantur—cicero      true friendships are hard to find among men who busy themselves     about politics and office    i   within a few months of one another three of mr gladstone’s closest friends and allies were lost to him lord aberdeen died at the end of 1860 the letter written by mr gladstone to the son of his veteran chief is long but it deserves reproduction64 as a writer though an alert and most strenuous disputant he was apt to be diffuse and abstract partly these defects were due to the subjects with which in his literary performances he mostly chose to deal perhaps one secret was that he forgot the famous word of quintilian that the way to write well is not to write quickly but if you take trouble to write well in time you can write as quickly as you like65 his character of lord aberdeen like his beautiful letter in a similar vein about hopescott66 where also his feelings were deeply moved is very different from his more formal manner and may claim high place among our literary portraits it is penetrating in analysis admirable in diction rich in experience of life and human nature and truly inspiring in those noble moralities that are the lifeblood of style and of greater things than mere style can ever be  then in the autumn of 1861 both graham and sidney herbert died the former the most esteemed and valued of all his counsellors the latter so prematurely cut off “that beautiful and sunny spirit” as he called him perhaps the best beloved of all his friends “called on gladstone” says phillimore on this last occasion aug 3 “found him at breakfast alone very glad to see me his eyes filled with tears all the time he spoke to me in a broken voice about his departed friend the effect upon him has been very striking increased no doubt by recent political differences of opinion” “it is difficult to speak of herbert” mr gladstone said later “because with that singular harmony and singular variety of gifts—every gift of person every gift of position every gift of character with which it pleased providence to bless him—he was one of whom we may well recite words that the great poet of this country has applied to a prince of our early history cut off by death earlier than his countrymen would have desired—       “a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman     framed in the prodigality of nature     the spacious world cannot again afford”67   the void thus left was never filled of graham he wrote to the duchess of sutherland—       oct 26—this most sad and unexpected news from netherby rises     up between me and your letter i have lost a friend whom i seem to     appreciate the more because the world appreciated him so     inadequately his intellectual force could not be denied but i     have never known a person who had such signal virtues that were so     little understood the remainder of my political career be it what     it may and i trust not over long will be passed in the house of     commons without one old friend who is both political and     personal this is the gradual withdrawal of the props preparing     for what is to follow let me not however seem to complain for     never i believe was any one blessed so entirely beyond his     deserts in the especial and capital article of friendships   not many months later june 1862 he had to write to mr gordon “we are all sorely smitten by canning’s death” whose fame he said would “bear the scrutinising judgment of posterity under whose keen eye so many illusions are doomed to fade away”68  m30 in the december of 1861 died the prince consort his last communication to mr gladstone was a letter nov 19 proposing to recommend him as an elder brother of the trinity house in place of graham of mr gladstone’s first interview with the queen after her bereavement dean wellesley wrote to him that she was greatly touched by his evidence of sympathy “she saw how much you felt for her and the mind of a person in such deep affliction is keenly sensitive and observant of all her ministers she seemed to me to think that you had most entered into her sorrows and she dwelt especially upon the manner in which you had parted from her” to the duchess of sutherland mr gladstone writes—       march 20 1862—i find i must go out at four exactly in any     case i do not like to trust to chance your knowing or not knowing     what befell me yesterday your advice was excellent i was really     bewildered but that all vanished when the queen came in and kept     my hand a moment all was beautiful simple noble touching to     the very last degree it was a meeting for me to be remembered     i need only report the first and last words of the personal part     of the conversation the first after a quarter of an hour upon     affairs was putting down her head and struggling “the nation     has been very good to me in my time of sorrow” and the last “i     earnestly pray it may be long before you are parted from one     another”69   in the spring he took occasion at manchester to pronounce a fine panegyric on the prince70 for which the queen thanked him in a letter of passionate desolation too sacred in the anguish of its emotion to be printed here “every source of interest or pleasure” she concludes “causes now the acutest pain mrs gladstone who the queen knows is a most tender wife may in a faint manner picture to herself what the queen suffers” mr gladstone replies—       it may not be impertinent in him to assure your majesty that all     the words to which your majesty refers were received with deep     emotion by the whole of a very large assembly who appeared to     feel both your majesty’s too conspicuous affliction and the     solemnity of its relation to the severe and alas darkening     circumstances of the district71      in presuming to touch upon that relation and in following the     direction which his subject gave him towards very sacred ground     he was especially desirous to avoid using even a phrase or a word     of exaggeration and likewise to speak only as one who had seen     your majesty’s great sorrow in no other way than as all your     majesty’s subjects beheld it      in speaking thus he knew that he must fall short of the truth and     indeed even were it becoming to make the attempt he would in     vain labour to convey the impression made upon his mind by the     interview to which he was admitted at windsor and by the letter     now in his hands   more follows in the vein and on the topics that are usual in letters of mourning sympathy and the effect was what the writer sought from balmoral came a note may 6 1862 “the queen wishes princess alice to thank mr gladstone in her name for the kind letter he wrote to her the other day which did her aching heart good kind words soothe but nothing can lessen or alleviate the weight of sorrow she has to bear”  many years later he sat down to place on record his thoughts about the prince consort but did not proceed beyond a scanty fragment which i will here transcribe—       my praise will be impartial for he did not fascinate or command     or attract me through any medium but that of judgment and     conscience there was i think a want of freedom nature and     movement in his demeanour due partly to a faculty and habit of     reflection that never intermitted partly to an inexorable     watchfulness over all he did and said which produced something     that was related to stillness and dullness in a manner which was     notwithstanding invariably modest frank and kind even to one     who had no claims upon him for the particular exhibition of such     qualities perhaps i had better first disburden myself of what i     have to set down against him i do not think he was a man without     prejudices and this particularly in religion his views of the     church of rome must i think have been illiberal at any rate i     well remember a conversation with him at windsor respecting the     papal decree imposing the belief in the immaculate conception     somewhere about the time when it came forth he said he was glad     of it as it would tend to expose and explode the whole system i     contended with a freedom which he always seemed to encourage     that we all had an interest in the well being and well doing     absolute or relative of that great christian communion and that     whatever indicated or increased the predominance of the worse     influences within her pale over the better was a thing we ought     much to deplore no assent even qualified was to be got72   the death of the prince consort was a greater personal calamity to mr gladstone than he could then foresee perhaps the disadvantage was almost as real as the death of the consort of king george ii to sir robert walpole much as they might differ in political and religious opinion yet in seriousness conscience and laborious temperament the prince and he were in exact accord and it is impossible to doubt that if the prince had survived at the queen’s right hand certain jars might have been avoided that made many difficulties for the minister in later times    ii   i may as well here gather into a chapter some short pieces mainly from letters to mrs gladstone during the period covered by this fifth book the most interesting of them perhaps are the little pictures of his life as minister in attendance at balmoral but there are besides two or three hints of a simplicity in his faculty of enjoyment in regions outside of graver things that may shock critics of more complex or fastidious judgment readers will benevolently take them all as they come he made a curious entry in his diary upon his birthday at the end of 1860 “’dec 29 began my fiftysecond year i cannot believe it i feel within me the rebellious unspoken word i will not be old the horizon enlarges the sky shifts around me it is an age of shocks a discipline so strong so manifold so rapid and whirling that only when it is at an end if then can i hope to comprehend it” yet nearly all the most conspicuous scenes still lay before him       october 18 1860—i did not get to the play last night from     finding the woman in white so very interesting it has no dull     parts and is far better sustained than adam bede though i do     not know if it rises quite as high the character drawing is     excellent      downing street dec 15—the chancellor says keep this from     view that prince albert said to him at windsor “we germans have     no boundaries our only boundary is the quadrilateral” ie     fortress in the heart of italy this i fear must be true and     if so is sad enough because he evidently spoke his mind out     unsuspiciously      dec 18—i actually went last night five mortal miles to hoxton     to see “eily o’connor” the colleen bawn in another shape it was     not without interest though very inferior and imitated in some     cases with a ludicrous closeness the theatre is a poor working     man’s theatre i paid 1s for a very aristocratic place tonight     i am going with phillimore to the westminster play a latin one     which i am afraid is rather long      jan 18 1861—i write a few lines to you in the train near     harrow we shall not be in till four all safe and immense care     evidently taken on account of the frost though i do not feel it     much in the air i have had other matters to keep me warm among     the letters given me this morning at hawarden was one from lord     john in which he quietly informs me that since the cabinet     separated he has agreed to guarantee a loan and for morocco     this i mean to resist and have managed to write a letter in the     carriage to tell him so what will come of it i do not know it     is a very serious affair i am afraid he has committed himself     egregiously i am very bad now but what shall i be at     sixtyeight      jan 19—indeed this is a strange world yesterday it seemed     lord j russell might go out or more likely i might or even the     cabinet might go to pieces today he writes to me that he     supposes he must find a way out of his proposal so that is over      jan 23—you seem to have taken great pains about stable     affairs and i am quite satisfied the truth indeed alas is i     am not fit at this critical time to give any thought to such     matters the embarrassment of our vast public expenditure     together with the ill effects of the bad harvest are so thick     upon me together with the arrangements for next year and the     preparation of my own bills for improvements which though a     laborious are a healthy and delightful part of my work      jan 24—i expect argyll to share my mutton tonight and we     shall i dare say have a comfortable talk last night i saw     herbert i think he looks much better he did not open the subject     of estimates nor did i before her but i told him what i am     sorry to say is true that the prospects of revenue grow much     worse up to a certain point i must certainly make a stand but i     think he is rather frightened about expenditure and not so     panicstricken about france so that we may come together      jan 25—i write from the cabinet i am in the midst of a deadly     struggle about the estimates the only comfort this year is that     i think the conflict will be more with the navy than the army     herbert has told me today with a simplicity and absence of     egotism which one could not but remark in his graceful character     the nature of his complaint you will quickly guess as to     cabinets lord john says we had better meet frequently and it     will be on tuesday if i am able to come down next week but this     is full of uncertainty i hear that the prince is wild about the     danish question      jan 26—another cabinet on monday it is just possible they may     relax after that day i have had two long days of hard fighting     by dint of what after all might be called threat of resignation     i have got the navy estimates a little down and i am now in the     battle about the army about the reduction in the navy palmerston     criticised lord john protested and cardwell i think went     farther than either never on any single occasion since this     government was formed has his voice been raised in the cabinet for     economy what a misfortune it is that herbert has no nerve to     speak out even in a private conversation he told me yesterday of     his reduction but did not tell me that more than half of it was     purely nominal the article in the quarterly is clever and what     it says moreover on the merits of the incometax is true i     suspect i might say i fear it is written by northcote      feb 5—yesterday in the carriage from kidderminster i heard     in part a dialogue of which i gathered so much first worthy     “i suppose we shall have to pay twopence or threepence more     incometax” second worthy “gladstone seems to be a totally     incompetent man” third “then he always wraps himself in such     mystery but now i do not see what else he can do he has cut away     the ground from under his feet”—with a growl about the     conservative party such is the public opinion of worcestershire     beyond all doubt      hawarden may 24—the house looks cleanliness itself and     altogether being down here in the fresh air and seeing nature all     round me so busy with her work so beneficent and beautiful makes     me very sick of london and its wrathful politics and wish that we     were all here or hereabouts once more      july 20—the political storm has blown over but i do not think     it seems an evening for riding to holly house nor can i honestly     say that a party there would be a relaxation for my weary bones     and wearier nerves and brain      aug 4—i have been at all saints this morning though london is     empty as they say it was absolutely crammed richards preached     an excellent sermon but i certainly should not wish to be an     habitual attendant there the intention of the service is most     devout but i am far from liking wholly the mode of execution my     neighbour in church whispered to me “is the bishop of london’s     jurisdiction acknowledged here” i think he seemed to wish it     should not be      oct 22—tell harry his son he is right latin is difficult     and it is in great part because it is difficult that it is useful     suppose lie wanted to make himself a good jumper how would he do     it by trying first indeed what was easy but after that     always what was difficult enough to make him exert himself to the     uttermost if he kept to the easy jumps he would never improve     but the jumps that are at first difficult by and bye become easy     so the latin lessons which he now finds difficult he will find     easy when once his mind has been improved and strengthened by     those very lessons see if he understands this      dec 29—the strangest feeling of all in me is a rebellion i     know not what else to call it against growing old      cliveden maidenhead jan 14 1862—i have written to john his     brother and if he is in town i shall go up and see him tomorrow     meantime i have mentioned locock as recommended by you i fear     the dark cloud is slowly gathering over him his wife’s illness     as we have seen it lately gather over so many and then break i am     amazed at the mercy of god towards us and towards me in     particular i think of all the children and of their health in     body and in mind it seems as if it could not last but this is     all in god’s hand      here are the argylls lady blantyre and a heap of young we have     been busy reading translations of homer this morning including     some of mine which are approved tennyson has written most noble     lines on the prince lord palmerston is reported well      jan 18—i lifted hayward last night back from dinner he is     full of the doctrine that lord palmerston is not to last another     year johnny is then to succeed and i to lead as he says by the     universal admission of the whigs in the h of c it is rather     hard before the death thus to divide the inheritance but that we     may not be too vain it is attended with this further     announcement that when that event occurs the government is     shortly to break down      cabinet room feb 1—the cabinet has gone well73 it is     rather amusing i am driving the screw lewis yields point by     point i think in substance the question is ruled in my favour     thank god for the prospect of peace but it will not positively be     settled till monday lewis’s last dying speech ’well we will see     what can be done’      bowden wilts feb 19—the funeral is over the wife of his     brother nothing could be better ordered in point of taste and     feeling it was one of the most touching i think the most     touching scene i ever witnessed when the six daughters weeping     profusely knelt around the grave and amidst their sobs and tears     just faltered out the petitions of the lord’s prayer in the     service john sensible of his duty of supporting others went     through it all with great fortitude on the whole i must say i     can wish no more for any family than that when the stroke of     bereavement comes they meet it as it has been met here      nov 18—i have sat an hour with lord lyndhurst he is much     older than when i saw him last but still has pith and life in     him as well as that astonishing freshness of mind which gives him     a charm in its way quite unrivalled he was very kind and what is     more he showed i think a seriousness of tone which has been     missed before      last night i saw “lord dundreary” i think it—the part and the     player not the play—quite admirable it is a thoroughly refined     piece of acting such as we hardly ever see in england and it     combines with refinement intense fun my face became with laughing     like what falstaff says he will make prince henry’s face “like a     wet cloak ill laid up”74 phillimore      windsor castle dec 10—here i am with six candles blazing of     which i shall put out a larger proportion when no longer afraid of     a visit from the great people about the passages i got your     letter this morning but i am amazed at your thinking i have the     pluck to ask the princess of wales or the queen about     photographs promised or not promised      in came the dean after that a summons to the queen with whom i     have been an hour she is well in health and in spirits and when     she speaks of the prince does it with a free natural and healthy     tone that is most pleasing i am to see the prince of wales after     dinner i now therefore make sure of leaving tomorrow the queen     asked kindly about you and i saw little princess beatrice    iii       aug 31 1863—walked 2434 miles found it rather too much for     my stiffening limbs my day of long stretches is i think gone     by      balmoral sept 26—this place is on the whole very beautiful     and satisfactory and deeside at large has lost for me none of its     charms with its blackgreen fir and grey rock and its boundless     ranges of heather still almost in full bloom the queen spends a     good many hours out and looks well but older i had a long     conversation or audience today but as regards the form and mode     of life here so far as i see it does not differ for visitors     from windsor all meals and rooms are separate but sometimes it     appears some are invited to dine with the queen the household     circle is smaller here than at windsor and so less formal and     dull i doubt your doctrine about your message but i will give it     if a good opportunity occurs she talked very pleasantly and well     upon many matters public and other—do not go on reading this     aloud or give it to others as to politics she talked most of     america and germany also some lancashire distress she feels an     immense interest in germany her recollections of the prince’s     sentiments being in that as in other matters a barometer to     govern her sympathies and affections she said when i hoped she     had received benefit from the air here that she thought she had     been better in germany than anywhere though it was excessively     hot she asked where i had been and about our living at hawarden     and where it was i told her i thought she had been there at     least driving through from eaton was it not so when she was     princess and at last she seemed to remember it and said it was     thirtyone years ago princess alice has got a black boy here who     was given to her and he produces a great sensation on the     deeside where the people never saw anything of the kind and     cannot conceive it a woman and an intelligent one cried out in     amazement on seeing him and said she would certainly have fallen     down but for the queen’s presence she said nothing would induce     her to wash his clothes as the black would come off this story     the queen told me in good spirits      she said that some people after heavy bereavement disliked seeing     those whom they had known well before and who reminded them of     what had been but with her it was exactly the opposite it was     the greatest effort and pain to her to see any one who had not     known them before and their mode of living as an instance she     said it cost her much to see the emperor of austria whom the     prince had never known evidently this clinging to things old will     form itself into a habit but i am afraid it may hereafter when     more have died off be a matter of difficulty to her it is     impossible to help seeing that she mistrusts lord russell’s     judgment in foreign affairs indeed i have already had clear proof     of this she likes lord palmerston’s better thinks he looks very     old and will not allow that it is all owing to an accident but     dinner is drawing near so goodbye we have had a good day and     have been up to the pyramid put on a hilltop as a memorial to the     prince with the beautiful inscription      sept 27—i do not think sunday is the best of days here i in     vain inquired with care about episcopal services there did not     seem to be one within fifteen miles if indeed so near we had     something between family prayer and a service in the diningroom     at ten it lasted about forty minutes dr caird gave a short     discourse good in material though over florid in style for my     taste the rest of the day i have had to myself the prince and     princess of hesse i think went to the parish church you are     better off at penmaenmawr i saw the two princes last night     they were playing billiards the prince of wales asked     particularly as always about you and willy      sept 28—i must be brief as i have been out riding with sir c     and miss phipps to altnaguisach the queen’s cottage and came     in late be assured all is very comfortable and restful here i     think too that i feel the air very invigorating my room is     pleasant and cheerful on the ground floor with a turret     dressingroom  i am pretty much master of my time today i     have heard nothing of the queen last evening i was summoned to     dine as was lady churchill it was extremely interesting we were     but seven in all and anything more beautifully domestic than the     queen and her family it was impossible to conceive the five were     her majesty prince and princess louis prince alfred and     princess helena princess louis whom the queen in speaking of     still calls princess alice asked about you all i had the     pleasure of hearing the good report of lucy altogether confirmed     from her lips and the queen’s the queen thinks her like her     dear mother she talked about many things and persons among     others the lyttelton family and asked about the boys seriatim     but pulled me up at once when in a fit of momentary oblivion i     said the new zealander was the third she spoke of the chancellor     and of roundell palmer i had a good opportunity of speaking him     up and found she had his book of hymns she spoke very freely     about the chancellor and i heard from her that the     attorneygeneral resigns on the score of health—of course palmer     succeeds prince alfred is going to edinburgh to study he is a     smart fellow and has plenty of go in him      sept 29—i have just come in at 6½ from a fine hill walk of     over three hours quite ready for another were there light and     opportunity      sept 30—i am come in from a nineteen mile walk to the lake of     lochnagar with dr bekker as fresh as a lark very wet the queen     sent me a message not to go up lochnagar top if there was mist     and mist there was with rain to boot i find the resemblance to     snowdon rather striking it is 3800 feet we went up about 3300     you forgot to tell me for what pious object you picked lord p’s     pocket nor do you distinctly tell me where to address but as you     say three nights i suppose it should be penmaenmawr last night we     went down to abergeldie to the gillies’ ball there was a dance     called the perpetual jig nearly the best fun i ever witnessed     the princes danced with great activity after deerstalking and     very well prince alfred i thought beautifully they were     immensely amused at having passed me on the way home and offered     me a lift to which i replied it was dark thinking they were     general grey and a household party the princess did not     dance—asked about you—is taking great care and the prince very     strict about it also she does not ride or fatigue herself the     event according to dr jenner should take place in march or     early in april you see his authority and yours are at variance     the queen was according to mrs bruce who dined with her very     low last night on account of the ball which naturally recalled     so much      oct 3—it happened oddly yesterday i was sent for while out i     had had a message from the queen in the morning which made me     think there would be no more so i went out at a quarter past     three i am very sorry this happened i am to see her i believe     this evening      oct 4—the service at ballater has made a great difference in     favour of this sunday it was celebrated in the free kirk     schoolroom for girls and with a congregation under twenty most     attentive though very small and no one left the room when we came     to the holy communion the knollys family and people were one half     or so i gave mrs knollys and one daughter a lift in my drag     back to birkhall 2½ miles which they all loyally walk to and     fro and had luncheon there i had thomas with me the sermon was     extremely good but the priest had a few antics i believe     this is about the first expedition ever made from balmoral to an     episcopal service perhaps encouraged by my example captain w     got a drag to castleton this morning being a roman there was     no chaplain here today and so no diningroom service which     for many i fear means no service at all      i dined with the queen again last night also lady augusta     bruce—seven again in all the crown princess had a headache as     well she might so they were not there the same royalties as     before and everything quite as pleasing the queen talked     shakespeare scott the use of the german language in england and     there i could not speak out all my mind guizot’s translation     of the prince’s speeches and his preface which the queen has     since sent me to look at the children’s play at windsor when     princess alice acted a high priest with great success—in     “athalie” i think the prussian children the queen says the     baby is not pretty—the little boy on coming yesterday called them     all stumpfnase pugnose handwritings lord palmerston’s to wit     mr disraeli’s style in his letters to the queen the proper mode     of writing on what paper etc and great laudation of lady     lyttelton’s letters princess alice declares her baby is pretty     and says she shall show it me the queen was very cheerful and     seemed for the time happy a statue of the prince is about to be     set up at aberdeen and she is then to attend and receive an     address with sir g grey present in due form the household life     is really very agreeable when one comes to know them one way and     another they have a great deal in them      oct 5—i have been riding to invercauld house and up above it     the beauty there even surpassed my high expectations and made     everything here look quite pale in comparison they were very     kind and offered me deerstalking we drank tea and ate scones      i have only time to tell you two things first the queen is on     friday to do her first public act to attend at the ’inauguration’     of the statue of the prince and to receive an address i am to be     there officially i have telegraphed for my uniform i go on to     aberdeen and trinity college at night and on saturday evening to     edinburgh there was fear that it might be on saturday and that i     should be kept but this could not be as saturday is a ’fast’ for     the periodical sacrament on sunday i told you the queen talked     about german on saturday at dinner among other things schiller’s     and coleridge’s wallenstein next morning she sent me through     lady a bruce the book with a passage of which i have hastily     translated the most important part it is easy to conceive how it     answers to her feelings      “too well i know the treasure i have lost     from off my life the bloom is swept away     it lies before me cold and colourless     for he that stood beside me like my youth     he charmed reality into a dream     and over all the common face of things     he shed the golden glow of morning’s blush     and in the fire of his affection     dull forms that throng the life of every day     yea to mine own amazement tow’red aloft     win what i may henceforth the beautiful     is gone and gone without return”75      you will say this was an opening in reading another part of the     book i found lines which i have turned as follows no better than     the others—      “for nothing other than a noble aim     up from its depths can stir humanity     the narrow circle narrows too the mind     and man grows greater as his ends are great”76      now i thought can i in reply call the queen’s attention to these     significant words a noble sermon i asked lady augusta of course     i mean the german words and she would not venture it had i a     viva voce chance i would try      oct 6—i am sorry you quitted penmaenmawr in the sulks—i mean     him in the sulks not you your exploit was great was it not     rather overgreat i have been out today for a real good seven     hours in the open air going up lochnagar the day was glorious     we went five gentlemen at least men e h was keen to go but     the queen would not let her thomas also went up with a party from     here and his raptures are such as would do you good he says     there is nothing it was not worth and he has no words to describe     his pleasure our party drove to loch muich and then went up     some of us on ponies some riding i walked it all and am not in     the least tired but quite ready if there were need to set out     for it again we saw towards the north as far as caithness i     could not do all that the others did in looking down the     precipices but i managed a little we had a very steep side to     come down covered with snow and very slippery i was put to it     and had to come very slow but lord c fitzroy like a good     samaritan kept me company the day was as lovely after frost and     snow in the night as anything could be and the whole is voted a     great success well there is a cabinet fixed for tuesday on the     whole this may be better than having it hang over one’s head      oct 7—the queen’s talk last night only think she wants to     read the french jesuit—don’t know this was about guizot’s     comparison of the prince and king william about macaulay america     and the ironclads where she was very national and highspirited     and schleswigholstein in which she is intensely interested     because the prince thought it a great case of justice on the side     rather opposite to that of lord palmerston and the government     policy she spoke about this with intense earnestness and said     she considered it a legacy from him      princess alice’s baby lives above me and i believe never cries i     never hear it we have been out riding to birkhall today and i     had much talk with lady churchill about the queen she lady c     feels and speaks most properly about her i told lady augusta last     night à propos to the lines i wanted to mention that i had     been a great coward and she too she was very submissive at     dinner in her manner to the queen and i told her it made me feel     i had been so impudent only think of this both through her and     through general grey it has come round to me that the queen thinks     she was too cheerful on the night i last dined this she feels a     kind of sin she said however to lady augusta she was sure i     should understand it i am very glad and a little surprised     that mrs bruce should say i have a good name here the people     are one and all very easy to get on with and windsor i     suppose stiffens them a little      oct 8—the queen has had a most providential escape the     carriage a sociable very low and safe was overturned last night     after dark on her way back from an expedition of seven or eight     hours princesses louis of hesse and helena were with her they     were undermost and not at all hurt the queen was shot out of the     carriage and received a contusion on the temple and sprained a     thumb when she got in i think near ten o’clock dr jenner     wished her to go to bed but she said it was of no use and she     would not she was very confident however about performing the     duties of the ceremonial in aberdeen tomorrow but now this     evening it is given up and i do not doubt this is wise but much     inconvenience will be caused by so late a postponement i have     been up to the place today the queen should give up these     drives after dark it is impossible to guarantee them but she     says she feels the hours from her drive to dinner such weary     hours      little princess victoria paid me a visit in my bedroom which is     also sittingroom today she is of sweet temper decidedly     pretty very like both the queen and her mother then i went to     see the three prussian children and the two elder ones played     with my rusty old stick of twenty or twentyfive years’ standing      holyrood oct 11—on friday morning as i expected i talked to     the queen until the last moment she did give me opportunities     which might have led on to anything but want of time hustled me     and though i spoke abruptly enough and did not find myself timid     yet i could not manage it at all to my satisfaction she said     the one purpose of her life was gone and she could not help     wishing the accident had ended it this is hardly qualified by     another thing which she said to lady churchill that she should     not like to have died in that way she went on to speak of her     life as likely to be short i told her that she would not give     way that duty would sustain her this she quite recognised that     her burden was altogether peculiar but the honour was in     proportion that no one could wonder at her feeling the present     which is near but that the reward is there though distant     then about politics which will keep she rowed me for writing to     lord palmerston about her accident and said “but dear mr     gladstone that was quite wrong” the secret is kept wonderfully     and you must keep it i hinted that it would be a very bad thing     to have g grey away from such a cabinet on tuesday but all i     could get was that i might arrange for any other minister some     one there certainly ought to be i lectured her a little for     driving after dark in such a country but she said all her habits     were formed on the prince’s wishes and directions and she could     not alter them      hawarden dec 29—i am well past half a century my life has     not been inactive but of what kind has been its activity     inwardly i feel it to be open to this general observation it     seems to have been and to be a series of efforts to be and to do     what is beyond my natural force this of itself is not     condemnation though it is a spectacle effectually humbling when i     see that i have not according to schiller’s figure enlarged with     the circle in which i live and move diary    iv       jan 2 1864—the cabinet was on matters of great importance     connected with denmark and has decided rightly to seek the     cooperation of france and other powers before talking about the     use in any event of force77 lord palmerston has gout sharply     in the hand the queen wrote a letter which i think did her great     credit her love of truth and wish to do right prevent all     prejudices from effectually warping her      the queen talked much about the danish question and is very     desirous of a more staid and quiet foreign policy for the first     time i think she takes a just credit to herself for having     influenced beneficially the course of policy and of affairs in the     late controversy      balmoral sept 28—i thought the queen’s state of health and     spirits last night very satisfactory she looks better more like     what she used to look and the spirits were very even with the     little references to the prince just as usual whenever she quotes     an opinion of the prince she looks upon the question as     completely shut up by it for herself and all the world prince     alfred is going to germany for nine weeks—to study at bonn and to     be more or less at coburg the queen asked for you of course she     has not said a syllable about public affairs to me since i came     but talked pleasantly of all manner of things      sept 29—the queen sent to offer a day’s deerstalking but i     am loth to trust my long eyesight      oct 2—at dinner last night there was a great deal of     conversation and today i have been near an hour with the queen     after coming back from ballater she was as good and as gracious     as possible i can hardly tell you all the things talked     about—prince humbert garibaldi lady lyttelton the hagley boys     lucy smoking dress fashion prince alfred his establishment     and future plans prince of wales’s visit to denmark revenue     lancashire foreign policy the newspaper press the habits of the     present generation young men young married ladies clubs     clarendon’s journey the prince consort on dress and fashion     prince of wales on ditto sir r peel f peel mrs stonor the     rest of that family misreading foreign names and words repute of     english people abroad happy absence of foreign office disputes     and quarrels      oct 3—i am just in from a sixteen mile walk quite fresh and     pleased with myself for having in my old age walked a measured     mile in twelve minutes by the side of this beautiful dee      oct 7—i have just come in from a delightful twentyfive miles     ride with general grey and another companion i had another long     interview with the queen today she talked most and very freely     and confidentially about the prince of wales also about lord     russell and lord palmerston and about granville and clarendon     the latter perhaps to an effect that will a little surprise you     also the dean of windsor it was a kind of farewell audience     chapter vii garibaldi—denmark 1864       there are in europe two great questions the question called     social and the question of nationalities the map of europe has     to be remade i affirm with profound conviction that this     movement of nationalities has attained in italy in hungary in     vienna in a great part of germany and in some of the slavonian     populations a degree of importance that must at no distant period     produce decisive results the first warcry that arises will     carry with it a whole zone of europe—mazzini 1852    i   “my confidence in the italian parliament and people” mr gladstone wrote to lacaita at the end of 1862 “increases from day to day their selfcommand moderation patience firmness and forethought reaching far into the future are really beyond all praise” and a few days later again to lacaita—“your letter proves that the king has not merely got the constitutional lesson by rote—though even this for an italian king would be much but that the doctrine has sunk into the marrow and the bone” the cause was won and the work of construction went forward but not on such lines as cavour’s masterhand was likely to have traced very early mr gladstone began to be uneasy about italian finance “i am sure” he wrote to lacaita in april 1863 “that italian freedom has no greater enemy in the triple crown or elsewhere than large continuing deficits”  as events marched forward the french occupation of rome became an ever greater scandal in mr gladstone’s eyes he writes to panizzi october 28 1862—       my course about the emperor has been a very simple one it is not     for me to pass gratuitous opinions upon his character or that of     french institutions or on his dealings with them i believe him     to be firmly attached to the english alliance and i think his     course towards us has been on almost every occasion marked by a     friendliness perhaps greater and more conspicuous than we have     always deserved at his hands it is most painful to me to witness     his conduct with regard to italy he conferred upon her in 1859     an immense an inestimable boon he marred this boon in a way     which to me seemed little worthy of france by the paltry but     unkind appropriation of nice in particular but in the matter of     rome he inflicts upon italy a fearful injury and i do not know by     what law of ethics any one is entitled to plead the having     conferred an unexpected boon as giving a right to inflict a gross     and enduring wrong78   it was in 1862 that mr gladstone made his greatest speech on italian affairs79 “i am ashamed to say” he told the house “that for a long time i like many withheld my assent and approval from italian yearnings” he amply atoned for his tardiness and his exposure of naples where perjury was the tradition of its kings of the government of the pope in the romagna where the common administration of law and justice was handed over to austrian soldiery of the stupid and execrable lawlessness of the duke of modena of the attitude of austria as a dominant and conquering nation over a subject and conquered race—all this stamped a decisive impression on the minds of his hearers along with his speech on reform in 1864 and that on the irish church in the spring of 1865 it secured mr gladstone’s hold upon all of the rising generation of liberals who cared for the influence and the good name of great britain in europe and who were capable of sympathising with popular feeling and the claims of national justice    ii   m31 the italian sentiment of england reached its climax in the reception accorded to garibaldi by the metropolis in april 1864 “i do not know what persons in office are to do with him” mr gladstone wrote to lord palmerston march 26 “but you will lead and we shall follow suit” the populace took the thing into their own hands london has seldom beheld a spectacle more extraordinary or more moving the hero in the red shirt and bluegrey cloak long associated in the popular mind with so many thrilling stories of which they had been told drove from the railway at vauxhall to stafford house the noblest of the private palaces of the capital amid vast continuous multitudes blocking roadways filling windows lining every parapet and roof with eager gazers for five hours garibaldi passed on amid tumultuous waves of passionate curiosity delight enthusiasm and this more than regal entry was the arrival not of some loved prince or triumphant captain of our own but of a foreigner and the deliverer of a foreign people some were drawn by his daring as a fighter and by the picturesque figure as of a hero of antique mould many by sight of the sworn foe of giant pope but what fired the hearts of most was the thought of him as the soldier who bore the sword for human freedom the western world was in one of its generous moments in those days there were idealists democracy was conscious of common interests and common brotherhood a liberal europe was then a force and not a dream  “we who then saw garibaldi for the first time” mr gladstone said nearly twenty years after “can many of us never forget the marvellous effect produced upon all minds by the simple nobility of his demeanour by his manners and his acts besides his splendid integrity and his wide and universal sympathies besides that seductive simplicity of manner which never departed from him and that inborn and native grace which seemed to attend all his actions i would almost select from every other quality this which was in apparent contrast but real harmony in garibaldi—the union of the most profound and tender humanity with his fiery valour”80 he once described the italian chief to me as “one of the finest combinations of profound and unalterable simplicity with selfconsciousness and selfpossession i shall never forget an occasion at chiswick palmerston john russell and all the leaders were awaiting him on the perron he advanced with perfect simplicity and naturalness yet with perfect consciousness of his position very striking and very fine” garibaldi dined with mr gladstone and they met elsewhere at a dinner at panizzi’s they sat by one another “i remember” said mr gladstone “he told a story in these words ‘when i was a boy’ he said ‘i was at school in genoa it was towards the close of the great french revolution genoa was a great military post—a large garrison always in the town constant parades and military display with bands and flags that were beyond everything attractive to schoolboys all my schoolfellows used to run here and there all over the town to see if they could get sight of one of these military parades and exhibitions i never went to one it struck me then as a matter of pain and horror that it should be necessary that one portion of mankind should be set aside to have for their profession the business of destroying others’ ”  another side of garibaldi was less congenial a great lady wrote to mr gladstone of a conversation with him “i talked to garibaldi with regret that renan was so much read in italy he said ‘perche’ and showed that he did not dislike it and that he has also in leaving rome left very much else i know that woman’s words are useless the more men disbelieve the more they think it well that women should be ‘superstitious’ you are not likely to have arguments with him but i would give much that he should take away with him some few words that would bring home to him the fact that the statesman he cares for most would think life a miserable thing without faith in god our saviour” to another correspondent on this point mr gladstone wrote—       the honour paid him was i think his due as a most singularly     simple disinterested and heroic character who had achieved     great things for italy for liberty wellunderstood and even for     mankind his insurrection we knew and lamented and treated as     exceptional no mazzinian leanings of his were known i read the     speech at the luncheon with surprise and concern81 as to his     attenuated belief i view it with the deepest sorrow and concern     i need not repeat an opinion always painful to me to pronounce     as to the principal causes to which it is referable and as to the     chief seat of the responsibility for it as to his goddess reason     i understand by it simply an adoption of what are called on the     continent the principles of the french revolution these we     neither want nor warmly relish in england but they are different     from its excesses and the words will bear an innocent and even in     some respects a beneficial meaning   the diary records—       april 12—to chiswick and met garibaldi we were quite satisfied     with him he did me much more than justice 14—went by a     desperate push to see garibaldi welcomed at the opera it was     good but not like the people 17—at stafford house 514—6½     and 914—12½ on garibaldi’s movements in a conversation he     agreed to give up the provincial tour 20—in the evening the     great entertainment to garibaldi came off before the door at     night say a thousand people all in the best of humour the hall     and stair full before dinner a hostile demonstration invaded us     at ten but we ejected them i settled about tomorrow with     garibaldi the duke of sutherland lord palmerston and lord     shaftesbury my nerves would not let me—hardened as i am—sleep     till after five   m32 suddenly one morning the country was surprised to learn that garibaldi was at once departing dark suspicions rose instantly in the minds of his more democratic friends it had always been rather bitter to them that he should be the guest of a duke they now insisted that the whig aristocrats were in a panic lest he should compromise himself with the radicals and that he was being hustled out of the country against his will this suspicion next grew into something blacker still a story spread that the emperor of the french had taken umbrage and signified to the government that the reception of garibaldi was distasteful to france lord clarendon promptly denied the fable he told the house of lords that the emperor of whom he had recently had an audience had even expressed his admiration for the feeling of which the reception was a sign lord palmerston in the other house explained that garibaldi was going away earlier than had been expected because at home he went to bed at eight and rose at five and to a person of these habits to dine at half past eight and to remain in a throng of admirers until midnight must necessarily be injurious still the fog hung heavy on the public mind a rider was now added to the tale that it was the chancellor of the exchequer who out of deference to the emperor or to please the whigs or out of complaisance to the court had induced the hero to take his hurried leave mr gladstone was forced to explain to the house of commons seldom reluctant to lighten its graver deliberations with a personal incident that the duke of sutherland had carried him to stafford house there he found that garibaldi had accepted invitations to thirty provincial towns and that the list was growing longer every day the doctors declared that the general’s strength would never stand the exhaustion of a progress on such a scale and the friends there present begged him to express his own opinion to garibaldi this mr gladstone accordingly did to the effect that the hero’s life and health were objects of value to the whole world and that even apart from health the repetition all over england of the national reception in london would do something to impair a unique historical event82 the general was taken to show excellent sense by accepting advice not to allow himself to be killed by kindness at any rate he firmly declared that if he could not go to all the places that invited him it was impossible for him to draw a line of preference and therefore he would go to none his radical friends however seem to have instilled some of their own suspicions into his mind for two days later april 23 mr gladstone writes to lord clarendon “i am to see garibaldi at cliveden this evening and it is possible that some occasion may offer there for obtaining from him a further declaration but since i received your note the following circumstance has occurred clarence paget has been to me and reports that mrs —— a wellknown and zealous but antimazzinian liberal in italian matters who is also a friend of garibaldi’s has acquainted him that garibaldi himself has made known to her that according to his own painful impression the english government do consider the prolongation of his stay in england very embarrassing and are very anxious that he should go what a pity if this be so that this simple and heroic man could not speak his mind plainly out to me but wrapped himself in the depths of diplomatic reserve instead of acting like lord aberdeen who used to say ‘i have a habit of believing people’ ”83 after three or four days at cliveden the general still held to his purpose “april 24—cliveden conversation with garibaldi the utmost i could get from him was that it would be sad if the italian people should lose its faith” so garibaldi forthwith sailed away from our shores84  when all was over an italian statesman wrote to panizzi that though he thought garibaldi one of the choicest natures ever created—enterprising humane disinterested eminent in national service yet neither he nor any other citizen was entitled to set himself above the laws of his country and that such a man should be officially received by the heir to the throne and by secretaries of state was a thing to be bitterly deplored by every sensible man85 still history can afford to agree with mr gladstone when he said of garibaldi—“his name is indeed illustrious it remains inseparably connected with the not less illustrious name of the great cavour and these two names are again associated with the name of victor emmanuel these three together form for italians a tricolour as brilliant as ever fresh and i hope as enduring for many and many generations as the national flag that now waves over united italy”    iii   the tide of vast events in this momentous period now rolled heavily away from the danube and the bosphorus from tiber and po and adriatic sea to the shores of the baltic and the mouths of the elbe none of the fascination of oldworld history lends its magic to the new chapter that opened in 1863 cavour had gone bismarck with sterner genius fiercer purpose more implacable designs and with a hand as of hammered iron strode into the field the italian statesman was the author of a singular prediction in 1861 when cavour was deprecating angry protests from the european powers against his invasion of the marches he used words of extraordinary foresight to the representative of prussia “i am sorry” he said “that the cabinet of berlin judges so severely the conduct of the king of italy and his government i console myself by thinking that on this occasion i am setting an example that probably in no long time prussia will be very glad to imitate”86 so the world speedily found out  m33 the torch of nationality reached material for a flame long smouldering in two duchies of the remote north that had been incorporated in denmark by solemn european engagements in 1852 but were inhabited by a population one of them wholly and the other mainly not scandinavian but german thus the same question of race history language sentiment that had worked in italy poland the balkan states rose up in this miniature case the circumstances that brought that case into such fatal prominence do not concern us here the alleged wrongs of her brethren in schleswigholstein unchained such a tempest of excitement in central germany that the german courts could hardly have resisted if they would just as powerless was the danish government in face of the scandinavian sentiment of its subjects and their neighbours of the race even the liberals then a power in germany and bismarck’s bitter foes were vehemently on the national side against the danish claim and one of the most striking of all bismarck’s feats was the skill with which he now used his domestic enemies to further his own designs of national aggrandisement how war broke out between the small power and the two great powers of austria and prussia and how the small power was ruthlessly crushed by what infinite and complex machinations the diplomacy of europe found itself paralysed how prussia audaciously possessed herself of territory that would give her a deepwater port and the head of a channel that would unite two great seas how all this ended in prussia “the piedmont of the north” doing what cavour in his piedmont of the south had foretold that she would be glad to do how at sadowa july 3 1866 austria was driven out of her long hegemony and hanover incorporated and to what a train of amazing conflicts in western europe to what unexpected victories territorial change dynastic ruin this so resistlessly led up—here is a narrative that belongs to the province of history yet it has a place in any political biography of the palmerston administration  in such an era of general confusion the english cabinet found no powerful or noble part to play still they went far—almost too far to recede—towards embarking in a continental war on behalf of denmark that would have been full of mischief to herself of little profit to her client and could hardly have ended otherwise than in widespread disaster here is one of the very few instances in which the public opinion of the country at the eleventh hour reined back a warlike minister lord palmerston told the house of commons in the summer of 1863 that if any violent attempt were made to overthrow the rights of denmark or to interfere with its independence and integrity he was convinced that those who made the attempt would find in the result that “it would not be denmark alone with which they would have to contend”87 this did indeed sound like a compromising declaration of quite sufficient emphasis       it seems says mr gladstone88 that this statement was     generally and not unnaturally interpreted as a promise of support     from england lord palmerston does not seem to have added any     condition or reservation strange as it may appear he had spoken     entirely of his own motion and without the authority or knowledge     of his cabinet in which indeed so far as my memory serves     nothing had happened to render likely any declaration of any kind     on the subject i have no means of knowing whether he spoke in     concert with the foreign secretary earl russell with whom his     communications agreeably to policy and to established usage     were i believe large and constant when the question was     eventually disposed of by the war which prussia and austria waged     against denmark there was much indignation felt against england     for the breach of her engagement to give support in the case of     war to the small power so egregiously in need of it and there     was no one to raise a voice in our favour      as the year advanced 1863 and the prospect of war came nearer     the subject was very properly brought before the cabinet i     believe that at the time i was not even aware of lord palmerston’s     declaration which owing to the exhausted period of the session     had i believe attracted no great amount of attention in england     whether my colleagues generally were as little aware of what     happened as myself i do not know but unquestionably we could not     all have missed learning it however we did not as a body     recognise in any way the title of the prime minister to bind us to     go to war we were however indignant at the conduct of the     german powers who as we thought were scheming piracy under cover     of pacific correspondence and we agreed upon a very important     measure in which lord palmerston acquiesced when he had failed     if i remember right in inducing the cabinet to go farther we     knew that france took the same view of the question as we did and     we framed a communication to her to the following effect we were     jointly to insist that the claim of the duke of augustenburg     should be peacefully settled on juridical grounds and to announce     to prussia and austria that if they proceeded to prosecute it by     the use of force against denmark we would jointly resist them     with all our might89      this communication was accordingly made to louis napoleon he     declined the proposal he said that the question was one of     immense importance to us who had such vast interests involved     and that the plan was reasonable from our point of view but that     the matter was one of small moment for france whom accordingly we     could not ask to join in it the explanation of this answer so     foolish in its terms and so pregnant with consequences in this     matter was i believe to be found in the pique of louis napoleon     at a reply we had then recently given to a proposal of his for an     european conference or congress90 we all thought that his plan     was wholly needless and would in all likelihood lead to mischief     so we declined it in perfect good faith and without implying by     our refusal any difference of policy in the particular matter   throughout the session of 1864 the attention of the country was fixed upon this question whether england should or should not take part in the war between germany and denmark the week before the time arrived for the minister to announce the decision of the cabinet it became clear that public opinion in the great english centres would run decisively for nonintervention some of the steadiest supporters of government in parliament boldly told the party whips that if war against germany were proposed they would vote against it the cabinet met palmerston and lord russell were for war even though it would be war singlehanded little support came to them the queen was strongly against them they bemoaned to one another the timidity of their colleagues and halfmournfully contrasted the convenient ciphers that filled the cabinets of pitt and peel with the number of able men with independent opinions in their own administration the prime minister as i have heard from one who was present held his head down while the talk proceeded and then at last looking up said in a neutral voice “i think the cabinet is against war” here is mr gladstone’s record—       may 7 ’64—cabinet the war “party” as it might be called—lord     palmerston lord russell lord stanley of alderley and the     chancellor lord westbury all went well june 11—cabinet     very stiff on the danish question but went well june     24—cabinet a grave issue well discussed june 25—cabinet we     divided and came to a tolerable not the best conclusion   it seems almost incredible that a cabinet of rational men could have debated for ten minutes the question of going to war with prussia and austria when they knew that twenty thousand men were the largest force that we could have put into the field when war began though moderate additions might have been made as time went on—not however without hazardous denudation of india where the memories of the mutiny were still fresh the emperor of the french in fact had good reason for fearing that he would be left in the lurch again as he thought that he had been left before in his attempts for poland your intervention he said to england will be naval but we may have to fight a people of forty millions on land and we will not intervene unless you engage to send troops91 the dismemberment of denmark was thought an odious feat but the localisation of the war was at least a restriction of the evils attending it  m34 a high parliamentary debate followed july 4 on a motion made by mr disraeli “to express to her majesty our great regret that while the course pursued by the government had failed to maintain their avowed policy of upholding the independence and integrity of denmark it has lowered the just influence of this country in the councils of europe and thereby diminished the securities for peace”92 cobden taunted both front benches pretty impartially with the equivocal and most dishonourable position into which their policy had brought the country by encouraging a small power to fight two great ones and then straightway leaving her to get out as best she might the government was only saved by palmerston’s appeal to its financial triumphs—the very triumphs that he had himself made most difficult to achieve the appeal was irrelevant but it was decisive and ministers escaped a condemnation by no means unmerited on the special issue by a majority of eighteen the manchester men agreed to help in the result because in cobden’s words they were convinced that a revolution had been at last wrought in the mischievous policy of incessant intervention mr disraeli’s case was easy but to propound an easy case when its exposition demands much selection from voluminous bluebooks is often hard and the orator was long and overelaborate the excitement of an audience aware all the time that actual danger hovered over the ministry revived afresh when disraeli sat down and gladstone rose the personal emulation of powerful rivals lends dramatic elements to disputation lord palmerston had written to mr gladstone beforehand—“we shall want a great gun to follow disraeli would you be ready to follow him”       july 3—i was happy enough aided by force of habit to drive     bodily out of my head for the whole day everything danogerman     but not out of my nerves i delivered during the night a speech in     parliament on the roman question      july 4—h of c replied to disraeli it took an hour and     thirtyfive minutes i threw overboard all my heavy armament and     fought light   nobody who is not historian or biographer is likely to read this speech of mr gladstone’s today but we may believe contemporary witnesses who record that the orator’s weight of fact his force of argument his sarcastic play of personal impulse and motive his bold and energetic refutation of hostile criticism his defiant statement of the ministerial case so impressed even a sceptical and doubting house that though his string of special pleas did not amount to a justification “they almost reached the height of an excuse” and they crushed the debate the basis was the familiar refrain upon mr gladstone’s lips—“the steps taken by the government what were they but endeavours to bind together the powers of europe for fulfilment and maintenance of an important european engagement” still history even of that sane and tempered school that is content to take politics as often an affair of secondbest will probably judge that mr disraeli was not wrong when he said of the policy of this era that whether we looked to russia to greece to france there had been exhibited by ministers a confusion an inconsistency of conduct a contrariety of courses with regard to the same powers and a total want of system in their diplomacy93 it is true however that just the same confusion inconsistency and contrariety marked russia france and austria themselves another speaker of the same party as mordant as disraeli and destined like him to rise to the chief place in the councils of the nation went further and said in following cobden in the debate “if mr cobden had been foreign secretary instead of lord russell i fully believe this country would occupy a position proud and noble compared to that which she occupies at this moment she would at least have been entitled to the credit of holding out in the name of england no hopes which she did not intend to fulfil of entering into no engagements from which she was ready to recede”94 well might mr gladstone enter in his diary—       july 8—this debate ought to be an epoch in foreign policy we     have all much to learn lord palmerston’s speech was unequivocally     weak in the mental and the bodily sense i think it was today     that the prince of wales rode with granville and me he showed a     little danism     chapter viii advance in public position and otherwise 1864       the best form of government is that which doth actuate and dispose     every part and member of a state to the common good if instead     of concord and interchange of support one part seeks to uphold an     old form of government and the other part introduce a new they     will miserably consume one and other histories are full of the     calamities of entire states and nations in such cases it is     nevertheless equally true that time must needs bring about some     alterations therefore have those commonwealths been ever the     most durable and perpetual which have often formed and recomposed     themselves according to their first institution and     ordinance—pym    i   a rapid and extraordinary change began to take place in mr gladstone’s position after the year 1863 with this was associated an internal development of his political ideas and an expansion of social feeling still more remarkable and interesting as we have seen he reckoned that a little earlier than this he had reached his lowest point in public estimation he had now been more than thirty years in parliament he had sat in three cabinets each of a different colour and different connections from the other two it was not until he had seen half a century of life on our planet and more than quarter of a century of life in the house of commons that it was at all certain whether he would be conservative or liberal to what species of either genus he would attach himself or whether there might not from his progressive transmutations be evolved some variety wholly new  i have already given his picture of the palmerston cabinet as a kaleidoscope and the same simile would be no bad account of his own relation to the political groups and parties around him the manchester men and the young radicals from the west riding of yorkshire were his ardent adherents when he preached economy and peace but they were chilled to the core by his neutrality or worse upon the life and death struggle across the atlantic his bold and confident finance was doubted by the whigs and disliked by the tories but then the tories apart from their wiser leader were delighted by his friendly words about the confederates and the whigs were delighted with his unflagging zeal for the deliverance of italy only zeal for the deliverance of italy lost him the friendship of those children of the holy father who came from ireland then again the city was not easy at the flash of activity and enterprise at the exchequer and the moneychangers did not know what disturbance this intrepid genius might bring into the traffic of their tables on the other hand the manufacturers and the merchants of the midlands and the north adored a chancellor whose budgets were associated with expanding trade and a prosperity that advanced by leaps and bounds the nonconformists were attracted by his personal piety though repelled by its ecclesiastical apparel the high churchmen doubtless knew him for their own yet even they resented his confederacy with an erastian and a latitudinarian like john russell or a gallio like lord palmerston who distributed mitres and crown benefices at the ultraevangelical bidding of lord shaftesbury to borrow a figure from a fine observer of those days—the political molecules were incessantly forming and reforming themselves into shifting aggregates now attracted now repelled by his central force now the nucleus of an organised party then resolved again in loose and distant satellites  the great families still held ostensibly the predominance in the liberal party which they had earned by their stout and persistent fidelity to parliamentary reform their days of leadership however were drawing towards an end though the process has not been rapid they produced some good administrators but nobody with the gifts of freshness and political genius the three originating statesmen of that era after all were cobden gladstone disraeli none of them m35 born in the purple of the directing class a yorkshire member destined to a position of prominence entered the house in 1861 and after he had been there a couple of years he wrote to his wife that “the want of the liberal party of a new man was great and felt to be great the old whig leaders were worn out there were no new whigs cobden and bright were impracticable and unenglish and there were hardly any hopeful radicals there was a great prize of power and influence to be aimed at”95  this parliamentary situation was the least part of it no man could guide the new advance now so evidently approaching unless he clearly united fervour and capacity for practical improvements in government to broad and glowing sympathies alike with the needs and the elemental instincts of the labouring mass mr gladstone offered that wonderful combination “if ever there was a statesman” said mill about this time “in whom the spirit of improvement is incarnate and in whose career as a minister the characteristic feature has been to seek out things that require or admit of improvement instead of waiting to be pressed or driven to do them mr gladstone deserves that signal honour” then his point of view was lofty he was keenly alive to the moving forces of the hour his horizons were wide he was always amply founded in facts he had generous hopes for mankind his oratory seized vast popular audiences because it was the expression of a glowing heart and a powerful brain all this made him a demagogue in the same high sense in which pericles demosthenes john pym patrick henry were demagogues  it is easy to see some at any rate of the influences that were bringing mr gladstone decisively into harmony with the movement of liberal opinions now gradually spreading over great britain the resurrection of italy could only be vindicated on principles of liberty and the right of a nation to choose its own rulers the peers and the tenpound householders who held power in england were no bourbon tyrants but just as in 1830 the overthrow of the bourbon line in france was followed by the reform bill here so the italian revolution of 1860 gave new vitality to the popular side in england another convulsion far away from our own shores was still more directly potent alike in quickening popular feeling and by a strange paradox in creating as a great popular leader the very statesman who had failed to understand it it was impossible that a man so vigilant and so impressionable as mr gladstone was should escape the influence of the american war though too late to affect his judgment on the issues of the war he discerned after the event how in his own language the wide participation of the people in the choice of their governors by giving force and expression to the national will in the united states enabled the governors thus freely chosen to marshal a power and develop an amount of energy in the execution of that will such as probably have never been displayed in an equal time and among an equal number of men since the race of mankind sprang into existence96 in this judgment of the american civil war he only shared in a general result of the salvation of the union it reversed the fashionable habit of making american institutions english bugbears and gave a sweeping impulse to that steady but resistless tide of liberal and popular sentiment that ended in the parliamentary reform of 1867  the lesson from the active resolution of america was confirmed by the passive fortitude of lancashire “what are the questions” mr gladstone asked in 1864 “that fit a man for the exercise of a privilege such as the franchise selfcommand selfcontrol respect for order patience under suffering confidence in the law regard for superiors and when i should like to ask were all these great qualities exhibited in a manner more signal even more illustrious than in the conduct of the general body of the operatives of lancashire under the profound affliction of the winter of 1862” so on two sides the liberal channel was widened and deepened and the speed of its currents accelerated  besides large common influences like these mr gladstone’s special activities as a reformer brought him into contact with the conditions of life and feeling among the workmen m36 and the closer he came to them the more did his humane and sympathetic temper draw him towards their politics and the ranks of their party looking back he said upon the years immediately succeeding the fall of napoleon in 1815 he saw the reign of ideas that did not at all belong to the old currents of english history but were a reaction against the excesses of the french revolution this reaction seemed to set up the doctrine that the masses must be in standing antagonism to the law and it resulted in severities that well justified antagonism “today the scene was transformed the fixed traditional sentiment of the working man had become one of confidence in the law in parliament even in the executive government” in 1863 he was busy in the erection of the post office savings banks a deputation of a powerful trades union asked him to modify his rules so as to enable them to place their funds in the hands of the government a generation before such confidence would have been inconceivable in connection with the government annuities bill a deputation of workmen came to him and said “if there had been any suspicion or disinclination towards it on the part of the working classes it was due to the dissatisfaction with parliament as to suffrage” when he replied with something about the alleged indifference and apparent inaction of the working classes as to suffrage they said “since the abolition of the corn laws we have given up political agitation we felt we might place confidence in parliament instead of political action we tried to spend our evenings in the improvement of our minds” this convinced him that it was not either want of faith in parliament or indifference to a vote that explained the absence of agitation    ii   the outcome of this stream of new perceptions and new feeling in his mind was a declaration that suddenly electrified the political world a yorkshire liberal one afternoon may 11 1864 brought in a bill for lowering the franchise and mr gladstone spoke for the government he dwelt upon the facts historic and political the parliamentary history of reform for the thirteen years since locke king’s motion in 1851 upset a government had been most unsatisfactory and to set aside all the solemn and formal declarations from 1851 down to the abortive reform bill of 1860 would be a scandal then was not the state of the actual case something of a scandal with less than onetenth of the constituencies composed of working men and with less than onefiftieth of the working men in possession of the franchise how could you defend a system that let in the lower stratum of the middle class and shut out the upper stratum of the working class in face of such dispositions as the workmen manifested towards law parliament and government was it right that the present system of almost entire exclusion should prevail then came the sentence that in that stagnant or floundering hour of parliamentary opinion marked a crisis “i call upon the adversary to show cause and i venture to say that every man who is not presumably incapacitated by some consideration of personal unfitness or of political danger is morally entitled to come within the pale of the constitution of course in giving utterance to such a proposition i do not recede from the protest i have previously made against sudden or violent or excessive or intoxicating change”  he concluded in words that covered much ground though when closely scrutinised they left large loopholes “it is well” he said “that we should be suitably provided with armies and fleets and fortifications it is well too that all these should rest upon and be sustained as they ought to be by a sound system of finance and out of a revenue not wasted by a careless parliament or by a profligate administration but that which is better and more weighty still is that hearts should be bound together by a reasonable extension at fitting times and among selected portions of the people of every benefit and every privilege that can be justly conferred upon them”  the thunderbolt of a sentence about every man’s moral title to a vote startled the house with an amazement half delight and half consternation that broke forth in loud volleys of cheering and countercheering it was to little m37 purpose that the orator in the next breath interposed his qualifications one of the fated words had been spoken that gather up wandering forces of time and occasion and precipitate new eras a conservative speaker instantly deplored the absence of the prime minister and the substitution in his stead of his “intractable chancellor of the exchequer” an important liberal speaker with equal promptitude pointed out that one effect of the speech would be in the first place loss of conservative support to the government and in the second place a very great gain to the health and vigour of the liberal party two whigs ran off to tell phillimore that gladstone had said something that would make his hair stand on end speculations began to hum and buzz whether the oracular deliverance would not upset the government in the press a tremendous storm broke mr gladstone was accused of ministering aliments to popular turbulence and vanity of preaching the divine right of multitudes and of encouraging minister of the crown though he was a sweeping and levelling democracy they charged him with surveying mankind in the abstract and suffrage in the abstract and in that kingdom of shadows discovering or constructing vast universal propositions about man’s moral rights mr disraeli told him that he had revived the doctrine of tom paine the radicals were as jubilant as whigs and tories were furious they declared that the banner he had raised aloft was not what the tories denounced as the standard of domestic revolution but the long lost flag of the liberal party “there is not a statesman in england of the very first rank” said one newspaper “who has dared to say as much and mr gladstone in saying it has placed himself at the head of the party that will succeed the present administration” this was true but in the meantime the head of the existing administration was still a marvel of physical vigour and though at the moment he was disabled by gout somebody must have hurried to cambridge house and told him the desperate tidings on the very instant he sent down a note of inquiry to mr gladstone asking what he had really said a brisk correspondence followed neither heated nor unfriendly  in the morning lord palmerston had written him a premonitory note not to commit himself or the government to any particular figure of borough franchise that a six pound franchise had gone to the bottom that if they should ever have to bring in a reform bill they ought to be free from fresh pledges that the workmen would swamp the classes above them that their influx would discourage the classes above from voting at all and that the workmen were under the control of trade unions directed by a small number of agitators all this was the good conservative common form of the time the speech itself when the prime minister came to see it proved no sedative       lord palmerston to mr gladstone      may 12 1864—i have read your speech and i must frankly say     with much regret as there is little in it that i can agree with     and much from which i differ you lay down broadly the doctrine of     universal suffrage which i can never accept i entirely deny that     every sane and not disqualified man has a moral right to a vote i     use that expression instead of “the pale of the constitution”     because i hold that all who enjoy the security and civil rights     which the constitution provides are within its pale what every     man and woman too has a right to is to be well governed and under     just laws and they who propose a change ought to show that the     present organisation does not accomplish those objects      you did not pronounce an opinion in favour of a specified     franchise but is there any essential difference between naming a     six pound franchise and naming the additional numbers which a six     pound franchise was calculated to admit i am not going to perform     the duty which whiteside assigned to me of answering your speech     but if you will not take it amiss i would say that it was more     like the sort of speech with which bright would have introduced     the reform bill which he would like to propose than the sort of     speech which might have been expected from the treasury bench in     the present state of things your speech may win lancashire for     you though that is doubtful but i fear it will tend to lose     england for you      mr gladstone to lord palmerston      11 carlton house terrace may 13 1864—it is not easy to take     ill anything that proceeds from you and moreover frankness     between all men and especially between those who are politically     associated removes as i believe many more difficulties than it     causes in this spirit i will endeavour to write i agree in your     denial “that every sane and not disqualified man has a moral right     to vote” but i am at a loss to know how as you have read my     speech you can ascribe this opinion to me my declaration was     taken generally that all persons ought to be admitted to the     franchise who can be admitted to it with safety i hold by     this proposition it seems to me neither strange nor new nor     extreme it requires i admit to be construed but i contend that     the interpretation is amply given in the speech where i have     declared for example that the admission i desire is of the same     character or rather extent as was proposed in 1860 i have     never exhorted the working man to agitate for the franchise and i     am at a loss to conceive what report of my speech can have been     construed by you in such a sense      having said this much to bring down to its true limits the     difference between us i do not deny that difference i regret it     and i should regret it much more if it were likely to have at     least as far as i can see an early bearing upon practice in the     cabinet i argued as strongly as i could against the withdrawal of     the bill in 1860 and in favour of taking the opinion of the house     of commons upon that bill i think the party which supports your     government has suffered and is suffering and will much more     seriously suffer from the part which as a party it has played     within these recent years in regard to the franchise i have no     desire to press the question forward i hope no government will     ever again take it up except with the full knowledge of its own     mind and a reasonable probability of carrying it but such     influence as argument and statement without profession of     political intentions can exercise upon the public mind i heartily     desire to see exercised in favour of extension of the     franchise   on the following day lord palmerston wrote to him “i have no doubt that you have yourself heard a great deal about the bad effect of your speech but i can assure you that i hear from many quarters the unfavourable impression it has produced even upon many of the liberal party and upon all persons who value the maintenance of our institutions”  to others mr gladstone wrote in less formal style for instance to an eminent nonconformist minister “may 14 i have unwarily it seems set the thames on fire but i have great hopes that the thames will on reflection perceive that he had no business or title to catch the flame and will revert to his ordinary temperature accordingly” and to his brother robertson he writes from brighton three days later—       many thanks for all you say respecting my speech on the franchise     bill i have been astounded to find it the cause or occasion of     such a row it would have been quite as intelligible to me had     people said “under the exceptions of personal unfitness and     political danger you exclude or may exclude almost everybody and     you reduce your declaration to a shadow”   in the diary he says “may 11—spoke on the franchise bill some sensation it appears to me that it was due less to me than to the change in the hearers and in the public mind from the professions at least if not the principles of 1859” much against lord palmerston’s wish the speech was published with a short preface that even staunch friends like phillimore found obscure and not well written  m38 an address significant of the general feeling in the unenfranchised classes was presented to him from the workmen of york a month after his speech in parliament they recalled his services to free trade when he stood by the side of peel his budget of 1860 his conspicuous and honourable share in abolishing the taxes on knowledge “we have marked” they said “your manifestations of sympathy with the downtrodden and oppressed of every clime you have advanced the cause of freedom in foreign lands by the power and courage with which you have assailed and exposed the misdeeds and cruelties of continental tyrants to the provident operative you have by your post office savings bank bill given security for his small savings and your government annuities bill of this session is a measure which will stimulate the people to greater thrift and forethought these acts together with your speeches on the last named and on the borough franchise bill make up a life that commands our lasting gratitude” such was the new popular estimate of him in framing his reply to this address mr gladstone did his best to discourage the repetition of like performances from other places he submitted the draft to lord palmerston and followed his advice in omitting certain portions of it it was reduced to the conventional type of such acknowledgment    iii   in the autumn of 1864 mr gladstone made a series of speeches in his native county which again showed the sincerity and the simplicity of his solicitude for the masses of his countrymen the sentiment is common mr disraeli and the young englanders had tried to inscribe it upon a party banner twenty years before but mr gladstone had given proof that he knew how to embody sentiment in acts of parliament and he associated it with the broadest ideas of citizenship and policy these speeches were not a manifesto or a programme they were a survey of the principles of the statesmanship that befitted the period  at bolton oct 11 he discoursed to audiences of the working class upon the progress of thirty years with such freshness of spirit as awoke energetic hopes of the progress for the thirty years that were to follow the next day he opened a park with words from the heart about the modern sense of the beauties of nature the greeks he said however much beauty they might have discerned in nature had no sympathy with the delight in detached natural objects—a tree or a stream or a hill—which was so often part of the common life of the poorest englishman even a century or less ago “communion with nature” would have sounded an affected and unnatural phrase now it was a sensible part of the life of the working classes then came moralising at that date less trite than it has since become about the social ties that ought to mark the relations between master and workman  m39 the same night at a banquet in liverpool and two days later at manchester he advanced to high imperial ground he told them how after an experience now becoming long the one standing pain to the political man in england is a sense of the inequality of his best exertions to the arduous duty of government and legislation england had undertaken responsibilities of empire such as never before lay on the shoulders or the minds of men we governed distant millions many times outnumbering ourselves we were responsible for the welfare of forty or fortyfive separate states again what other nation was charged with the same responsibility in the exercise of its moral influence abroad in the example it is called upon to set in the sympathy it must feel with the cause of right and justice and constitutional freedom wherever that cause is at issue as for our fellow subjects abroad we had given them practical freedom it was our duty to abstain as far as may be from interference with their affairs to afford them the shelter and protection of the empire and at the same time to impress upon them that there is no grosser mistake in politics than to suppose you can separate the blessings and benefits of freedom from its burdens in other words the colonies should pay their own way and if the old dream of making their interests subservient to those of the mother country had passed away it was just as little reasonable that the mother country should bear charges that in equity belonged to them and all the more if the colonies set up against the industry and productions of england the mischiefs and obstructions of an exploded protective system on foreign policy he enforced the principles that after all had given to europe forty years of peace and to england forty years of diplomatic authority and preeminence “it is impossible that to a country like england the affairs of foreign nations can ever be indifferent it is impossible that england in my opinion ever should forswear the interest she must naturally feel in the cause of truth of justice of order and of good government” the final word was an admonition against “political lethargy” for the first time i think he put into the forefront the tormenting question that was to haunt him to the end “they could not look at ireland” he told them “and say that the state of feeling there was for the honour and the advantage of the united kingdom”       oct 14 ’64—so ended in peace an exhausting flattering i     hope not intoxicating circuit god knows i have not courted them     i hope i do not rest on them i pray i may turn them to account     for good it is however impossible not to love the people from     whom such manifestations come as meet me in every quarter     somewhat haunted by dreams of halls and lines of people and     great assemblies   it was observed of this lancashire tour by critics who hardly meant to praise him that he paid his hearers the high compliment of assuming that they could both understand his arguments and feel his appeal to their moral sympathies his speeches men said were in fact lay sermons of a high order as skilfully composed as accurately expressed as if they were meant for the house of commons this was singularly true and what an eulogy it was for our modern british democracy that the man whom they made their first great hero was an orator of such a school lord lyttelton his brotherinlaw informed him of the alarm and odium that his new line of policy was raising mr gladstone april 1865 replied “after all you are a peer and peel used to say speaking of his peer colleagues that they were beings of a different order please to recollect that we have got to govern millions of hard hands that it must be done by force fraud or good will that the latter has been tried and is answering that none have profited more by this change of system since the corn law and the six acts than those who complain of it as to their misliking me i have no fault to find with them for that it is the common lot in similar circumstances and the very things that i have done or omitted doing from my extreme and almost irrational reluctance to part company with them become an aggravation when the parting is accomplished” “gladstone i think” says bishop wilberforce dec 7 “is certainly gaining power you hear now almost every one say he must be the future premier and such sayings tend greatly to accomplish themselves”    iv   m40 it was about this time that mr gladstone first found himself drawing to relations with the protestant dissenters that were destined to grow closer as years went on these relations had no small share in the extension of his public power perhaps too no small share in the more abiding work upon the dissenters themselves of enlarging what was narrow softening what was hard and bitter and promoting a healing union where the existence of a church establishment turned ecclesiastical differences into lines of social division he had alarmed his friends by his action on a measure april 15 1863 for remedying an old grievance about the burial of dissenters having served on a select committee appointed in the rather quixotic hope that a solution of the difficulty might be found by the somewhat unparliamentary means of “friendly conversation among candid and impartial men” he had convinced himself that there was a wrong to be set right and he voted and spoke accordingly “it will most rudely shake his oxford seat” says phillimore the peril there was becoming daily more apparent then in 1864 and on later occasions he met leading nonconformist clergy at the house of mr newman hall—such men as binney allon edward white baldwin brown henry reynolds and that most admirable friend citizen and man rw dale so well known as dale of birmingham their general attitude was described by mr newman hall as this they hoped for the ultimate recognition of the free church theory and meditated no political action to bring it about they looked for it to come as the result of influence within the church of england not of efforts from without “many dissenters” one of them told him nov 20 1864 “would enter the church whatever their theory about establishment if such slight modifications were made as would allow them to do so conscientiously—holding the essentials of the faith far more soundly than many within the established church” another regretted after one of these gatherings that they never got to the core of the subject “namely that there run through the prayerbook from beginning to end ideas that are not accepted by numbers who subscribe and which cannot all be admitted by any one”  all this once more brought mr gladstone into a curious position just as at oxford he had in 1847 been the common hope of ultraclericals on one hand and ultraliberals on the other so now he was the common hope of the two antagonistic schools of religious comprehension—the right who looked towards the formularies system discipline and tradition either of the orthodox church or the latin and the left who sought reunion on the basis of puritanism with a leaven of modern criticism always the devoted friend of dr pusey and his school he was gradually welcomed as ally and political leader by men like dale and allon the independents and spurgeon the baptist on the broad ground that it was possible for all good men to hold amid their differences about church government the more vital sympathies and charities of their common profession they even sounded him on one occasion about laying the foundation stone of one of their chapels the broad result of such intercourse of the nonconformist leaders with this powerful and generous mind enriched by historic knowledge and tradition strengthened by high political responsibility deepened by meditations long strenuous and systematic was indeed remarkable dr allon expressed it with admirable point in a letter to him some fourteen years after our present date april 15 1878—       the kind of intercourse that you have kindly permitted with     nonconformists has helped more consciously to identify them with     movements of national life and to diminish the stern feeling of     almost defiant witnessbearing that was strong a generation or two     ago it is something gained if ecclesiastical and political     differences can he debated within a common circle of social     confidence and identity their confidence in you has made them     amenable to your lead in respect of methods and movements needing     the guidance of political insight and experience    v   a man’s mind seldom moves forward towards light and freedom on a single line and in mr gladstone’s case the same impulses that made him tolerant of formal differences as to church government led slowly to a still wider liberality in respect of far deeper differences readers may remember the shock with which in his youth he found that one person or another was a unitarian to mr darbishire a member of the unitarian body who was for many years his friend he wrote about some address of james martineau’s dec 21 1862—       from time to time i have read works of mr martineau’s or works     that i have taken for his with great admiration with warm     respect for the writer and moreover with a great deal of     sympathy i should greatly like to make his acquaintance but     attached as i am to the old christian dogma and believing it as i     do or rather believing the person whom it sets forth to be the     real fountain of all the gifts and graces that are largely strewn     over society and in which mr martineau himself seems so amply to     share i fear i am separated from him in the order of ideas by an     interval that must be called a gulf my conviction is that the old     creeds have been and are to be the channel by which the     christian religion is made a reality even for many who do not hold     it and i think that when we leave them we shall leave them not     for something better but something worse hence you will not be     surprised that i regard some of mr martineau’s propositions as     unhistorical and untrue   and to the same gentleman a year or two later jan 2 1865—       i am sorry to say i have not yet been able to read mr martineau’s     sermon which i mean to do with care i am as you know one     altogether attached to dogma which i believe to be the skeleton     that carries the flesh the blood the life of the blessed thing     we call the christian religion but i do not believe that god’s     tender mercies are restricted to a small portion of the human     family i dare not be responsible for dr newman nor would he     thank me but i hope he does not so believe and this the more     because i have lately been reading dr manning’s letter to dr     pusey and though dr manning is far more exaggerated in his     religion than dr newman and seems to me almost to caricature it     yet i think even he has by no means that limited view of the     mercies of god      i have no mental difficulty in reconciling a belief in the church     and what may be called the high christian doctrine with that     comforting persuasion that those who do not receive the greatest     blessings and each man must believe his religion to be greatest     are notwithstanding the partakers each in his measure of other     gifts and will be treated according to their use of them i admit     there are schools of christians who think otherwise i was myself     brought up to think otherwise and to believe that salvation     depended absolutely upon the reception of a particular and a very     narrow creed but long long have i cast those weeds behind me     unbelief may in given conditions be a moral offence and only as     such only like other disobedience and on like principles can it     be punishable   to not a few the decisive change in mr gladstone’s mental history is the change from the “very narrow creed” of his youth to the “high christian doctrine” of his after life still more will regard as the real transition the attainment of this “comforting persuasion” this last word of benignity and tolerance here we are on the foundations tolerance is far more than the abandonment of civil usurpations over conscience it is a lesson often needed quite as much in the hearts of a minority as of a majority tolerance means reverence for all the possibilities of truth it means acknowledgment that she dwells in diverse mansions and wears vesture of many colours and speaks in strange tongues it means frank respect for freedom of indwelling conscience against mechanic forms official conventions social force it means the charity that is greater than even faith and hope marked is the day for a man when he can truly say as mr gladstone here said “long long have i cast those weeds behind me”     chapter ix defeat at oxford—death of lord palmerston—parliamentary leadership 1865       in public life a man of elevated mind does not make his own self     tell upon others simply and entirely he must act with other men     he cannot select his objects or pursue them by means     unadulterated by the methods and practices of minds less elevated     than his own he can only do what he feels to be secondbest he     labours at a venture prosecuting measures so large or so     complicated that their ultimate issue is uncertain—cardinal     newman    i   the faithful steward is a chartered bore alike of the mimic and the working stage the rake and spendthrift carries all before him nobody knew better than mr gladstone that of all the parts in public life the teasing and economising drudge is the most thankless the public only half apprehends or refuses to apprehend at all his spending colleagues naturally fight colleagues who do not spend have other business and prize a quiet life all this made mr gladstone’s invincible tenacity as guardian of the national accounts the more genuinely heroic in a long letter from balmoral in the october of 1864 he began what was destined to be the closing battle of the six years’ war to mrs gladstone he wrote—       i have fired off today my letter to lord palmerston about     expenditure for a long time though i did not let myself worry by     needlessly thinking about it i have had it lying on me like a     nightmare i mean it to be moderate i shall have the copy when we     meet to show you but unless he concurs it may lead to     consequences between this time and february what is really     painful is to believe that he will not agree unless through     apprehension his own leanings and desires being in favour of a     large and not a moderate expenditure   figures details points were varied but the issue was in essence the same and the end was much the same lord palmerston took his stand on the demands of public opinion he insisted oct 19 that anybody who looked carefully at the signs of the times must see that there were at present two strong feelings in the national mind—the one a disinclination to organic changes in our representative system the other a steady determination that the country should be placed and kept in an efficient condition of defence he pointed to the dead indifference of the workmen themselves to their own enfranchisement as evidence of the one and to the volunteer movement as evidence of the other  mr gladstone rejoined that it was lord palmerston’s personal popularity and not the conviction or desire of the nation that kept up estimates palmerston retorted that this was to mistake cause and effect “if i have in any degree been fortunate enough to have obtained some share of the goodwill and confidence of my fellowcountrymen it has been because i have rightly understood the feelings and opinion of the nation you may depend upon it that any degree of popularity that is worth having can be obtained only by such means and of that popularity i sincerely wish you the most ample share” the strain was severe—       oct 1 1864—i still feel much mental lassitude and not only     shrink from public business but from hard books it is uphill     work oct 21—a pamphlet letter from lord palmerston about     defence holds out a dark prospect oct 22—wrote late in the     day my reply to lord palmerston in a rather decisive tone for i     feel conscious of right and of necessity      to mrs gladstone      nov 9—after more than a fortnight’s delay i received     yesterday evening the enclosed very unfavourable letter from lord     palmerston i send with it the draft of my reply please to return     them tomorrow by willy—for they ought not to be even for that     short time out of my custody but i do not like to keep you in the     dark i suppose the matter may now stand over as far as debate is     concerned until next month or even till the middle of january i     fear you will not have much time for reading or writing tomorrow     before you start for chatsworth      this sort of controversy keeps the nerves too highly strung i     am more afraid of running away than of holding my ground but i do     not quite forget how plentifully i am blessed and sustained and     how mercifully spared other and sorer trials      tomorrow comes the supper of the st martin’s volunteers and     after that i hope to close my lips until february the scene last     night97 was very different from that of monday but very     remarkable and even more enthusiastic i was the only layman     among five hundred lawyers and it made me wickedly think of my     position when locked alone in the naples gaol      jan 19 1865—the cabinet has been today almost as rough as     any of the roughest times in regard to the navy estimates i have     had no effective or broad support platoonfiring more or less in     my sense from argyll and gibson four or five were silent the     rest hostile probably they will appoint a committee of cabinet     and we may work through but on the other hand we may not my     opinion is manifestly in a minority but there is an     unwillingness to have a row i am not well able to write about     other things—these batterings are sore work but i must go     through c paget and childers hold their ground      jan 28—the morning went fast but wretchedly seldom thank     god have i a day to which i could apply this epithet last night     i could have done almost anything to shut out the thought of the     coming battle this is very weak but it is the effects of the     constant recurrence of these things estimates always settled at     the dagger’s point—diary      osborne jan 31—i hope you got my note last night the weather     here is mild and i sit with open window while writing the queen     and princess both ask about you abundantly i have been most     pertinacious about seeing the baby prince i tried to make the     request twice to the princess but i think she did not understand     my words determined not to be beat i applied to the prince who     acceded with glee but i don’t know what will come of it he     talked with good sense last night about greece ionian islands     and canada and i was his partner at whist we came off quits i     dined last night and also saw the queen before dinner but only     for a quarter of an hour or so she talked about japan and lord     palmerston but there was not time to get into swing and nothing     said of nearer matters   the sort of success that awaited his strenuous endeavour has been already indicated98    ii   in the spring mr gladstone made the first advance upon what was to be an important journey all through february and march he worked with phillimore and others upon the question of the irish church the thing was delicate for his constituency would undoubtedly be adverse his advisers resolved that he should speak on a certain motion from a radical below the gangway to the effect that the present position of the irish church establishment was unsatisfactory and called for the early attention of the government it is hard to imagine two propositions on the merits more indisputable but a parliamentary resolution is not to be judged by its verbal contents only dillwyn’s motion was known to mean disestablishment and nothing less in that view mr gladstone wrote a short but pregnant letter to phillimore—and this too meant disestablishment and nothing less it was the first tolerably definite warning of what was to be one of the two or three greatest legislative acts of his career       to robert phillimore      feb 13 1865—i would treat the irish church as a religious     body with the same respect and consideration as the church of     england and would apply to it the same liberal policy as regards     its freedom of action but i am not loyal to it as an     establishment it exists and is virtually almost unchallenged as     to its existence in that capacity it may long i cannot quite say     long may it outlive me i will never be a party knowingly to     what i may call frivolous acts of disturbance nor to the     premature production of schemes of change but still comes back     the refrain of my song “i am not loyal to it as an     establishment” i could not renew the votes and speeches of     thirty years back a quarter of a century of not only fair but     exceptionally fair trial has wholly dispelled hopes to which they     had relation and i am bound to say i look upon its present form     of existence as no more favourable to religion in any sense of     the word than it is to civil justice and to the contentment and     loyalty of ireland   lord palmerston got wind of the forthcoming speech and wrote a short admonitory note he had heard that mr gladstone was about to set forth his views as an individual and not as a member of the government and this was a distinction that he reckoned impracticable was it possible for a member of a government speaking from the treasury bench so to sever himself from the body corporate to which he belonged as to be able to express decided opinions as an individual and leave himself free to act upon different opinions or abstain from acting on those opinions when required to act as a member of the government taking part in the divisions of the body and again if his opinions happened not to be accepted by a colleague on the same bench would not the colleague have either to acquiesce or else to state in what respect his own opinion differed in this case would not differences in a government be unnecessarily and prematurely forced upon the public all this was the sound doctrine of cabinet government mr gladstone replying felt that “he could not as a minister and as member for oxford allow the subject to be debated an indefinite number of times and remain silent” his indictment of the irish church was decisive at the same time he was careful to explain in public correspondence that the question was out of all bearing on the practical politics of the day meanwhile as spokesman for the government mr gladstone deprecated the responsibility of raising great questions at a time when they could not be seriously approached one acute observer who knew him well evidently took a different view of the practical politics of the day or at any rate of the morrow manning wrote to mr gladstone two days after the speech was made and begged to be allowed to see him “i read your speech on the irish church which set me musing and forecasting it was a real grapple with the question”    iii   m41 not many days after this speech cobden died to his brother robertson mr gladstone wrote—       april 5—what a sad sad loss is this death of cobden i feel in     miniature the truth of what bright well said yesterday—ever since     i really came to know him i have held him in high esteem and     regard as well as admiration but till he died i did not know how     high it was i do not know that i have ever seen in public life a     character more truly simple noble and unselfish his death will     make an echo through the world which in its entireness he has     served so well      april 7—to mr cobden’s funeral at w lavington afterwards to     his home which i was anxious to know also i saw mrs cobden the     day was lovely the scenery most beautiful and soothing the whole     sad and impressive bright broke down at the grave cobden’s name     is great it will be greater—diary   a few months before this mr gladstone had lost a friend more intimate the death of the duke of newcastle he says oct 19 1864 “severs the very last of those contemporaries who were also my political friends how it speaks to me ‘be doing and be done’ ”       to mrs gladstone      oct 19—dr kingsley sent me a telegram to inform me of the sad     event at clumber but it only arrived two hours before the papers     though the death happened last night so that brave heart has at     last ceased to beat certainly in him more than in any one i have     known was exhibited the character of our life as a dispensation     of pain this must ever be a mystery for we cannot see the     workingout of the purposes of god yet in his case i have always     thought some glimpse of them seemed to be permitted it is well to     be permitted also to believe that he is now at rest for ever and     that the cloud is at length removed from his destiny      clumber oct 26—it is a time and a place to feel if one could     feel he died in the room where we have been sitting before and     after dinner—where thirtytwo years ago a stripling i came over     from newark in fear and trembling to see the duke his father     where a stiff horseshoe semicircle then sat round the fire in     evenings where that rigour melted away in lady lincoln’s time     where she and her mother sang so beautifully at the pianoforte in     the same place where it now stands the house is full of local     memories    iv   on july 6 1865 parliament was dissolved four years before mr gladstone had considered the question of retaining or abandoning the seat for the university it was in contemplation to give a third member to the southern division of lancashire and in july 1861 he received a requisition begging his assent to nomination there signed by nearly 8000 of the electors—a number that seemed to make success certain his letters to dr pusey and others show how strongly he inclined to comply flesh and blood shrank from perpetual strife he thought and after four contested elections in fourteen years at oxford he asked himself whether he should not escape the prolongation of the series he saw as he said that they meant to make it a lifebattle like the old famous college war between bentley and the fellows of trinity but he felt his deep obligation to his oxford supporters and was honourably constrained again to bear their flag in the same month of 1861 he had declined absolutely to stand for london in the place of lord john russell  at oxford the tories this time had secured an excellent candidate in mr gathorne hardy a man of sterling character a bold and capable debater a good man of business one of the best of lord derby’s lieutenants the election was hard fought like most of the four that had gone before it the educated residents were for the chancellor of the exchequer as they had always been and he had both liberals and high churchmen on his side one feature was novel the power of sending votes by post mr gladstone had not been active in the house against this change but only bestowed upon it a parting malediction it strengthened the clerical vote and as sympathy with disestablishment was thrust prominently forward against mr gladstone the new privilege cost him his seat from the first day things looked ill and when on the last day july 18 the battle ended he was one hundred and eighty votes behind mr hardy99       july 16 ’65—always in straits the bible in church supplies my     needs today it was in the 1st lesson jer i 19 “and they     shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee     for i am with thee saith the lord to deliver thee”      july 17—again came consolation to me in the psalms—8616 it     did the same for me april 17 1853 at night arrived the telegram     announcing my defeat at oxford as virtually accomplished a dear     dream is dispelled god’s will be done   m42 his valedictory address was both graceful and sincere “after an arduous connection of eighteen years i bid you respectfully farewell my earnest purpose to serve you my many faults and shortcomings the incidents of the political relation between the university and myself established in 1847 so often questioned in vain and now at length finally dissolved i leave to the judgment of the future it is one imperative duty and one alone which induces me to trouble you with these few parting words—the duty of expressing my profound and lasting gratitude for indulgence as generous and for support as warm and enthusiastic in itself and as honourable from the character and distinctions of those who have given it as has in my belief ever been accorded by any constituency to any representative”  he was no sooner assured of his repulse at oxford than he started for the lancashire constituency where a nomination had been reserved for him       july 18—went off at eleven  to the free trade hall which was     said to have 6000 people they were in unbounded enthusiasm i     spoke for 114 hr and when the meeting concluded went off to     liverpool another meeting of 5000 at the amphitheatre if     possible more enthusiastic than that at manchester   in the fine hall that stands upon the site made historic by the militant freetraders he used a memorable phrase “at last my friends” he began “i am come among you and i am come among you ‘unmuzzled’ ” the audience quickly realised the whole strength of the phrase and so did the people of the country when it reached them then he opened a high magnanimous exordium about the oxford that had cast him out the same evening at liverpool he again dwelt on the desperate fondness with which he had clung to the university seat but rapidly passed to the contrast “i come into south lancashire and find here around me different phenomena i find the development of industry i find the growth of enterprise i find the progress of social philanthropy i find the prevalence of toleration i find an ardent desire for freedom if there be one duty more than another incumbent upon the public men of england it is to establish and maintain harmony between the past of our glorious history and the future that is still in store for her”       july 20—robertson and i went in early and polled he was known     and i through him and we had a scene of great popular enthusiasm     we then followed the polls as the returns came in apparently     triumphant but about midday it appeared that the figures of both     parties were wrong ours the worst instead of being well and     increasingly at the head i was struggling with egerton at 1 pm     and turner gaining on me off to chester in the evening the     figures of the close came in and gave me the second place the     volunteers in the park cheered loudly the church bells rung the     people came down with a band and i had to address them      to the duchess of sutherland      i am by far too sorry about oxford to feel the slightest     temptation to be angry even were there cause i only feel that i     love her better than ever there is great enthusiasm here     stimulated no doubt by the rejection i have just been polling     amid fervid demonstrations the first return at nine o’clock—but     you will know all when this reaches you—is as follows this of     course says little as to the final issue ten o’clock my majority     so far increases the others diminish but it is hard running     eleven my majority increases the others diminish egerton is     second one of our men third twelve thousand four hundred have     polled my seat looks well      i interrupt here to say you would have been pleased had you     heard willy at a moment’s notice on tuesday night address five     thousand people no one of whom had ever seen him he was forgive     me so modest so manly so ready so judicious      since writing thus far everything has been overset in a chaos of     conflicting reports they will all be cleared up for you before     this comes i hope i am not in a fool’s paradise all i yet know     is an apparently hard fight between egerton and me for the head of     the poll but my seat tolerably secure i have had such letters   when the votes were counted mr gladstone was third upon the poll and so secured the seat with two tory colleagues above him100  the spirit in which mr gladstone took a defeat that was no mere electioneering accident but the landmark of a great severance in his extraordinary career is shown in his replies to multitudes of correspondents on the side of his tenacious and affectionate attachment to oxford the wound was deep on the other side emancipation from fetters and from contests that he regarded as ungenerous was a profound relief but the relief touched him less than the sorrow  manning wrote—       few men have been watching you more than i have in these last     days and i do not know that i could wish you any other result     but you have entered upon a new and larger field as sir it peel     did to whose history yours has many points of likeness you say     truly that oxford has failed to enlarge itself to the progress of     the country i hope this will make you enlarge yourself to the     facts of our age and state—and i believe it will only as i said     some months ago i am anxious about you lest you should entangle     yourself with extremes this crisis is for you politically what a     certain date was for me religiously   mr gladstone replied—       hawarden july 21—i thank you very much for your kind letter     and i should have been very glad if it had contained all that it     merely alludes to from oxford and her children i am overwhelmed     with kindness my feelings towards her are those of sorrow     leavened perhaps with pride but i am for the moment a stunned     man the more so because without a moment of repose i had to     plunge into the whirlpools of south lancashire and swim there for     my life which as you will see has been given me      i do not think i can admit the justice of the caution against     extremes the greatest or second greatest of what people call my     extremes is one which i believe you approve i profess myself a     disciple of butler the greatest of all enemies to extremes this     indeed speaks for my intention only but in a cold or lukewarm     period and such is this in public affairs everything which moves     and lives is called extreme and that by the very people i do not     mean or think that you are one of them who in a period of     excitement would far outstrip under pressure those whom they now     rebuke your caution about selfcontrol however i do accept—it     is very valuable—i am sadly lacking in that great quality      at both liverpool and manchester he writes to dr jacobson i had     to speak of oxford and i have endeavoured to make it     unequivocally clear that i am here as the same man and not     another and that throwing off the academic cap and gown makes no     difference in the figure      “vixi et quem dederat cursum fortuna peregi”101      and when i think of dear old oxford whose services to me i can     never repay there comes back to me that line of wordsworth in his     incomparable ode and i fervently address her with it—      “forbode not any severing of our loves”      to sir stafford northcote july 21—i cannot withhold myself     from writing a line to assure you it is not my fault but my     misfortune that you are not my successor at oxford my desire or     impulse has for a good while not unnaturally been to escape from     the oxford seat not because i grudged the anxieties of it but     because i found the load added to other loads too great could i     have seen my way to this proceeding had the advice or had the     conduct of my friends warranted it you would have had such notice     of it as effectually to preclude your being anticipated i mean     no disrespect to mr hardy but it has been a great pain to me to     see in all the circulars a name different from the name that     should have stood there and that would have stood there but for     your personal feelings      ibid july 22—the separation from friends in politics is indeed     very painful i have been instructed perhaps been hardened by     a very wide experience in separation—no man has been blessed more     out of proportion to his deserts than i have in friends in     πολυφιλία in χρηστοφιλία102 but when with regard to those of     old standing who were nearest to me i ask where are they i seem     to see around me a little waste that has been made by politics     by religion and by death all these modes of severance are sharp     but the first of them is the least so when the happy conviction     remains that the fulfilment of duty such as conscience points to     it is the object on both sides and i have suffered so sorely by     the far sharper partings in death and in religion after a fashion     which practically almost comes to death that there is something     of relief in turning to the lighter visitation it is however a     visitation still      to the bishop of oxford july 21— do not join with others in     praising me because i am not angry only sorry and that deeply     for my revenge—which i do not desire but would battle if i     could—all lies in that little word “future” in my address which i     wrote with a consciousness that it is deeply charged with meaning     and that that which shall come will come there have been two     great deaths or transmigrations of spirit in my political     existence one very slow the breaking of ties with my original     party the other very short and sharp the breaking of the tie     with oxford there will probably be a third and no more     again my dear bishop i thank you for bearing with my     waywardness and manifesting in the day of need your confidence     and attachment   the bishop naturally hinted some curiosity as to the third transmigration “the oracular sentence” mr gladstone replied “has little bearing on present affairs or prospects and may stand in its proper darkness” in the same letter the bishop urged mr gladstone to imitate canning when he claimed the post of prime minister “i think” was the reply july 25 “that if you had the same means of estimating my position jointly with my faculties as i have you would be of a different opinion it is my fixed determination never to take any step whatever to raise myself to a higher level in official life and this not on grounds of christian selfdenial which would hardly apply but on the double ground first of my total ignorance of my capacity bodily or mental to hold such a higher level and secondly—perhaps i might say especially—because i am certain that the fact of my seeking it would seal my doom in taking it”103  truly was it said of mr gladstone that his rejection at oxford and his election in lancashire were regarded as matters of national importance because he was felt to have the promise of the future in him to have a living fire in him a capacity for action and a belief that moving on was a national necessity because he was bold earnest impulsive because he could sympathise with men of all classes occupations interests opinions because he thought nothing done so long as much remained for him to do while liberals thus venerated him as if he had been a moses beckoning from sinai towards the promised land tories were described as dreading him ever since his suffrage speech as continental monarchs dreaded mazzini—“a man whose name is at once an alarm a menace and a prediction” they hated him partly as a deserter partly as a disciple of manchester throughout the struggle the phrase “i believe in mr gladstone” served as the liberal credo and “i distrust mr gladstone” as the condensed commination service of the tories upon all manner of change104    v   m43 on october 18 the prime minister died at brocket the news found mr gladstone at clumber in performance of his duties as newcastle trustee for him the event opened many possibilities and his action upon it is set out in two or three extracts from his letters—       to lord russell clumber oct 18 1865—i have received tonight     by telegraph the appalling news of lord palmerston’s decease none     of us i suppose were prepared for this event in the sense of     having communicated as to what should follow the queen must take     the first step but i cannot feel uncertain what it will be your     former place as her minister your powers experience services     and renown do not leave reason for doubt that you will be sent     for your hands will be entirely free—you are pledged probably to     no one certainly not to me but any government now to be formed     cannot be wholly a continuation it must be in some degree a new     commencement      i am sore with conflicts about the public expenditure which i     feel that other men would have either escaped or have conducted     more gently and less fretfully i am most willing to retire on     the other hand i am bound by conviction even more than by credit     to the principle of progressive reduction in our military and     naval establishments and in the charges for them under the     favourable circumstances which we appear to enjoy this i think is     the moment to say thus much in subject matter which greatly     appertains to my department on the general field of politics     after having known your course in cabinet for eight and a half     years i am quite willing to take my chance under your banner in     the exact capacity i now fill and i adopt the step perhaps a     little unusual of saying so because it may be convenient to you     at a juncture when time is precious while it can i trust after     what i have said above hardly be hurtful      to mr panizzi oct 18—ei fu105 death has indeed laid low     the most towering antlers in all the forest no man in england     will more sincerely mourn lord palmerston than you your warm     heart your long and close friendship with him and your sense of     all he had said and done for italy all so bound you to him that     you will deeply feel this loss as for myself i am stunned it was     plain that this would come but sufficient unto the day is the     burden thereof and there is no surplus stock of energy in the     mind to face far less to anticipate fresh contingencies but i     need not speak of this great event—tomorrow all england will be     ringing of it and the world will echo england i cannot forecast     the changes which will follow but it is easy to see what the     first step should be      to mrs gladstone oct 20—i received two letters from you     today together the first very naturally full of plans the     second written when those plans had been blown into the air by the     anticipation even of lord palmerston’s death this great event     shakes me down to the foundation by the reason of coming trouble     i think two things are clear 1 the queen should have come to     london 2 she should have sent for lord russell i fear she has     done neither willy telegraphs to me that a letter from lord     russell had come to downing street now had he heard from the     queen he would so i reason either have telegraphed to me to go     up or sent a letter hither by a messenger instead of leaving it     to kick its heels in downing street for a day and we hear nothing     of the queen’s moving she is getting into a groove out of which     some one ought to draw her      oct 21—as far as political matters are concerned i am happier     this morning lord russell pleased with my letter writes to say     he has been commissioned to carry on the present government as     first lord wishes me to cooperate “in the capacity i now fill as     a principal member of the administration” i think that i have     struck a stroke for economy which will diminish difficulty when we     come to estimates for the year i hope from his letter that he     means to ask george grey to lead which would be very acceptable     to me though he does not summon me to london i think i ought to     go and shall do so accordingly today i am sorry that this is     again more vexation and uncertainty for you      oct 22—i came up last night and very glad i am of it i found     that lord palmerston’s funeral was almost to be private not     because the family wished it but because nothing had been     proposed to them i at once sent—down to richmond and pembroke     lodge with a letter and the result is that evelyn ashley has been     written to by lord russell and authorised to telegraph to balmoral     to propose a funeral in westminster abbey it is now very late     and all the preparations must have been made at romsey but in     such a matter especially better late than never      you will have been amused to see that on friday the times     actually put me up for prime minister and yesterday knocked me     down again there is a rumour that it was the old story delane     out of town i was surprised at the first article not at the     second all i am sorry to say seem to take for granted that i am     to lead the house of commons but this is not so simple a matter     first it must be offered to sir george grey if he refuses then     secondly i do not think i can get on without a different     arrangement of treasury and chancellor of exchequer business     which will not be easy but the worst of all is the distribution     of offices as between the two houses it has long been felt that     the house of commons was too weak and the house of lords too     strong in the share of the important offices and now the     premiership is to be carried over unavoidably no such thing has     ever been known as an administration with the first lord foreign     secretary secretary for war and the first lord of the admiralty     in the house of lords106 this is really a stiff business      to lord russell carlton house terrace oct 23—you having     thought fit to propose that i should lead the house of commons i     felt it necessary first to be assured that sir george grey who     was in constructive possession of that office and under whom i     should have served with perfect satisfaction could not be induced     to accept the duty of this your letter seemed to contain     sufficient proof next i felt it to be necessary that some     arrangement should be made for relieving me of a considerable and     singularly disabling class of business consisting of the cases of     real or supposed grievance at all times arising in connection     with the collection of the public revenue under its several     heads the third difficulty which i named to you in the way of     my accepting your proposal is what i venture to call the     lopsided condition of the government with the strain and stress     of administration in the house of commons and nearly all the     offices about which the house of commons cares represented by     heads in the house of lords it weighs very seriously on my mind     and i beg you to consider it i have rather particular     engagements of a public nature next week at edinburgh on the 2nd     and 3rd in connection with the university business and at glasgow     on the 1st to receive the freedom i am anxious to know whether i     may now finally confirm these engagements      to mrs gladstone oct 23—i think i see my way a little now     lord russell agrees that cabinets should be postponed after     saturday for a good fortnight i can therefore keep my     engagements in scotland and write today to say so      lord palmerston is to be buried in the abbey on friday the family     are pleased i saw w cowper as well as evelyn ashley today they     give a good account of lady palmerston lord russell offers me     the lead—i must probably settle it tomorrow his physical     strength is low but i suppose in the lords he may get on the     greatest difficulty is having almost all the important offices in     the lords      oct 24—lord russell now proposes to adjourn the cabinets till     nov14th but i must be here for the lord mayor’s dinner on the     9th you will therefore see my programme as it now stands i send     you a batch of eight letters which please keep carefully to     yourself and return in their bundle forthwith there are divers     proposals on foot but i think little will be finally settled     before friday sir r peel will probably have a peerage offered     him i have not yet accepted the lead formally but i suppose it     must come to that the main question is whether anything and     what can be done to improve the structure of the government as     between the two houses      oct 25—nothing more has yet been done i consider my position     virtually fixed i am afraid of lord russell’s rapidity but we     shall try to rein it in there seems to be very little venom in     the atmosphere i wish sir g grey were here the queen’s keeping     so long at balmoral is a sad mistake   m44 he received as was inevitable plenty of letters from admirers regretting that he had not gone up higher his answer was of course uniform “it was” he told them “my own impartial and firm opinion that lord russell was the proper person to succeed lord palmerston however flattered i may be therefore to hear of an opinion such as you report and express i have felt it my duty to cooperate to the best of my power in such arrangements as might enable the government to be carried on by the present ministers with lord russell at their head”  on the other hand doubts were abundant to sir george grey one important friend wrote oct 30 “i think you are right on the score of health to give him gladstone the lead of the house but you will see with all his talents he will not perceive the difference between leading and driving” another correspondent of special experience confessed to “great misgivings as to gladstone’s tact and judgment” “the heart of all israel is towards him” wrote his good friend dean church “he is very great and very noble but he is hated as much as or more than he is loved he is fierce sometimes and wrathful and easily irritated he wants knowledge of men and speaks rashly and i look on with some trembling to see what will come of this his first attempt to lead the commons and prove himself fit to lead england”107 it was pointed out that roundell palmer was the only powerful auxiliary on whom he could rely in debate and should the leader himself offend the house by an indiscretion no colleague was competent to cover his retreat or baffle the triumph of the enemy his first public appearance as leader of the house of commons and associate premier was made at glasgow and his friends were relieved and exultant the point on which they trembled was caution and at glasgow he was caution personified  the changes in administration were not very difficult lowe’s admission to the cabinet was made impossible by his declaration against any lowering of the borough franchise the inclusion of mr goschen who had only been in parliament three years was the subject of remark people who asked what he had done to merit promotion so striking did not know his book on foreign exchanges and were perhaps in no case competent to judge it108 something seems to have been said about mr bright for in a note to lord russell dec 11 mr gladstone writes “with reference to your remark about bright he has for many years held language of a studious moderation about reform and there is something odious in fighting shy of a man so powerful in talent of such undoubted integrity without feeling however that he is permanently proscribed i am under the impression that in the present critical state of feeling on your own side with respect to the franchise his name would sink the government and the bill together” when palmerston invited cobden to join his cabinet in 1859 cobden spoke of bright how he had avoided personalities in his recent speeches “it is not personalities that we complained of” palmerston replied “a public man is right in attacking persons but it is his attacks on classes that have given offence to powerful bodies who can make their resentment felt”109  mr gladstone’s first few weeks as leader of the house were almost a surprise “at two” he says feb 1 1867 “we went down to choose the speaker and i had to throw off in my new capacity if mistrust of self be a qualification god knows i have it” all opened excellently not only was he mild and conciliatory they found him even tiresome in his deference some onlookers still doubted everybody they said admired and respected him some loved him but there were few who understood him “so far” said a conservative observer “gladstone has led the house with great good temper prosperity and success but his rank and file and some of his colleagues seem to like him none the better on that account”110 meanwhile words of friendly encouragement came from windsor on feb 19 “the queen cannot conclude without expressing to mr gladstone her gratification at the accounts she hears from all sides of the admirable manner in which he has commenced his leadership in the house of commons”  he found the speech for a monument to lord palmerston in the abbey “a delicate and difficult duty” feb 22 “it would have worn me down beforehand had i not been able to exclude it from my thoughts till the last and then i could only feel my impotence” yet he performed the duty with grace and truth he commemorated palmerston’s share in the extension of freedom in europe and especially in italy where he said palmerston’s name might claim a place on a level with her most distinguished patriots nor had his interest ever failed in the rescue of the “unhappy african race whose history is for the most part written only in blood and tears” he applauded his genial temper his incomparable tact and ingenuity his pluck in debate his delight in a fair standup fight his inclination to avoid whatever tended to exasperate his incapacity of sustained anger     chapter x matters ecclesiastical 18641868       ὦ

of mortal men on thee i     call for treading a noiseless path in righteousness dost thou     direct all human things    i   the reader will have surmised that amidst all the press and strain in affairs of state mr gladstone’s intensity of interest in affairs of the church never for an instant slackened wide as the two spheres stood apart his temper in respect of them was much the same in church and state alike he prized institutions and the great organs of corporate life but what he thought of most and cared for and sought after most was not their mechanism though on that too he set its value but the living spirit within the institution in church and state alike he moved cautiously and tentatively in both alike he strove to unite order whether temporal order in the state or spiritual order in the church with his sovereign principle of freedom many are the difficulties in the way of applying cavour’s formula of a free church in a free state as most countries and their governors have by now found out yet to have a vivid sense of the supreme importance of the line between temporal power and spiritual is the note of a statesman fit for modern times “the whole of my public life” he wrote to the bishop of oxford in 1863 “with respect to matters ecclesiastical for the last twenty years and more has been a continuing effort though a very weak one to extricate her in some degree from entangled relations without shock or violence”  m45 the general temper of his churchmanship on its political side during these years is admirably described in a letter to his eldest son and some extracts from it furnish a key to his most characteristic frame of mind in attempting to guide the movements of his time—       to w h gladstone      april 16 1865—you appeared to speak with the supposition a     very natural one that it was matter of duty to defend all the     privileges and possessions of the church that concession would     lead to concession and that the end of the series would be its     destruction now in the first place it is sometimes necessary     in politics to make surrenders of what if not surrendered will     be wrested from us and it is very wise when a necessity of this     kind is approaching to anticipate it while it is yet a good way     off for then concession begets gratitude and often brings a     return the kind of concession which is really mischievous is     just that which is made under terror and extreme pressure and     unhappily this has been the kind of concession which for more than     two hundred years it has been the fashion of men who call and     who really think themselves “friends of the church” to make i     believe it would be a wise concession upon grounds merely     political for the church of england to have the law of church     rate abolished in all cases where it places her in fretting     conflict with the dissenting bodies i say all this however     not to form the groundwork of a conclusion but only in     illustration of a general maxim which is applicable to political     questions      but next this surely is a political question were we asked to     surrender an article of the creed in order to save the rest or to     consent to the abolition of the episcopal order these things     touch the faith of christians and the life of the church and     cannot in any measure become the subject of compromise but the     external possessions of the church were given it for the more     effectual promotion of its work and may be lessened or abandoned     with a view to the same end now we have lived into a time when     the great danger of the church is the sale of her faith for     gold in demanding the money of dissenters for the worship of     the church we practically invest them with a title to demand that     she should be adapted to their use in return and we stimulate     every kind of interference with her belief and discipline to that     end by judiciously waiving an undoubted legal claim we not only     do an act which the understood principles of modern liberty tend     to favour and almost require but we soothe ruffled minds and     tempers and what is more we strengthen the case and claim of the     church to be respected as a religious body i am convinced that     the only hope of making it possible for her to discharge her high     office as stewardess of divine truth is to deal tenderly and     gently with all the points at which her external privileges     grate upon the feelings and interests of that unhappily large     portion of the community who have almost ceased in any sense to     care for her this is a principle of broad application broader     far than the mere question of church rates it is one not     requiring precipitate or violent action or the disturbance     prematurely of anything established but it supplies a rule of the     first importance for dealing with the mixed questions of temporal     and religious interest when they arise i am very anxious to see     it quietly but firmly rooted in your mind it is connected with     the dearest interests not only of my public life but as i believe     of our religion i am in no way anxious that you should take my     opinions in politics as a model for your own your free     concurrence will be a lively pleasure to me but above all i wish     you to be free what i have now been dwelling upon is a matter     higher and deeper than the region of mere opinion it has fallen     to my lot to take a share larger than that of many around me     though in itself slight in bringing the principle i have     described into use as a ground of action i am convinced that if i     have laboured to any purpose at all it has been in great part for     this it is part of that business of reconciling the past with the     new time and order which seems to belong particularly to our     country and its rulers   he then goes on to cite as cases where something had been done towards securing the action of the church as a religious body canada where clergy and people now appointed their own bishop a recent judgment of the privy council leading to widespread emancipation of the colonial church the revival of convocation the licence to convocation to alter the thirtysixth canon the bestowal of selfgovernment on oxford “in these measures” he says “i have been permitted to take my part but had i adopted the rigid rule of others in regard to the temporal prerogatives real or supposed of the church i should at once have lost all power to promote them”  “as to disruption” he wrote in these days “that is the old cry by means of which in all times the temporal interests of the english church have been upheld in preference to the spiritual the church of england is much more likely of the two to part with her faith than with her funds it is the old question which is the greater the gold or the altar that sanctifies the gold had this question been more boldly asked and more truly answered in other times we should not have been where we now are and by continually looking to the gold and not the altar the dangers of the future will be not diminished but increased”111  m46 in 1866 mr gladstone for the first time voted for the abolition of church rates later in the session he introduced his own plan not in his capacity as minister but with the approval of the russell cabinet after this cabinet had gone out mr gladstone in 1868 introduced a bill abolishing all legal proceedings for the recovery of church rates except in cases of rates already made or where money had been borrowed on the security of the rates but it permitted voluntary assessments to be made and all agreements to make such payments on the faith of which any expense was incurred remained enforcible in the same manner as contracts of a like character mr gladstone’s bill became law in the course of the summer and a struggle that had been long and bitter ended  in another movement in the region of ecclesiastical machinery from which much was hoped though little is believed to have come mr gladstone was concerned though i do not gather from the papers that he watched it with the zealous interest of some of his friends convocation the ancient assembly or parliament of the clergy of the church of england was permitted in 1852 to resume the active functions that had been suspended since 1717 to mr gladstone some revival or institution of the corporate organisation of the church especially after the gorham judgment was ever a cherished object bishop wilberforce long one of the most intimate of his friends was chief mover in proceedings that as was hoped were to rescue the church from the anarchy in which one branch of her sons regarded her as plunged some of mr gladstone’s correspondence on the question of convocation has already been made public112 here it is enough to print a passage or two from a letter addressed by him to the bishop jan 1 1854 setting out his view of the real need of the time after a generous exaltation of the zeal and devotion of the clergy he goes on to the gains that might be expected from their effective organisation—       first as to her pastoral work her warfare against sin she would     put forth a strength not indeed equal to it but at least so much     less unequal than it now is that the good fight would everywhere     be maintained and she would not be as she now is either hated or     unknown among the myriads who form the right arm of england’s     industry and skill as to her doctrine and all that hangs upon it     such questions as might arise would be determined by the     deliberate and permanent sense of the body some unity in belief     is necessary to justify association in a christian communion will     that unity in belief be promoted or impaired by the free action of     mind within her subjected to order if her case really were so     desperate that her children had no common faith then the sooner     that imposture were detected the better but if she has then her     being provided with legitimate orderly and authentic channels     for expressing and bringing to a head as need arises the     sentiments of her people will far more clearly manifest and     while manifesting will extend deepen and consolidate that     unity it is all very well to sneer at councils but who among us     will deny that the councils which we acknowledge as lawful     representatives of the universal church were great and to all     appearance necessary providential instruments in the establishment     of the christian faith      but say some we cannot admit the laity into convocation as it     would be in derogation of the rights of the clergy or as others     say it would separate the church from the state and others more     numerous and stronger in their fear of the exclusive constitution     of the convocation resist every attempt at organising the church     and suffer and even by suffering promote the growth of all our     evils i will not touch the question of convocation except by     saying that in which i think you concur that while the present     use is unsatisfactory and even scandalous no form of church     government that does not distinctly and fully provide for the     expression of the voice of the laity either can be had or if it     could would satisfy the needs of the church of england but in my     own mind as well as in this letter i am utterly against all     premature all rapid conclusions it will be much in our day     if towards the cure of such evils when we die we can leave to     our children the precious knowledge that a beginning has been     made—a beginning not only towards enabling the bishops and clergy     to discharge their full duty but also and yet more towards     raising the real character of membership in those millions upon     millions the whole bulk of our community who now have its name     and its name alone    ii   in 1860 a volume appeared containing seven “essays and reviews” by seven different writers six of them clergymen of the church of england the topics were miscellaneous the treatment of them with one exception113 was neither learned nor weighty the tone was not absolutely uniform but it was as a whole mildly rationalistic and the negations such as they were exhibited none of the fierceness or aggression that had marked the old controversies about hampden or tract ninety or ward’s ideal a storm broke upon the seven writers that they little intended to provoke to the apparent partnership among them was severely imputed a sinister design they were styled “the septem contra christum”—six ministers of religion combining to assail the faith they outwardly professed—seven authors of an immoral rationalistic conspiracy two of them were haled into the courts one for casting doubt upon the inspiration of the bible the other for impugning the eternity of the future punishment of the wicked the queen in council upon appeal was advised to reverse a hostile judgment in the court below 1864 and lord chancellor westbury delivered the decision in a tone described in the irreverent epigram of the day as “dismissing eternal punishment with costs” this carried further or completed the principle of the gorham judgment fourteen years before and just as that memorable case determined that neither the evangelical nor the high anglican school should drive out the other so the judgment in the case of essays and reviews determined that neither should those two powerful sections drive out the new critical rationalistic liberal or latitudinarian school “it appears to me” mr gladstone wrote to the bishop of london april 26 1864 “that the spirit of this judgment has but to be consistently and cautiously followed up in order to establish as far as the court can establish it a complete indifference between the christian faith and the denial of it i do not believe it is in the power of human language to bind the understanding and conscience of man with any theological obligations which the mode of argument used and the principles assumed in the judgment would not effectually unloose” to bishop hamilton of salisbury who had taken part in one of the two cases he wrote—       feb 8 1864—this new and grave occurrence appertains to a     transition state through which the christian faith is passing the     ship is at sea far from the shore she left far from the shore she     is making for this or that deflection from her course from this     or that wind of heaven we cannot tell what it is or whether     favourable or adverse to her true work and destination unless we     know all the stages of the experience through which she has yet to     pass it seems to me that these judgments are most important in     their character as illustrations of a system or i should rather     say of the failure of a system parts of a vast scheme of forces     and events in the midst of which we stand which seem to govern     us but which are in reality governed by a hand above it may be     that this rude shock to the mere scripturism which has too much     prevailed is intended to be the instrument of restoring a greater     harmony of belief and of the agencies for maintaining belief but     be that as it may the valiant soldier who has fought manfully     should be and i hope will be of good cheer   in the same connection he wrote to sir w farquhar a friend from earliest days—       jan 31 1865—i have never been much disposed to a great     exaltation of clerical power and i agree in the necessity of     taking precautions against the establishment especially of an     insular and local though in its sphere legitimate authority of     new doctrines for that christian faith which is not for england or     france but for the world further i believe it has been a mistake     in various instances to institute the coercive proceedings which     have led to the present state of things i remember telling the     archbishop of york at penmaenmawr when he was bishop of     gloucester that it seemed to me we had lived into a time when     speaking generally penal proceedings for the maintenance of     divine truth among the clergy would have to be abandoned and     moral means alone depended on but on the other hand i feel that     the most vital lay interests are at stake in the definite teaching     and profession of the christian faith and the general tendency     and effect of the judgments has been and is likely to be hostile     to that definite teaching and unfavourable also to the moral tone     and truthfulness of men who may naturally enough be tempted to     shelter themselves under judicial glosses in opposition to the     plain meaning of words the judgments of the present tribunal     continued in a series would i fear result in the final triumph     in a sense he did not desire of mr ward’s nonnatural sense     and the real question is whether our objection to nonnatural     senses is general or is only felt when the sense favoured is the     one opposed to our own inclinations    iii   no theological book wrote mr gladstone in 1866 that has appeared since the vestiges of creation twenty years before 1844 had attracted anything like the amount of notice bestowed upon “the remarkable volume entitled ecce homo” published in 1865 it was an attempt so mr gladstone described it to bring home to the reader the impression that there is something or other called the gospel “which whatever it may be” as was said by an old pagan poet of the deity114 has formidable claims not merely on the intellectual condescension but on the loyal allegiance and humble obedience of mankind the book violently displeased both sides it used language that could not be consistently employed in treating of christianity from the orthodox point of view on the other hand it constituted “a grave offence in the eyes of those to whom the chequered but yet imposing fabric of actual christianity still casting its majestic light and shadow over the whole civilised world is a rank eyesore and an intolerable offence” between these two sets of assailants mr gladstone interposed with a friendlier and more hopeful construction115 he told those who despised the book as resting on no evidence of the foundations on which it was built and therefore as being shallow and uncritical that we have a right to weigh the nature of the message apart from the credentials of the messenger then he reassured the orthodox by the hope that “the present tendency to treat the old belief of man with a precipitate shallow and unexamining disparagement” is only a passing distemper and that to the process of its removal the author of the book would have the consolation and the praise of having furnished an earnest powerful and original contribution116 dean milman told him that he had brought to life again a book that after a sudden and brief yet brilliant existence seemed to be falling swiftly into oblivion the mask of the anonymous had much to do he thought with its popularity as had happened to the vestiges of creation undoubtedly when the mask fell off interest dropped  m47 dr pusey found the book intensely painful “i have seldom” he told mr gladstone “been able to read much at a time but shut the book for pain as i used to do with renan’s” what revolted him was not the exhibition of the human nature of the central figure but of a human nature apart from and inconsistent with its divinity the writer’s admiring or patronising tone was loathsome “what you have yourself written” pusey said “i like much but its bearings on ecce homo i can hardly divine except by way of contrast” dr newman thought that here was a case where materiam superabat opus and that mr gladstone’s observations were more valuable for their own sake than as a recommendation or defence of the book—       jan 9 1868—i hope i have followed you correctly says newman     your main proposition seems to be that whereas both jew and     gentile had his own notion of an heroic humanity and neither of     them a true notion the one being political the other even     immoral the first step necessary for bringing in the idea of an     emmanuel into the world was to form the human mould into which it     ’might drop’ and thus to supplant both the judaic and the heathen     misconception by the exhibition of the true idea next passing     from antecedent probabilities to history the order of succession     of the synoptical and the fourth gospels does in fact fulfil this     reasonable anticipation this seems to me a very great view and     i look forward eagerly to what you have still to say in     illustration of it the only objection which i see can be made to     it is that it is a clever controversial expedient after the event     for accounting for a startling fact this is an objection not     peculiar to it but to all explanations of the kind still the     question remains—whether it is a fact that the sacred writers     recognise however indirectly the wise economy which you assert     or whether it is only an hypothesis   as to the specific principles and particular opinions in mr gladstone’s criticism of what we now see to have been a not very effective or deeply influential book we may think as we will but the temper of his review the breadth of its outlook on christian thought tradition and society show no mean elements in the composition of his greatness so too does the bare fact that under the pressure of office and all the cares of a party leader in a crisis his mind should have been free and disengaged enough to turn with large and eager interest to such themes as these this was indeed the freedom of judgment with which in the most moving lines of the poem that he loved above all others virgil bidding farewell to dante makes him crowned and mitred master of himself—perch’ io te sopra te corono e mitrio117    iv   m48 other strong gusts swept the high latitudes when dr colenso bishop of natal published certain destructive criticisms upon the canonical scriptures his metropolitan at cape town pronounced sentence of deprivation colenso appealed to the queen in council and the queen in council was advised that the proceedings of the bishop of cape town were null and void for in law there was no established church in the colony nor any ecclesiastical court with lawful jurisdiction118 this triumph of heresy was a heavy blow in 1866 bishop colenso brought an action against mr gladstone and the other trustees of the colonial bishoprics fund calling upon them to set aside a sum of ten thousand pounds for the purpose of securing the income of the bishop of natal and to pay him his salary which they had withheld since his wrongful deprivation “we” said mr gladstone to miss burdett coutts “founding ourselves on the judgment say there is no see of natal in the sense of the founders of the fund and therefore of course no bishop of such a see” romilly master of the rolls gave judgment in favour of colenso these perplexities did not dismay mr gladstone “remembering what the churches in the colonies were some forty years back when i first began from my father’s having a connection with the west indies to feel an interest in them i must own that they present a cheering a remarkable indeed a wonderful spectacle” “i quite feel with you” he says to miss burdett coutts “a great uneasiness at what may follow from the exercise of judicial powers by synods merely ecclesiastical especially if small remote and unchecked by an active public opinion but in the american episcopal church it has been found practicable in a great degree to obviate any dangers from such a source” ten years after this in one of the most remarkable articles he ever wrote speaking of the protestant evangelical section of the adherents of the christian system he says that no portion of this entire group seems to be endowed with greater vigour than this in the united states and the british colonies which has grown up in new soil “and far from the possibly chilling shadow of national establishments of religion”119     chapter xi popular estimates 1868       die mitlebenden werden an vorzüglichen menschen gar leicht irre     das besondere der person stört sie das laufende bewegliche leben     verrückt ihre standpunkte und hindert das kennen und anerkennen     eines solchen mannes—goethe      the contemporaries of superior men easily go wrong about them     peculiarity discomposes them the swift current of life disturbs     their points of view and prevents them from understanding and     appreciating such men    i   it must obviously be interesting as we approach a signal crisis in his advance to know the kind of impression right or wrong made by a great man upon those who came nearest to him friends like aberdeen and graham had many years earlier foreseen the high destinies of their colleague aberdeen told bishop wilberforce in 1855 that gladstone had some great qualifications but some serious defects “the chief that when he has convinced himself perhaps by abstract reasoning of some view he thinks that every one else ought at once to see it as he does and can make no allowance for difference of opinion”120 about the same time graham said of him that he was “in the highest sense of the word liberal of the greatest power very much the first man in the house of commons detested by the aristocracy for his succession duty the most truly conservative measure passed in my recollection he must rise to the head in such a government as ours even in spite of all the hatred of him” three years later aberdeen still thought him too obstinate and if such a thing be possible too honest he does not enough think of what other men think does not enough look out of the window “whom will he lead” asked the bishop121 “oh it is impossible to say time must show and new combinations” by 1863 cardwell confidently anticipated that mr gladstone must become prime minister and bishop wilberforce finds all coming to the conclusion that he must be the next real chief122  m49 on the other side lord shaftesbury to whom things ecclesiastical were as cardinal as they were to mr gladstone ruefully reflected in 1864 that people must make ready for great and irrevocable changes palmerston was simply the peg driven through the island of delos unloose the peg and all would soon be adrift “his successor gladstone will bring with him the manchester school for colleagues and supporters a hot tractarian for chancellor and the bishop of oxford for ecclesiastical adviser he will succumb to every pressure except the pressure of a constitutional and conservative policy” “he is a dangerous man” was one of lord palmerston’s latest utterances “keep him in oxford and he is partially muzzled but send him elsewhere and he will run wild”123 “the long and short of our present position is” said shaftesbury “that the time has arrived novus sœclorum nascitur ordo for the triumph of the manchester school of which gladstone is the disciple and the organ and for the nonce they have a great advantage for though the majority of the country is against them the country has no leaders in or out of parliament whereas they are all well provided and are equally compact in purpose and action”124 somewhat earlier cool observers “out of hearing of the modulation of his voice or the torrent of his declamation” regarded him “in spite of his eloquence unsurpassed in our day perhaps in our century in spite of his abilities and experience as one most dangerous to that side to which he belongs like the elephant given by some eastern prince to the man he intends to ruin he is an inmate too costly for any party to afford to keep long”125  “one great weight that gladstone has to carry in the political race” wrote his friend frederick rogers dec 13 1868 “is a character for want of judgment and every addition to that is an impediment” and indeed it is true in politics that it often takes more time to get rid of a spurious character than to acquire the real one according to a letter from lord granville to mr gladstone feb 11 1867—       lowe described as perfectly unjust and unfounded the criticisms     which had been made of your leadership you had always been     courteous and conciliatory with the whole house and with     individual members including himself he had seen palmerston do     and say more offensive things every week than you have during the     whole session   still people went on saying that he had yet to gain the same hold over his party in parliament that he had over the party in the nation he had studied every branch of government except the house of commons he confounded the functions of leader with those of dictator he took counsel with one or two individuals instead of conferring with the party he proclaimed as edicts what he ought to have submitted as proposals he lacked “the little civilities and hypocrisies” of political society such was the common cant of the moment he had at least one friend who dealt faithfully with him—       t d acland to mr gladstone      jan 24 1868—now i am going to take a great liberty with you     i can hardly help myself i have heard a lot of grumbling lately     about you and have several times asked myself whether it would be     tanti to tease you by repeating it well what is pressed on me     is that at the present time when every one is full of anxiety as     to the future and when your warmest supporters are longing for     cohesion there is an impression that you are absorbed in     questions about homer and greek words about ecce homo that you     are not reading the newspapers or feeling the pulse of followers     one man personally complained that when you sought his opinion     you spent the whole interview in impressing your own view on him     and hardly heard anything he might have to say it is with a     painful feeling and were it not for your generous and truly     modest nature it would be with some anxiety as to how you would     take it that i consented to be the funnel of all this grumbling     as far as i can make out the feeling resolves itself into two     main points 1 whatever your own tastes may be for literature     and however strengthening and refreshing to your own mind and     heart it may be to dig into the old springs still the people     don’t understand it they consider you their own as a husband     claims a wife’s devotion and it gives a bad impression if you are     supposed to be interested except for an occasional slight     recreation about aught but the nation’s welfare at this critical     time and that it riles them to see the walls placarded with your     name and ecce homo 2 a the other point is pray forgive     me if i go too far i am simply a funnel a feeling that your     entourage is too confined and too much of secondrate men that     the strong men and the rising men are not gathered round you and     known to be so b and besides that there is so little easy     contact with the small fry as when palmerston sat in the     tearoom and men were gratified by getting private speech with     their leader but this is a small matter compared with a      mr gladstone to t d acland      hawarden jan 30 ’68—be assured i cannot feel otherwise than     grateful to you for undertaking what in the main must always be a     thankless office it is new to me to have critics such as those     whom you represent under the first head and who complain that i     do not attend to my business while the complaint is illustrated     by an instance in which professing to seek a man’s opinion i     poured forth instead the matter with which i was overflowing nor     do i well know how to deal with those who take out of my hands the     direction of my own conduct on such a question as the question     whether i ought to have undertaken a mission to sheffield to meet     roebuck on his own ground i am afraid i can offer them little     satisfaction i have been for near thirtysix years at public     business and i must myself be the judge how best to husband what     little energy of brain and time for using it may remain to me     if i am told i should go to sheffield instead of writing on ecce     homo i answer that it was my sunday’s work and change of work     is the chief refreshment to my mind it is true that literature is     very attractive and indeed seductive to me but i do not     knowingly allow it to cause neglect of public business     undoubtedly it may be said that the vacation should be given to     reading up and preparing materials for the session and of my nine     last vacations this one only has in part been given to any     literary work if i except the preparation of an address for     edinburgh in 1865 but i am sincerely though it may be     erroneously impressed with the belief that the quantity of my     public work cannot be increased without its quality being yet     further deteriorated perhaps my critics have not been troubled as     i have with this plague of quantity and are not as deeply     impressed as i am with the belief that grinding down the mental     powers by an infinity of detail is what now principally dwarfs     our public men to the immense detriment of the country this     conviction i cannot yield nor can i say more than that with     regard to the personal matters which you name i will do the best     i can but what i have always supposed and understood is that my     business in endeavouring to follow other and better men is to be     thoroughly open to all members of parliament who seek me while my     seeking them must of necessity be limited we have before us so     much business that i fear a jumble reform education and     ireland each in many branches will compete any of these alone     would be enough the last is in my mind the imperious and     overpowering subject the aspect of this letter is i think     rather combative it would have been much less so but that i trust     entirely to your indulgence   in a second letter after mentioning again some of these complaints acland says “on the other hand i know you are held by some of the best men that dear noble george grey i am thinking of to have the great quality of leadership such clear apprehension of the points in council and such faithful exactness in conveying the result agreed on truly a great power for one who has such a copia verborum with its temptations” he still insists that a leader should drop into the tearoom and have afternoon chats with his adherents and earnestly wishes him to belong to the athenæum club “a great centre of intellect and criticism” where he would be sure to meet colleagues and the principal men in the public service  m50 all this was good advice enough and most loyally intended but it was work of supererogation the house of commons like all assemblies is even less affected by immediate displays than by the standing impression of power mr gladstone might be playful courteous reserved gracious silent but the house always knew that he had a sledgehammer behind his back ready for work on every anvil in that resounding forge his sheer intellectual strength his experience and power in affairs the tremendous hold that he had now gained upon the general public out of doors made the artful genialities of the tearoom pure superfluity of the secret of the rapidity with which his star was rising and of the popular expectations thereby signified an admirable contemporary account was traced by an excellent observer126 and it would be idle to transcribe the pith of it in words other than his own—       mr gladstone’s policy is coming to be used as the concrete     expression of a whole system of thought to mean something for     itself and something widely different from either the policy     pursued by whigs or the policy attributed to lord palmerston     this is the more remarkable because mr gladstone has done less to     lay down any systematised course of action than almost any man of     his political standing has a cautiousness of speech which     frequently puzzles his audience even while they are cheering his     oratory and perceives alternatives with a clearness which often     leaves on his own advice an impression of indecision those who     are applauding the chancellor of the exchequer in season and out     of season seem however they may put their aspirations to     expect should he lead the house of commons two very important     changes they think that he will realise two longings of which     they are deeply conscious even while they express their     hopelessness of speedy realisation they believe with certain     misgivings that he can offer them a new and more satisfactory     system of foreign policy and with no misgivings that he will     break up the torpor which has fallen upon internal affairs mr     gladstone say his admirers may be too much afraid of war too     zealous for economy too certain of the status of england as a     fact altogether independent of her action but he is sure to     abandon those traditional ideas to which we have adhered so long     the notion that we are a continental people bound to maintain the     continental system interested in petty matters of boundary     concerned to dictate to germany whether she shall be united or     not to the christians of servia whether they shall rebel against     the turk or obey him to everybody whether they shall or shall not     develop themselves as they can he is sure to initiate that     temporary policy of abstention which is needed to make a breach in     the great chain of english traditions and enable the nation to     act as its interests or duties or dignity may require without     reference to the mode in which it has acted heretofore mr     gladstone for example certainly would not support the turk as if     turkish sway were a moral law would not trouble himself to     interfere with the project for cutting an eider canal would not     from very haughtiness of temperament protest in the face of europe     unless he intended his protests to be followed by some form of     action that impression may be true or it may be false but it     exists it is justified in part by mr gladstone’s recent     speeches and it indicates a very noteworthy change in the     disposition of the public mind a weariness of the line of action     called “a spirited foreign policy”  the expectation as to     internal affairs is far more definite and more strong all his     speeches point to the inauguration of a new activity in all     internal affairs to a steady determination to improve if     possible both the constitution and the condition of the millions     who have to live under it most ministers have that idea in their     heads but mr gladstone has more than the idea he has plans and     the courage to propose and maintain them he is not afraid of the     suffrage as he indicated in his celebrated speech he is not     alarmed at risking the treasury as his reductions have proved     does not hesitate to apply the full power of the state to     ameliorate social anomalies as he showed by creating state banks     state insurance offices and state annuity funds for the very     poor he of all men alive could most easily reduce our anarchical     ecclesiastical system into something like order he perhaps     alone among statesmen would have the art and the energy to try as     a deliberate plan to effect the final conciliation of     ireland127   m51 a letter from francis newman to mr gladstone is a good illustration of the almost passionate going out of men’s hearts to him in those days—       until a practical reason for addressing you arose out of  i did     not dare to intrude on you sentiments which are happily shared by     so many thousands of warm and simple hearts sentiments of warm     admiration deep sympathy fervent hope longing expectation of     lasting national blessing from your certain elevation to high     responsibility the rude monstrous shameful and shameless     attacks which you have endured do but endear you to the nation     in the moral power which you wield go on to elevate and purify     public life and we shall all bless you dear sir as a     regenerator of england keep the hearts of the people they will     never envy you and never forsake you   church afterwards the dean of st paul’s a man who united in so wonderful a degree the best gifts that come of culture sound and just sense and unstained purity of spirit said of mr gladstone at the moment of accession to power “there never was a man so genuinely admired for the qualities which deserve admiration—his earnestness his deep popular sympathies his unflinching courage and there never was a man more deeply hated both for his good points and for undeniable defects and failings but they love him much less in the house than they do out of doors a strong vein of sentiment is the spring of what is noblest about his impulses but it is a perilous quality too”128 an accomplished woman with many public interests met mr bright in scotland sometime after this “he would not hear a word said against mr gladstone he said it was just because people were not good enough themselves to understand him that he met such abuse and then he quoted the stanza in the third canto of childe harold—       “he who ascends to mountaintops shall find     the loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow     he who surpasses or subdues mankind     must look down on the hate of those below”   i asked if he did not think sometimes his temper carried mr gladstone away he said ‘think of the difference between a great cart horse and the highest bred most sensitive horse you can imagine and then under lashing of a whip think of the difference between them’ ” after a stay with mr gladstone in a country house jowett the master of balliol said of him “it is the first time that any one of such great simplicity has been in so exalted a station”129  in one of his lancashire speeches mr gladstone described in interesting language how he stood—       i have never swerved from what i conceive to be those truly     conservative objects and desires with which i entered life i am     if possible more attached to the institutions of my country than     i was when as a boy i wandered among the sandhills of seaforth     or frequented the streets of liverpool but experience has brought     with it its lessons i have learnt that there is a wisdom in a     policy of trust and folly in a policy of mistrust i have not     refused to acknowledge and accept the signs of the times i have     observed the effect that has been produced upon the country by     what is generally known as liberal legislation and if we are     told as we are now truly told that all the feelings of the     country are in the best and broadest sense conservative—that is to     say that the people value the country and the laws and     institutions of the country—honesty compels me to admit that this     happy result has been brought about by liberal legislation     therefore i may presume to say that since the year 1841 when sir     robert peel thought fit to place me in a position that brought me     into direct immediate and responsible contact with the     commercial interests of the country from that time onward i have     never swerved nor wavered but have striven to the best of my     ability to advance in the work of improving the laws and to     labour earnestly and fearlessly for the advantage of the     people130   m52 fiveandtwenty years later when his course was almost run and the achievements of the long laborious day were over he said—       i have been a learner all my life and i am a learner still but i     do wish to learn upon just principles i have some ideas that may     not be thought to furnish good materials for a liberal politician     i do not like changes for their own sake i only like a change     when it is needful to alter something bad into something good or     something which is good into something better i have a great     reverence for antiquity i rejoice in the great deeds of our     fathers in england and in scotland it may be said however that     this does not go very far towards making a man a liberal i find     however that the tories when it suits their purpose have much     less reverence for antiquity than i have they make changes with     great rapidity provided they are suitable to the promotion of     tory interests but the basis of my liberalism is this it is the     lesson which i have been learning ever since i was young i am a     lover of liberty and that liberty which i value for myself i     value for every human being in proportion to his means and     opportunities that is a basis on which i find it perfectly     practicable to work in conjunction with a dislike to unreasoned     change and a profound reverence for everything ancient provided     that reverence is deserved there are those who have been so happy     that they have been born with a creed that they can usefully     maintain to the last for my own part as i have been a learner     all my life a learner i must continue to be131     chapter xii letters 18591868       there is no saying shocks me so much as that which i hear very     often that a man does not know how to pass his time ’twould have     been but ill spoken by methusalem in the nine hundred sixtyninth     year of his life so far it is from us who have not time enough     to attain to the utmost perfection of any part of any science to     have cause to complain that we are forced to be idle for want of     work—cowley   m53 as i said in our opening pages mr gladstone’s letters are mostly concerned with points of business they were not with him a medium for conveying the slighter incidents fugitive moods fleeting thoughts of life perhaps of these fugitive moods he may have had too few to me says crassus in cicero the man hardly seems to be free who does not sometimes do nothing132 in tabletalk he could be as disengaged as marked in ease and charm as any one he was as willing as any one to accept topics as they came which is the first of all conditions for good conversation when alone in his temple of peace it was not his practice to take up his pen in the same sauntering and devious humour with him the pen was no instrument of diversion his correspondence has an object and a letter with an object is not of a piece with the effusions of madame de sévigné cowper scott fitzgerald and other men and women whose letters of genial satire and casual play and hints of depth below the surface people will read as long as they read anything we have to remember a very intelligible fact mentioned by him to lord brougham who had asked him to undertake some public address april 25 1860—       you have given me credit for your own activity and power of work     an estimate far beyond the truth i am one of those who work very     hard while they are at it and are then left in much exhaustion i     have been for four months overdone and though my general health     thank god is good yet my brain warns me so distinctly that it     must not be too much pressed as to leave me in prudence no course     to take except that which i have reluctantly indicated   we might be tempted to call good letterwriting one of “the little handicraft of an idle man” but then two of the most perfect masters of the art were cicero and voltaire two of the most occupied personages that ever lived of course sentences emerge in mr gladstone’s letters that are the fruits of his experience well worthy of a note as when he says to dr pusey “i doubt from your letter whether you are aware of the virulence and intensity with which the poison of suspicion acts in public life all that you say in your letter of yesterday i can readily believe but i assure you it does not alter in the slightest degree the grounds on which my last letter was written”  he thanks bulwer lytton for a volume of his republished poems but chides him for not indicating dates—       this i grant is not always easy for a conscientious man for     example when he has almost rewritten but i need not remind you     how much the public if i may judge from one of its number would     desire it when it can be done for in the case of those whom it     has learned to honour and admire there is a biography of the mind     that is thus signified and that is matter of deep interest   on external incidents he never fails in a graceful apt or feeling word when the author of the christian year dies 1866 he says “mr liddon sent me very early information of mr keble’s death the church of england has lost in him a poet a scholar a philosopher and a saint i must add that he always appeared to me since i had the honour and pleasure of knowing him a person of most liberal mind i hope early steps will be taken to do honour to his pure and noble memory”  to the widow of a valued official in his financial department he writes in commemorative sentences that testify to his warm appreciation of zeal in public duty—       the civil service of the crown has beyond all question lost in mr     arbuthnot one of the highest ornaments it ever possessed his     devotion to his duties his identification at every point of his     own feelings with the public interests will i trust not die     with him but will stimulate others and especially the inheritors     of his name to follow his bright example nor is it with a     thought of anything but thankfulness on his account that i     contemplate the close of his labours but it will be long indeed     before we cease to miss his great experience his varied powers     his indefatigable energy and that highminded loyal tone which he     carried into all the parts of business   in another letter by the way he says 1866 “i am far from thinking very highly of our rank as a nation of administrators but perhaps if we could be judged by the post office alone we might claim the very first place in this respect” in time even this ’most wonderful establishment’ was to give him trouble enough  m54 among the letters in which mr gladstone exhibits the easier and less strenuous side and that have the indefinable attraction of intimacy pleasantness and the light hand are those written in the ten years between 1858 and 1868 to the duchess of sutherland she was the close and lifelong friend of the queen she is said the queen to stockmar “so anxious to do good so liberalminded so superior to prejudice and so eager to learn and to improve herself and others”133 the centre of a brilliant and powerful social circle she was an ardent sympathiser with italy with poland with the abolitionists and the north and with humane causes at home she was accomplished a lover of books meritorious in aim though too often slight in work—in short with emotions and sentiments sometimes a little in advance of definite ideas yet a high representative of the virtue purity simplicity and sympathetic spirit of the tennysonian epoch tennyson himself was one of her idols and mr gladstone was another bishop wilberforce too was often of the company and the duke of argyll who had married a daughter of the house her admiration for gladstone says the son of the duchess “was boundless and the last years of her life were certainly made happier by this friendship his visits to her were always an intense pleasure and even when suffering too much to receive others she would always make an effort to appear sufficiently well to receive him i find in a letter from her written to me in 1863 after meeting mr gladstone when on a visit to her sister lady taunton at quantock in somersetshire the following ‘the gladstones were there he was quite delightful pouring out such floods of agreeable knowledge all day long and singing admirably in the evening nobody makes me feel more the happiness of knowledge and the wish for it one must not forget that he has the happiness of the peace which passeth all understanding’ ”134 the gladstones were constant visitors at the duchess’s various princely homes—stafford house in the green park trentham cliveden and chiswick on the thames dunrobin on the dornoch firth  a little sheaf of pieces from mr gladstone’s letters to her may serve to show him as he was in the midst of his labours in the palmerston government—how little his native kindliness of heart and power of sympathy had been chilled or parched either by hard and ceaseless toil or by the trying atmosphere of public strife       1859      aug 30—i am much concerned to lose at the last moment the     pleasure of coming to see you at trentham—but my wife who was not     quite well when i came away but hoped a day’s rest would make her     so writes through agnes to say she hopes i shall get back today     the gratification promised me must therefore i fear stand over     i will write from hawarden and i now send this by a messenger     lest as you might be sure i should not fail through carelessness     you should think anything very bad had happened among other     things i wanted help from you through speech about tennyson i     find maud takes a good deal of trouble to understand and is     hardly worth understanding it has many peculiar beauties but     against them one sets the strange and nearly frantic passages     about war which one can hardly tell whether he means to be taken     for sense or ravings frank doyle who is essentially a poet     though an unwrought one declares guinevere the finest poem of     modern times      1860      hawarden oct 3—we are exceedingly happy at penmaenmawr     between italy health hill and sea all taken together i do not     know if you are acquainted with the welsh coast and interior but     i am sure you would think it well worth knowing both for the     solitary grandeur of the snowdon group and for the widely     diffused and almost endless beauty of detail it is a kind of     landscape jewellery      the herberts send us an excellent account of lord aberdeen i have     a very interesting letter from lacaita fresh from panizzi who     again was fresh from italy and sanguine about the emperor but     what a calamity for a man to think or find himself forced to be     double faced even when he is not double minded and this is the     best supposition but warsaw is surely the point at which for the     present we must look with suspicion and aversion today’s papers     give good hope that garibaldi has been misrepresented and does not     mean to play into mazzini’s hands      thanks for your condolences about the times i have had it both     ways though more perhaps of the one than the other some of the     penny press which has now acquired an enormous expansion go     great lengths in my favour and i read some eulogies quite as wide     of fact as the interpretations      oct 19—i think mr or sir something burke how ungrateful     has been so kind as to discover the honours of my mother’s descent     in some book that he has published on royal descents but the     truth is that time plays strange tricks backwards as well as     forwards and it seems hardly fair to pick the results the     arithmetic of those questions is very curious at the distance of     a moderate number of centuries everybody has some hundred thousand     ancestors subject however to deduction      nov 1— there is one proposition which the experience of     life burns into my soul it is this that man should beware of     letting his religion spoil his morality in a thousand ways some     great some small but all subtle we are daily tempted to that     great sin to speak of such a thing seems dishonouring to god but     it is not religion as it comes from him it is religion with the     strange and evil mixtures which it gathers from abiding in us     this frightful evil seems to rage in the roman church more than     anywhere else probably from its highly wrought political spirit     the virtues and the vices of a close organisation being much     associated with one another that same influence which keeps the     mother from her child teaches montalembert to glorify the     corruption cruelty and baseness which in the government of the     papal states put the gospel itself to shame      1861      11 carlton h terrace march 5—i dare scarcely reply to your     letter for although the scene at trentham the death of the duke     of sutherland is much upon my mind it is amidst this crowd and     pressure of business an image reflected in ruffled waters while     it is also eminently one that ought to be kept true a sacred     sorrow seems to be profaned by bringing it within the touch of     worldly cares still i am able i hope not unnaturally to speak     of the pleasure which your letter has given me for i could not     wish it other than it is      i am not one of those who think that after a stroke like this it     is our duty to try and make it seem less than it is it is great     for all for you it is immense for there has now been first     loosened and then removed the central stay of such a continuation     of domestic love as i should not greatly exaggerate in calling     without rival or example and if its stay centred in him so did     its fire in you i only wish and heartily pray that your sorrow     may be a tender and gentle one even as it is great and strong i     call it great and strong more than sharp for then only the     fierceness of death is felt when it leaves painful and rankling     thoughts of the departed or when it breaks the kindly process of     nature and reverses the order in which she would have us quit the     place of our pilgrimage by ravishing away those whose life is but     just opened or is yet unfulfilled but you are now yearning over a     death which has come softly to your door and gone softly from it     a death in ripeness of years ripeness of love and honour and     peace ripeness above all in character a part of your letter     brings to my mind a letter of st bernard on the death of his     brother remember he was a monk and so what a brother might be to     him which when i read it years ago seemed to me the most touching     and beautiful expression of a natural grief that i had ever     known—i will try to find it and if i find it answers my     recollection you shall hear of it again135 i always think     thomas à kempis a golden book for all times but most for times     like these for though it does not treat professedly of sorrow it     is such a wonderful exhibition of the man of sorrows      1862      april 4—i am grateful to you and to your thoughts for the     quality they so eminently possess the latins have a word for it     but we have none and i can only render it by a rude conversion     into “sequacious” or thoughts given to following      my labours of yesterday budget speech had no title to so kind a     reception as they actually met with quiet my office in these     times cannot be but this year it promises me the boon of     comparative peace at least in the outer sphere the world     believes that this is what i cannot endure i shall be glad of an     opportunity of putting its opinion to the test      all words from you about the queen are full of weight and value     even when they are not so decidedly words of consolation in her     i am even glad to hear of the little bit of symbolism that     principle like others has its place and its applications i     believe are right when they flow from and conform to what is     within i cannot but hope she will have much refreshment in     scotland such contact with nature’s own very undisguised and     noble self in such forms of mountain wood breeze and water     these are continual preachers and so mild that they can bring no     weariness they come straight from their maker’s hand and how     faithfully they speak of him in their strength their majesty and     their calm      as for myself i am a discharged vessel today a load of figures     has a suffocating effect upon the brain until they are well     drilled and have taken their places then they are as digestible     as other food of that region still it is better when they are     off and it is always a step towards liberty      i must at some time try to explain a little more my reference to     thomas à kempis i have given that book to men of uncultivated     minds who were also presbyterians but all relish it i do not     believe it is possible for any one to read that book earnestly     from its beginning and think of popish or nonpopish or of     anything but the man whom it presents and brings to us      may 8—unfortunately i can give you no light on the question of     time i a bear chained to a stake cannot tell when the principal     run will be made at me and as i can only scratch once i must wait     if possible till then the only person who could give you des     renseignements suffisants is disraeli tennyson’s note is     charming i return it and with it a touching note from princess     alice which reached me this evening pray let me have it again      1863      jan 23—i am so sorry to be unable to come to you owing to an     engagement tonight at the admiralty i am ashamed of being     utterly destitute of news—full of figures and all manner of     dulnesses i went however to the drury lane pantomime last     night and laughed beyond measure also enjoyed looking from a     third row unseen myself at your brother and the blantyre party      bowden park chippenham feb 7—i feel as if your generous and     overflowing sympathies made it truly unkind to draw you further     into the sorrows of this darkened house my brother john closed     his long and arduous battle in peace this morning at six o’clock     and if the knowledge that he had the love of all who knew him     together with the assurance that he is at rest in god could     satisfy the heart we ought not to murmur but the visitation is     no common one eight children seven of them daughters of whom     only one is married and most are young with one little boy of     seven lost their mother last february and now see their father     taken he dies on his marriage day we are to bury him on the     first anniversary of his wife’s death altogether it is piteous     beyond belief it was affectionate anxiety in her illness that     undermined his health it was reluctance to make his children     uneasy that made him suffer in silence and travel to bath for     advice and an operation when he should have been in his bed in     this double sense he has offered up his life the grief is very     sharp and as yet i am hardly reconciled to it but enough and     too much only i must answer your question he was the brother     next above me we were not brothers only but very intimate friends     until we married and since then we have only been separated in     the relative sense in which our marriages and my public life in     particular implied he was a man of high spirit and uncommon     goodness and for him i have not a thought that is not perfect     confidence and peace      march 1—even you could not i am persuaded do otherwise than     think me rather a savage on wednesday evening for the opinion i     gave about helping a bazaar for the sisters of charity of the     roman community at some place in england let me say what i meant     by it and what i did not mean i did not mean to act as one under     the influence of violent antiroman feeling i rejoice to think in     community of faith among bodies externally separated so far as it     extends and it extends very far most of all with ancient     churches of the greatest extent and the firmest organisation but     the proselytising agency of the roman church in this country i     take to be one of the worst of the religious influences of the     age i do not mean as to its motives for these i do not presume     to touch nor feel in any way called upon to question but i speak     of its effects and they are most deplorable the social misery     that has been caused not for truth but for loss of truth is     grievous enough but it is not all for to those who are called     converts and to those who have made them we owe a very large     proportion of the mischiefs and scandals within our own communion     that have destroyed the faith of many and that are i fear     undermining the very principle of faith in thousands and tens of     thousands who as yet suspect neither the process nor the cause     with this pernicious agency i for my own part wish to have nothing     whatever to do although i am one who thinks lightly in     comparison with most men of the absolute differences in our     belief from the formal documents of the church of rome and who     wish for that church on her own ground as for our own all     health that she can desire all reformation that can be good for     her the object however of what i have said is not to make an     argument but only to show that if i spoke strongly i was not     also speaking lightly on such a subject      april 20—i am afraid i shall not see you before wednesday—when     you are to do us so great a kindness—but i must write a line to     tell you how exceedingly delighted we both are with all we have     seen at windsor the charm of the princess so visible at a     distance increases with the increase of nearness the queen’s     tone is delightful all seems good delighted and happy in the     family as regards the queen’s physical strength it must be     satisfactory what is more fatiguing than interviews last night     however i saw her at halfpast seven after a long course of them     during the day she was quite fresh      may 10—i can answer you with a very good conscience the affair     of friday night his speech on italy was on my part entirely     drawn forth by the speech of disraeli and the wish of lord     palmerston it is d’s practice in contravention of the usage of     the house which allows the minister to wind up to lie by until     lord palmerston has spoken and then fire in upon him so on this     occasion i was a willing instrument but my wife who was within     ten minutes’ drive knew nothing      we dined at marlborough house last night the charm certainly does     not wear off with renewed opportunity clarendon who saw her for     the first time fully felt it do you know i believe they are     actually disposed to dine with us some day do you think you can     then be tempted we asked the bishop of brechin to meet you on     thursday another bishop has volunteered the bishop of montreal     who is just going off to america you will not be frightened both     are rather notable men the other guests engaged are cobden     thackeray and mr evarts the new us coadjutor to adams      july 10—i knew too well the meaning of your nonappearance and     because i knew it was sorry for your indisposition as well as for     your absence we had the de greys granville sir c eastlake     fechter136 and others with the comte de paris who is as simple     as ever but greatly developed and come on he talked much of     america i hope we may come tomorrow not later than by the 55     train to which i feel a kind of grateful attachment for the     advantage and pleasure it has so often procured me we are glad to     have a hope of you next week all our people are charmed with mr     fechter—yours affectionately      july 29—i am greatly concerned to hear of your suffering you     are not easily arrested in your movements and i fear the time has     been sharp but while above all i trust you will not stir without     free and full permission i do not abandon the hope of seeing you      i have been seeing lady theresa lewis it was heartrending     woe such as makes one ashamed of having so little to offer she     dwells much upon employing herself i greatly mistrust     compulsion in the management of children and under the     circumstances you describe i should lean as you do  many     thanks for the carnations you sent by my wife they still live and     breathe perfume you spoke of our difference about slavery i     hope it is not very wide i stop short of war as a means of     correction i have not heard you say that you do otherwise      11 carlton house terrace no date—i am glad my wife saw you     yesterday for i hope a little that she may have been bold enough     to lecture you about not taking enough care of yourself if this     sounds rather intrusive pray put it down to my intense confidence     in her as a doctor she has a kind of divining power springing     partly from a habitual gift and partly from experience and she     hardly ever goes wrong she is not easy about your going to vichy     alone the house of commons rude and unmannerly in its     arrangements at all times is singularly so in its last kicks and     plunges towards the death of the session but after tomorrow we     are free and i look forward to seeing you on wednesday according     to the hope you give soon after this reaches you i hope to be     at hawarden on wednesday i am to have luncheon at argyll lodge to     meet tennyson since i gave him my translation of the first book     of the iliad i have often remembered those words of kingsley’s     to his friend mr—— “my dear friend your verses are not good but     bad” the duc d’aumale breakfasted with us on thursday and i had     some conversation about america he is i think pleased with the     good opinions which the young princes have won so largely and     seems to have come very reluctantly to the conclusion that the war     is hopeless our children are gone and the vacant footfall echoes     on the stair my wife is waiting here only to see lady herbert      hawarden aug 21—we have had dr stanley here with his sister     he was charming she only stayed a moment he gave a good account     of the queen they go to italy for september and october when any     one goes there i always feel a mental process of accompanying     them we have got mr woolner here too he took it into his head     to wish to make a bust of me and my wife accepted his offer at     least by her authority caused me to accept it he has worked very     quickly and i think with much success but he bestows immense     labour before closing he is a poet too it seems and generally a     very good companion my journey to balmoral will not be for     some five weeks i am dreadfully indolent as to any exertion     beyond reading but i look forward to it with interest indeed     your scruples about writing were misplaced there is no holiday of     mine to leave unbroken so far as post is concerned and well would     it be with me even in the time of an exhaustion which requires to     be felt before it can pass away if the words of my other letters     were i will not say like but more like yours however the     murmur which i thus let escape me is ungrateful i ought to be     thankful for the remission that i get but treasury business is     the most odious that i know and hence it is that one wishes that     the wheel would for a little time cease its drive altogether     instead of merely lowering it      penmaenmawr sept 20—it was so kind of you to see our little     fellows on their way through town i hope they were not     troublesome harry is rather oppressed i think with the     responsibilities of his captainship—he is the head of seven boys      we went yesterday to visit the stanleys and saw the south stack     lighthouse with its grand and savage rocks they are very     remarkable one part for masses of sheer precipices descending in     columns to the sea the other for the extraordinary contortions     which the rocks have undergone from igneous action and huge     compressing forces our weather has been and continues cold for     the season which draws onwards however and the gliding days     recall to mind the busy outer world from which we are so well     defended      1864      jan 4—often as i have been struck by the queen’s extraordinary     integrity of mind—i know of no better expression—i never felt it     more than on hearing and reading a letter of hers on saturday at     the cabinet about the danish question her determination in this     case as in others not inwardly to “sell the truth” this is     robert pollok overbears all prepossessions and longings strong     as they are on the german side and enables her spontaneously to     hold the balance it seems to me tolerably even      jan 14—i am glad you were not scandalised about my laxity as     to the “public house” but i expected from you this liberality i     really had no choice how can i who drink good wine and bitter     beer every day of my life in a comfortable room and among     friends coolly stand up and advise hardworking fellowcreatures     to take “the pledge” however i have been reading maguire’s life     of father matthew with a most glowing admiration for the father     every one knew him to be good but i had no idea of the extent and     height of his goodness and his boundless power and thirst not for     giving only but for loving      june 27—just at this time when the press and mass of ordinary     business ought to be lessening the foreign crisis you see comes     upon us and drowns us deeper than ever i fully believe that     england will not go to war and i am sure she ought not are     you not a little alarmed at argyll on this matter of the fate of     the government i cannot speak with much confidence or with much     anxious desire but on the whole i rather think and rather     hope we shall come through      three marriages almost in as many weeks among your own immediate     kin i look for a dinner at woolner’s with tennyson today a sei     occhi last night manning spent three hours with me the     conversation must wait he is sorely antigaribaldian how     beautiful is the ending of newman’s apologia part vii      oct 23—singularly happy in my old and early political     friendships i am now stripped of every one of them it has indeed     been my good lot to acquire friendships in later life which i     could not have hoped for but at this moment i seem to see the     spirits of the dead gathered thick around me “all along the     narrow valley” the valley of life over and into which the sun of     a better of a yet better life shines narrowly i do not think     our political annals record such a removal of a generation of     statesmen before its time as we have witnessed in the last four     years i could say a great deal about newcastle he was a high and     strong character very true very noble and i think     intelligible which as you know i think rare in politicians my     relations with him will be kept up in one sense by having to act     and i fear act much as his executor and trustee with de tabley     an excellent colleague who discharged the same duty for the duke     of hamilton and for canning      dec 28—i cannot give you a full account of lord derby’s     translation of the iliad but there is no doubt in my mind     that it is a very notable production he always had in a high     degree the inborn faculty of a scholar with this he has an     enviable power of expression and an immense command of the     english tongue add the quality of dash which appears in his     version quite as much as in his speeches undoubtedly if he     wrought his execution as tennyson does results might have been     attained beyond the actual ones but while i will not venture to     speak of the precision of the version various passages in the     parts i have read are of very high excellence try to find out     what tennyson thinks of it      1865      aug 8—my reading has been little but even without your     question i was going to mention that i had caught at the name of     “l’ami fritz” seeing it was by the author of the conscrit     and had read it i can recommend it too though the subject does     not at first sight look ravishing it tells how a middleaged     middleclass german bachelor comes to marry the daughter of his     own farm bailiff some parts are full of grace there is a     taxgatherer’s speech on the duty of paying taxes which came home     to my heart though it a little reminds me of a sermon which i     heard preached in an aisle of the duomo of milan to the boys of a     sunday school said to have been founded by st charles borromeo     on the absolute necessity of paying tithes the golden breadths of     harvest are now a most lively joy to me but we have had great     official troubles in the death of mr arbuthnot a pillar of the     treasury and a really notable man      sept 12—i am working off my post as well as i can with the     bands playing and flags fluttering outside by and by i am going     to carve rounds of beef for some part of four hundred diners the     ladies are only allowed tea our weather anxieties are great     but all is going well the new telegram and announcement that you     will come on friday is very welcome indeed i did not say     anything about the marriage because without knowing more i did     not know what to say except that i most sincerely wish them all     good and all happiness the rest must keep till friday the     characters you describe are quite i think on the right ground     it was the great glory of the greeks that they had those full and     large views of man’s nature not the narrow and pinched ones which     are sometimes found even among christians lord palmerston’s     abandoning his trip to bristol is rather a serious affair there     is more in it i fear than gout      oct 24—if you were well enough and i had wings there is     nothing i should more covet at this moment than to appear at     inveraray and compare and correct my impressions of lord     palmerston’s character by yours death of itself produces a     certain tendency to view more warmly what was before admired and     more slightly anything that was not and by stirring the thought     of the nation through the press it commonly throws lights upon the     subject either new in themselves or new in their combination     twelve cabinet ministers i have already reckoned in my mind all     carried off by the rude hand of death in the last five years     during which three only have been made they are lord dalhousie     lord aberdeen lord herbert sir j graham lord canning lord     elgin sir g lewis lord campbell lord macaulay mr ellice     lord lyndhurst lord palmerston this in the political world and     to me especially is an extraordinary desolation      i hope you are at least creeping on it was so kind of you to     think about my little neuralgic affairs thank god i have had no     more      1866      hawarden jan 4—we have been pleased with some partial     accounts of improvement and i can the better speak my wish to you     for a happy new year next wednesday i hope to inquire for myself     i have been much laden and a good deal disturbed we have the     cattle plague in full force here and it has even touched my small     group of tenants to some of them it is a question of life and     death and my brotherinlaw who is by nature one of the most     munificent persons i ever knew is sorely straitened in mind at     not being able to do all he would like for his people but do not     let this sound like complaint from me few have such cause for     ceaseless and unbounded thankfulness      if you come across armstrong’s poems137 pray look at them an     irish youth cut off at twentyfour by the by wortley’s children     have admirable acting powers which they showed in charades very     cleverly got up by his wife as stage manager grosvenor seconds     the speech and f cavendish moves the address we have had divers     thrushes singing

great gain disraeli     and i were affectionate at the mansion house last night poor     fellow he has been much tried about his wife’s health the king     of the belgians pleases me and strikes me more as to his personal     qualities on each successive visit god bless you my dear duchess     and precious friend affectionately yours      1867      hawarden april 29—we both hope to have the pleasure of dining     at chiswick on wednesday we assume that the hour will be 730 as     usual i shall be so glad to see argyll and to tell him the     little i can about the literary department of the guardian i     write from the “temple of peace” it is a sore wrench to go away     but i am thankful to have had such a quiet easter the false     rumour about paris has had a most beneficial effect and has     spared me a multitude of demands the birds are delightful here     what must they be at cliveden—ever affectionately yours      holker hall sept 22—we find this place very charming it     explains at once the secret of the great affection they all have     for it it has a singular combination of advantages—sea hill     home ground and views access and the house such an excellent     living house all the parts too in such good keeping and     proportion we much admire your steps the inhabitants would be     quite enough to make any place pleasant we have just been at that     noble old church of cartmel these churches are really the best     champions of the men who built them      nov 23—i cannot let the moment pass at which i would have been     enjoying a visit to you after your severe illness without one word     of sympathy our prospects are uncertain but i cling to the     hope of escaping to the country at the end of next week unless     the proposals of the government as to the mode of providing for     the expense of this unhappy war should prove to be very     exceptionable which at present i do not expect i saw lord     russell last night he seemed very well but more deaf lady     russell has had some partial failure of eyesight lord r is     determined on an educational debate and has given notice of     resolutions all his friends i think are disposed to regret it     i am told the exchequer is deplorably poor poor disraeli has been     sorely cut up and it has not yet appeared that mrs disraeli is     out of danger though she is better her age seems to be at the     least seventysix i have been to see my china exhibited in its     new home at liverpool where it seemed pretty comfortable      1868      31 bloomsbury square jan 3—i promised to write to you in case     i found matters either bad or good i lament to say they are bad     he panizzi is weaker more feverish pulse today at 122 about     noon and very restless the best will be a severe struggle and     the issue is likely to be unfavourable at the same time he is     not given over i said i shall come tomorrow he said you will     not find me alive i replied that was wrong i believe there is no     danger tomorrow but what next week may do is another matter he     is warm and affectionate as ever and very tender he is firm and     resigned not stoically but with trust in god i am very sad at     the thought of losing this very true trusty hearty friend i     must go tomorrow though of course i should stay if i could be of     any use138   this year the end came and a few lines from his diary show the loss it was to mr gladstone—       oct 28—the post brought a blackbordered letter which     announced the death of the dowager duchess of sutherland i have     lost in her from view the warmest and dearest friend surely that     ever man had why this noble and tender spirit should have had     such bounty for me and should have so freshened my advancing     years my absorbed and divided mind i cannot tell but i feel     strange as it might sound ten years the older for her death may     the rest and light and peace of god be with her ever more until     that day none will fill her place for me nor for many worthier     than i     chapter xiii reform 1866       l’aristocratie la démocratie ne sont pas de vaines doctrines     livrées a

been in scotland and found no strong feeling for reform or any other extensive change while there was a general decline of interest in the ballot—       gladstone said “certainly as far as my constituents go there is     no strong feeling for reform among them and as to the ballot i     think it is declining in favour” he spoke of the difficulties     before us of the embarrassment of the reform question “with a     majority of 80 on the liberal side they will expect some action”     i answered “no doubt a majority of 80 agreed on any point would     expect action at the time of the first reform bill when the     whole party was for the bill the course was clear but is the     party agreed now the point it was agreed upon was to support lord     palmerston’s government but was that in order to pass a strong     measure of reform suppose that the country is satisfied with the     foreign policy and the home policy and the financial policy and     wants to maintain these and their authors and does not want great     changes of any kind” i was on the whole pleased with the tone     of gladstone’s conversation it was calm and for soothing     difficulties not for making them i should add that gladstone     spoke with great kindness about yourself and about your     management of the house of commons and said that it would be his     wish that you should lead it139   m55 the antecedents of the memorable crisis of 18667 were curious reform bills had been considered by five governments since 1849 and mentioned in six speeches from the throne each political party had brought a plan forward and lord john russell had brought forward three mr bright also reduced his policy to the clauses of a bill in 1858 in 1859 lord derby’s government had introduced a measure which old whigs and new radicals uniting their forces had successfully resisted this move mr gladstone—who as the reader will recollect had on that occasion voted with the tories140—always took to impose a decisive obligation on all who withstood the tory attempt at a settlement to come forward with proposals of their own on the other hand in the new parliament the tory party was known to be utterly opposed to an extension of the franchise and a considerable fringe of professing liberals also existed who were quite as hostile though not quite as willing to avow hostility before their constituents all the leaders were committed and yet of their adherents the majority was dubious or adverse the necessity of passing a reform bill through an antireform parliament thus produced a situation of unsurpassed perplexity some thought that formidable susceptibilities would be soothed if the government were reconstructed and places found for new men others declared that the right course would be first to weld the party together by bills on which everybody was agreed to read a good reform bill a first time then in the recess the country would let ministers see where they were and the next session would find them on firm ground but lord russell knew that he had little time to spare—he was now close upon seventyfour—and mr gladstone was the last man to try to hold him back  the proceedings of the new government began with a familiar demonstration of the miserable failure of english statesmen to govern ireland in the shape of the twentieth coercion bill since the union this need not detain us nor need the budget the eighth of the series that made this administration so memorable in the history of national finance it was naturally quite enough for parliament that the accounts showed a surplus of £1350000 that the last tax on raw material vanished with the repeal of the duty on timber that a series of commercial treaties had been successfully negotiated and that homage should be paid to virtue by the nibbling of a mouse at the mountain of the national debt the debt was eight hundred millions and it was now proposed to apply halfamillion a year towards its annihilation reform however was the fighting question and fighting questions absorb a legislature  m56 the chancellor of the exchequer introduced the reform bill march 12 in a speech that though striking enough was less impassioned than some of his later performances in the course of this famous contest he did not forget that “the limbo of abortive creations was peopled with the skeletons of reform bills” and it was his cue in a house so constituted as the one before him to use the language and arguments of moderation and safety franchise was the real question at stake and to that branch of reform the bill was limited the other question of redistributing seats he likened to fighting in a wood where there may be any number of partial encounters but hardly a great and deciding issue the only point on which there was a vital difference was the figure of the borough franchise in 1859 mr disraeli invented a quackish phrase about lateral extension and vertical extension and offered votes to various classes who mainly had them already without extending downwards but whatever else his plan might do it opened no door for the workmen in 1860 the palmerston government proposed a six pound occupation franchise for boroughs and ten pounds for counties the proposal of 1866 was seven pounds for boroughs and fourteen for counties we may smile at the thought that some of the most brilliant debates ever heard in the house of commons now turned upon the mighty puzzle whether the qualification for a borough voter should be occupancy of a ten a seven or a six pound house—nay whether the ruin or salvation of the state might not lie on the razoredge of distinction between rating and rental ministers were taunted with having brought in mr bright’s bill mr bright replied that he could not find in it a single point that he had recommended he was never in favour of a six pound franchise he believed in a household franchise but if a seven pound franchise was offered beggars could not be choosers and seven pounds he would take in a fragmentary note of later years mr gladstone among other things describes one glittering protagonist of the hour—       lord russell adhered with great tenacity to his ideas in which he     was strongly supported by me as his leader in the commons and by     granville and others of the cabinet bright the representative     man of popular ideas behaved with an admirable combination of     discretion and loyalty lowe was an outspoken opponent so     superstitiously enamoured of the ten pound franchise as to be     thrown into a temper of general hostility to a government which     did not recognise its finality and sanctity he pursued our modest     reform bill of 1866 with an implacable hostility and really     supplied the whole brains of the opposition so effective were his     speeches that during this year and this year only he had such a     command of the house as had never in my recollection been     surpassed nor was there any warrant for imputing to him     dishonesty of purpose or arrièrepensée but his position was     one for the moment of personal supremacy and this to such an     extent that when all had been reconciled and the time for his     peerage came i pressed his viscountcy on the sovereign as a     tribute to his former elevation which though shortlived was     due to genuine power of mind as it seemed to me that a man who     had once soared to those heights trodden by so few ought not to     be lost in the common ruck of official barons   the first trial of strength arose upon a device of one of the greatest of the territorial whigs seconded by a much more eminent man in the ranks of territorial tories lord grosvenor announced a motion that they would not proceed with the franchise until they were in possession of the ministerial intentions upon seats lord stanley the son of the tory leader seconded the motion any other form would have served equally well as a test of conflicting forces the outlook was clouded mr brand the skilful whip informed the cabinet that there were three classes of disaffected liberals who might possibly be kept in order first those who although opposed to reform were averse to a change of government next those who doubted whether ministers really intended to deal with the seats at all and finally those who felt sure that when they came to deal with seats they would be under the baleful influence of bright the first of the three sections could best be kept right by means of a stiff line against grosvenor and stanley and the other two sections by the simple production of the seats bill before taking the committee on franchise the expert’s counsels were followed mr gladstone told the house that lord grosvenor’s motion would be treated as a vote of want of confidence but that he would disclose the whole plan as soon as the franchise bill had passed its second reading the mutterings only grew louder at a great meeting in liverpool april 6 accompanied by some of his colleagues mr gladstone roused the enthusiasm of his audience to the utmost pitch by declaring that the government would not flinch that they had passed the rubicon broken the bridges burned their boats still the malcontents were not cowed  m57 the leader himself rose in warmth of advocacy as the struggle went on the advocates of privilege used language about the workers that in his generous and sympathetic mind fanned the spark into a flame lowe asked an unhappy question that long stood out as a beacon mark in the controversy—whether “if you wanted venality ignorance drunkenness—if you wanted impulsive unreflecting violent people—where do you look for them do you go to the top or to the bottom” harsh judgments like this of the conditions of life and feeling in the mass of the nation—though lowe was personally one of the kindest of men—made mr gladstone stand all the more ardently by the objects of such sweeping reproach in a discussion upon electoral statistics he let fall a phrase that reverberated through the discussion inside parliament and out some gentlemen he said deal with these statistics as if they were ascertaining the numbers of an invading army “but the persons to whom their remarks apply are our fellowsubjects our fellowchristians our own flesh and blood who have been lauded to the skies for their good conduct”141 this was instantly denounced by lord cranborne142 as sentimental rant and inquiries soon followed why kinship in flesh and blood should be strictly limited by a seven pound rental speedily mr gladstone passed from steady practical argument in the ministerial key to all the topics of popular enthusiasm and parliamentary invective his impulsiveness said critical observers “betrays him at times into exaggeration or incaution but there is a generous quality in it” mr bright once talked of his own agitation for reform as no better than flogging a dead horse the parliamentary struggle led by mr gladstone brought the dead horse to life stirred the combative instincts and roused all the forces of reform lowe was glittering energetic direct and swift mr disraeli contented to watch his adversaries draw their swords on one another did not put forth all his power in a moment of unwisdom he taunted mr gladstone with his stripling’s speech at the oxford union fiveandthirty years before as aberdeen once said “gladstone is terrible on the rebound”143 and anybody less imperturbable than disraeli would have found his retort terrible here his speech on the second reading april 27 as a whole ranks among the greatest of his performances “spoke” he says “from one to past three following disraeli it was a toil much beyond my strength but i seemed to be sustained and borne onwards i knew not how” the party danger the political theme the new responsibility of command the joy of battle all seemed to transfigure the orator before the vision of the house as if he were the greek hero sent forth to combat by pallas athene with flame streaming from head and shoulders from helmet and shield like the star of summer rising effulgent from the sea one personal passage deserves a biographic place—       my position sir in regard to the liberal party is in all points     the opposite of earl russell’s i have none of the claims he     possesses i came among you an outcast from those with whom i     associated driven from them i admit by no arbitrary act but by     the slow and resistless forces of conviction i came among you to     make use of the legal phraseology in formâ pauperis i had     nothing to offer you but faithful and honourable service you     received me as dido received the shipwrecked Æneas—      “ ejectum littore egentem     excepi”      and i only trust you may not hereafter at any time have to     complete the sentence in regard to me—      “et regui demens in parte locavi”144      you received me with kindness indulgence generosity and i may     even say with some measure of confidence and the relation between     us has assumed such a form that you can never be my debtors but     that i must for ever be in your debt   the closing sentences became memorable “you cannot fight against the future” he exclaimed with a thrilling gesture “time is on our side the great social forces which move onwards in their might and majesty and which the tumult of our debates does not for a moment impede or disturb—those great social forces are against you they are marshalled on our side and the banner which we now carry in this fight though perhaps at some moment it may droop over our sinking heads yet it soon again will float in the eye of heaven and it will be borne by the firm hands of the united people of the three kingdoms perhaps not to an easy but to a certain and to a not far distant victory”  m58 a drama as good critics tell us is made not by words but by situations the same is the truth of the power of the orator here the speaker’s trope was a sounding battlecry not a phrase it disclosed both a cause and a man for the hour neither man nor cause prospered neither fervour nor force of argument prevailed against the fears and resentments of the men of what mr bright called the cave of adullam “to which every one was invited who was distressed and every one who was discontented” after eight nights of debate april 27 lord grosvenor was beaten and ministers were saved—but only by the desperate figure of five some thirty of the professed supporters of government voted against their leaders a scene of delirious triumph followed the announcement of the numbers and mr lowe believed for the moment that he had really slain the horrid demogorgon two men knew much better—the leader of the house and the leader of the opposition  the cabinet which was not without an imitation cave of its own hesitated for an hour or two but the two chief men in it stood firm mr gladstone was as resolute as lord russell that this time nobody should say reform was only being played with and they both insisted on going on with the bill the chances were bad for this was a palmerstonian parliament and the gladstonian hour had not yet struck as an honourable leader among the conservatives admitted not one of the divisions against the bill was taken in good faith if mr gladstone gave way he was taunted with cringing if he stood his ground it was called bullying if he expressed a desire to consult the views of the house mr disraeli held up ministers to scorn as unhappy men without minds of their own in introducing the bill says mr gladstone “i struggled with studious care to avoid every word that could give offence” the only effect of this was to spread the tale that he was not in earnest and did not really care for the bill such was the temper in which ministers were met and the whole operation was conducted upon the basis of a solemn firm and formal understanding between the regular opposition and the cave men that were it proposed to reduce the ten pound qualification no lower than nine pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence even that change should be resisted  meanwhile for the leader of the house vexation followed vexation “the worst incident in the history of our reform struggle” mr gladstone wrote to the prime minister from the house on may 28 “has occurred tonight a most barefaced proposal further to load the bill by an instruction to insert clauses respecting bribery has been carried against us by a majority of 10 the numbers were 248 to 238 this is extremely discouraging and it much reduces the usual strength and authority of the government this defeat alters our position with reference to fresh defeats” the air was thick with ideas and schemes for getting rid of the bill and yet keeping the ministers “i cannot” mr gladstone says to lord russell june 4 “divest such ideas and proposals of the aspect of dishonour” they were told he said to introduce an amended plan next year how would the case be altered they would have to introduce a plan substantially identical to meet the same invidious opposition made all the more confident by the success of its present manœuvres  at length an end came on june 18 on a question raised by lord dunkellin of rateable value as against gross estimated rental for the basis of the new sevenpound franchise ministers were beaten the numbers were 315 against 304 and in this majority of 11 against government were found no fewer than 44 of their professed supporters the sensation was almost beyond precedent “with the cheering of the adversary there was shouting violent flourishing of hats and other manifestations which i think novel and inappropriate” mr gladstone says the next morning in a note to a friend he observed “the government has now just overlived its seven years a larger term than the life of any government of this country since that of lord liverpool many circumstances show that it was time things should come to a crisis—none so much as the insidious proceedings and the inconstant and variable voting on this bill”  m59 it had been decided in the cabinet a couple of days before this defeat that an adverse vote on the narrow issue technically raised by lord dunkellin was not in itself to be treated in debate as a vital question for the rating value could easily have been adjusted to the figure of rental proposed by the government the debate however instead of being confined to a narrow question raised technically covered the whole range of the bill taken together with the previous attempts to get rid of the thing and the increasing number of the disaffected all this seemed to extinguish hope and after what had been said about crossing rubicons and burning boats most thought no course open but resignation they might appeal to the country but mr brand the expert whip told the prime minister that he felt so strongly on the impolicy of dissolution that he could not bring himself to take a part in it the proceeding would be unpopular with their own friends who had been put to great expense at their election only a few months before it would moreover break the party because at an election they would have to bring out men of more extreme views to fight the whigs and liberals who had deserted them on reform and who might thus be driven permanently to the other side such were the arguments though mr gladstone seems not to have thought them decisive at hardly any crisis in his life i think did mr gladstone ever incline to surrender short of absolute compulsion to yield was not his temper when he looked back upon this particular transaction in later years he blamed himself and his colleagues for too promptly acquiescing in advice to throw down the reins       i incline to believe that we too readily accepted our defeat by an     infinitesimal majority as a ground for resignation there were at     least four courses open to us first resignation secondly     dissolution thirdly to deny the finality of the judgment and     reverse the hostile vote on report fourthly to take shelter     under a general vote of confidence which mr crawford mp for     the city of london was prepared to move of these the last was     the worst as disparaging to political character lord russell     secretly conscious i suppose that he had arrived at the last     stage of his political existence and desirous that it should not     be forcibly abbreviated inclined to adopt it granville and i     were so decidedly set against it that we allowed ourselves i     think to be absorbed in its defeat and set up against it what     was undoubtedly the readiest and simplest expedient namely     immediate withdrawal to dissolve would have been a daring act an     appeal from a shuffling parliament to an unawakened people yet it     is possible even probable that such an appeal unhesitatingly     made would have evoked a response similar though not equal to     that of 1831 or again a retrial of the question with a call of     the house would in all likelihood have resulted in victory by     our retirement we opened the door for that series of curious     deceptions and intrigues within the tory party which undoubtedly     accelerated the arrival of household suffrage   m60 lord russell tendered their resignation to the queen then far away at balmoral the queen received the communication with the greatest concern and asked them to reconsider “the state of europe” she said “was dangerous the country was apathetic about reform the defeat had only touched a matter of detail the question was one that could never be settled unless all sides were prepared to make concessions” in london three or four days were passed in discussing the hundred ingenious futilities by which wellmeaning busybodies on all such occasions struggle to dissolve hard facts by soft words in compliance with the queen’s request the cabinet reopened their own discussion and for a day or two entertained the plan of going on if the house would pass a general vote of confidence mr gladstone as we have seen was on the morrow of the defeat for resignation and from the first he thought ill of the new plan the true alternatives were to try either a fresh parliament or a fresh ministry bright—not then a member of the government—wrote to mr gladstone june 24 in strong terms in favour of having a new parliament mr brand he says “makes no allowance for the force of a moral contest through the country for a great principle and a great cause last easter showed how much feeling your appeals could speedily arouse i do not believe in your being beaten besides there is something far worse than a defeat namely to carry on your government with a party poisoned and enfeebled by the baseness of the forty traitors elsewhere in the same letter called the ‘forty thieves’ in great contingencies something must be risked you will have a great party well compacted together and great future mr brand’s figures should be forgotten for the moment you must not forget the concluding passage of your great speech on the second reading of the bill read it again to nerve you to your great duty” the duke of argyll was strong in the same sense he saw no chance of “conducting opposition with decent sincerity or possible success except in a parliament in which we know who are our friends and who are our enemies on this question” in the end resignation carried the day—       june 25—cabinet 2½4½  the final position appeared to be     this as to alternatives before the cabinet 1 dissolution only     approved by three or four 2 a vote of confidence with vague     assurances as to future reform—desired by seven one more     acquiescing reluctantly six opposing w e g unable to act on     it 3 lord russell’s proposal to rehabilitate the     clause—disapproved by seven approved by six two ready to     acquiesce 4 resignation generally accepted hardly any strongly     dissenting i have had a great weight on me in these last days     and am glad the matter draws near its close   this decision greeted the queen on her arrival at windsor on the morning of june 26 both the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer had audiences the same day “off at 1130 to windsor with lord russell much conversation with him single and joint audiences with the queen who showed every quality required by her station and the time we had warm receptions at both stations” mr gladstone’s memorandum of the interview is as follows—       windsor castle june 26—hm expressed her regret that this     crisis could not be averted stated she had wished that this     question could have been postponed altogether to another year or     that upon finding the strength and tenacity of the opposition to     the measure it could have been withdrawn i reminded hm that     she had early expressed to me her hope that if we resumed the     subject of the reform of parliament we should prosecute it to its     completion also i said that in my opinion from all the     miscarriages attending the past history of this question not     ministries alone and leaders of parties nor parties alone but     parliament itself and parliamentary government were discredited     the queen was impressed with this and said there was certainly     great force in it she had previously seen lord russell and spoke     of his proposal further to amend the clause such a proposal she     considered advisable subject to two conditions 1 the general     assent and concurrence of the cabinet 2 the reasonable chance     of its being carried if the proposal were made she was quite     willing it should be said with the approval of the cabinet that     she had observed that the issue taken was on a point apparently     one of detail and that it was just to the h of c that it should     have an opportunity of voting upon the substance lord russell     wished in any case to state and hm approved that the queen had     founded her hesitation to accept the resignation 1 on the fact     that the decision was on a matter of detail 2 on the state of     the continent145 and the difficulty of bringing a new ministry     in such a state of things at once into the position of the old     the queen offered to write what she had said about lord russell’s     proposed amendment lord russell waived this but thinking it     desirable i afterwards revived the question and hm said she     thought it would be better and went to do it      i said to lord russell “it is singular that the same members of     the cabinet generally speaking who were prematurely eager for     resignation after the division on lord grosvenor’s motion are now     again eager to accept almost anything in the way of a resolution     as sufficient to warrant our continuing in office” he replied     “yes but i am afraid at the root of both proceedings there is a     great amount of antipathy to our reform bill they were anxious to     resign when resignation would have been injurious to it and now     they are anxious to avoid resignation because resignation will be     beneficial to it” lord russell showed me a letter he had written     to clarendon justifying me for my unwillingness to accept mr     crawford’s motion of confidence he also said that if the queen     should desire the revival of his plan for a further vote he     thought it ought to be proposed   “on returning” mr gladstone enters in the diary “we went to consult brand and then to the cabinet when resignation was finally decided on and a telegram was sent to windsor at six i went down and made my explanation for the government i kept to facts without epithets but i thought as i went on that some of the words were scorching a crowd and great enthusiasm in palace yard on departure” lord derby was sent for accepted the royal commission and finding mr lowe and the adullamites not available he formed his third administration on regular conservative lines with mr disraeli as its foremost man       july 6—went to windsor to take my leave hm short but kind     h of c on return took my place on the opposition bench the     first time for fifteen years146  finished in downing street     left my keys behind me somehow it makes a void july 19—h of     c made a little dying speech on reform sept 14— woburn     morning sederunt with lord russell and brand on reform and other     matters we agreed neither to egg on the government nor the     reverse   m61 turbulent scenes had already occurred in the metropolis and it speedily became evident that whatever value the workmen might set on the franchise for its own sake they would not brook the refusal of it they chose mr gladstone for their hero for as a good observer remarked he was the first official statesman who had convinced the working classes that he really cared for them on the occasion of one popular assemblage the crowd thronged june 28 to carlton house terrace shouting for gladstone and liberty the head of the house was away police officers sent up word to mrs gladstone that the multitude would speedily disperse if she would appear for a moment or two on the balcony in compliance with their request and for the public convenience she appeared and all passed off the incident was described by newspapers that ought to have known better as the ladies of his family courting an ovation from persons of the lowest class mr gladstone was compared to wilkes and lord george gordon with characteristic tenacity he thought it worth while to contradict the story but not in the columns where the offensive tale had been invented in july declining an invitation to speak at a demonstration in hyde park mr gladstone said he believed the resignation of the government to be a fresh and important step towards final success “in the hour of defeat i have the presentiment of victory”  an interesting glimpse of mr gladstone in the height of these distractions is given in a passage from the diaries of mr adams still the american minister—147       thursday 7th june 1866—the other evening at the queen’s ball     mrs gladstone asked me as from her husband to come to breakfast     this morning at the same time that colonel holmes148 was     invited i decided to go i found no cause to regret the     decision for the company was very pleasant the duke and duchess     of argyll lord lyttelton lord houghton lord frederick cavendish     with his wife and one of his uncles and several whom i did not     know i forgot lord dufferin we sat at two round tables thus     dividing the company but mr gladstone took ours which made all     the difference in the world his characteristic is the most     extraordinary facility of conversation on almost any topic with a     great command of literary resources which at once gives it a high     tone lord houghton if put to it is not without aptness in     keeping it up whilst the duke of argyll was stimulated out of his     customary indifference to take his share thus we passed from     politics the house of commons and mr mill to english prose as     illustrated from the time of milton and bacon down to this day     and contrasted with german which has little of good and with     french in the latter connection mr gladstone asked me if i had     read the conscrit of erckmannchatrian luckily for me who have     little acquaintance with the light current literature i could say     “yes” and could contrast it favourably with the artificial manner     of hugo it is a cause of wonder to me how a man like gladstone     so deeply plunged in the current of politics and in the duties of     legislation and official labour can find time to keep along with     the ephemeral literature abroad as well as at home after an hour     thus spent we rose and on a question proposed by colonel holmes     respecting a group of figures in china which stood in a corner     mr gladstone launched forth into a disquisition on that topic     which he delights in and illustrated his idea of the art by     showing us several specimens of different kinds one a grotesque     but speaking figure in capo di monte another a group of     combatants two of whom were lying dead with all the aspect of     strained muscle stiffening and lastly a very classical and     elegant set of wedgwood ware certainly finer than i ever saw     before this is the pleasantest and most profitable form of     english society   towards the close of the session july 21 mr gladstone presided over the annual dinner of the club founded in honour of cobden who had died the year before as might have been foretold he emphasised the moral rather than the practical results of cobden’s work “public economy was with cobden” he said “nothing less than a moral principle the temper and spirit of mr cobden in respect to questions of public economy was a temper and a spirit that ought to be maintained encouraged and propagated in this country—a temper and spirit far more in vogue far more honoured and esteemed and cultivated by both political parties twenty or thirty years ago than it is at the present moment” an intense love of justice a singleness of aim a habit of judging men fairly and estimating them favourably an absence of the suspicion that so often forms the bane of public life—these elements and all other such elements were to be found in the character of cobden abundantly supplied mr cobden’s was a mind incapable of entertaining the discussion of a question without fully weighing and estimating its moral aspects and results in these words so justly applied to cobden the orator was doubtless depicting political ideals of his own    ii   in the autumn mr gladstone determined on going abroad with his wife and daughters “one among my reasons for going” he told mr brand “is that i think i am better out of the way of politics during the recess in england i should find it most difficult to avoid for five minutes attending some public celebration or other especially in lancashire i think that i have said already in one way or other all that i can usefully say perhaps more than all so far as i am concerned i now leave the wound of the liberal party to the healing powers of nature if we cannot arrive in sufficient strength at a definite understanding with respect to the mode of handling the question of the franchise then our line ought to be great patience and quietude in opposition if we can then certainly the existing government might at any time disappear after the opening of the session i mean with advantage” “the journey to italy” says phillimore “was really a measure of selfdefence to escape the incessant persecution of correspondence suggestions and solicitations”  m62 they left england in the last week of september and proceeded direct to rome the queen had given as one good reason against a change of ministers the dangerous outlook on the continent of europe this was the year of the seven weeks’ war the battle of sadowa july 3 and the triumph of prussia over austria foreshadowing a more astonishing triumph four years hence one of the results of sadowa was the further consolidation of the italian kingdom by the transfer of venetia rome still remained outside the political situation was notoriously provisional and unstable and the french troops who had gone there in 1849 were still in their barracks at the castle of st angelo but this was no immediate concern of his “nothing can be more unlikely” he wrote to acton sept 11 “than that i should meddle with the prisons or anything else of the kind the case of rome in 1866 is very different from that of naples in 1850 when the whole royal government was nothing but one gross and flagrant illegality i have seen archbishop manning repeatedly” he continues “and my impression is that he speaks to me after having sought and received his cue from rome he is to put me in communication with cardinal antonelli and others i consider myself bound to good conduct in a very strict sense of the word” we now know that the archbishop took pains to warn his friends at rome to show their visitor all the kindness possible “gladstone” he wrote “does not come as an enemy and may be made friendly or he might become on his return most dangerous” the liberals would be very jealous of him on the subject of the temporal power of the pope meanwhile gladstone fully held that the holy father must be independent “towards us in england” said manning “and towards ireland he is the most just and forgiving of all our public men he is very susceptible of any kindness and his sympathies and respect religiously are all with us”149       to the duchess of sutherland      rome oct 13—we had for five days together last week i will     not say a surfeit or a glut for these imply excess and satiety     but a continuous feast of fine scenery all the way from     pontarlier by neuchâtel to lucerne and then by the st gothard to     como since then we have had only the passage of the apennines by     the railway from ancona to rome this is much finer than the old     road according to my recollection it has three grand stages one     of them rising from the north and east the others through close     defiles from foligno to terni and from spoleto to narni where we     went close by the old bridge as to the st gothard i think it the     finest in scenery of all the alpine passes i have seen and i have     seen all those commonly traversed from the stelvio downwards in     height to the brenner except the bernardina a part of the     ascent on the italian side may perhaps compete with the via mala     which it somewhat resembles we were also intensely delighted with     the lake of lugano which i had never seen before and which     appeared to me the most beautiful of the italian lakes      here we find rome solitary which we wished but also wet and     dirty which we did not we hope it will soon be clear and dry no     scenery and no city can stand the stripping off its robe of     atmosphere and rome which is not very rich in its natural     features suffers in a high degree we caught sight of the pope     yesterday on the steps of st peter’s made our obeisance and     received that recognition with the hand which is very appropriate     and i imagine to him not at all troublesome next week i hope to     see cardinal antonelli we have been today to st paul’s its     space is amazing and at particular points it seems to vie with or     exceed st peter’s but there can be no real comparison in     magnificence and st peter’s is the more churchlike of the two     the exterior of st paul’s beyond the walls is very mean indeed     and is in glaring contrast with the gorgeousness within      rome oct 30— i observe reserve in conversation except     with such persons as cardinals to two of them who wished me to     speak freely i have spoken without any restraint about the great     question immediately pending here and next to them my most free     and open conversation has been with the pope but of course i did     not go further than he led me and on the affairs of italy this     was nearly all the way i have seen him twice once in an audience     quattr’ occhi and once with my wife and daughters lady a     stanley accompanying us nothing can be more pleasant than the     impression made by his demeanour and language he looks well and     strong but seems to have a slight touch of deafness150 you ask     about our “apartment” and i send you partly to inform the     argylls in the hope that they might take one of the floors first     a sketch of our general position nearly opposite the europa and     secondly a rude plan of the rooms half a bedroom unfortunately is     cut off from bad management and the frattina rooms are much too     small besides three rooms which we occupy there is another which     we do not we are boarded too which saves much trouble and we     have the stanleys here we go quietly about our work of seeing     rome the vatican has been much enriched since i was here the     sculpture gallery is really wonderful in its superiority to all     others i think if i were allowed to choose two pieces i should     perhaps take the demosthenes and the torso the pictures have also     secured valuable additions the palace of the caesars since the     french scavi not by any means finished yet offers a new world     to view and we expect to see another probably next week in the     catacombs among modern works seen as yet i am most pleased with     tenerani’s psyche fainting a german löwenthal has done a very     good picture of gibson and there has come up a singularly     interesting portrait believed to be of harvey but it is idle to     attempt to write of all the beauties and the marvels the church     here is satisfactory the new clergyman mr crowther introduced     himself on sunday with an admirable sermon we expect the     clarendons tonight we do dante every morning and are in the     sixteenth canto      dec 4—at last we have got the argylls and i need not say what     an addition they are even amidst the surpassing and absorbing     interests that surround us i hope for your approbation in that i     have recommended to his notice a beautiful set of old sèvres     dinner plates soft paste which with great spirit he has     purchased for little more i believe than half what the     proprietor refused for them a while ago i shall be much     disappointed if you do not think them a valuable acquisition i     own that i should never have passed them on to a second purchaser     had i not when i first saw them already got much too near the     end of my own little tether but sèvres plates and all other     ’objects’ are of small interest in comparison with the great     events that hang as great thick clouds in the heaven around us     yet tipped with broad gleams of light today we are at length     assured unconditionally of the departure of the french in which i     believed already on some grounds including this that general     count montebello had ordered sixteen boxes to be packed with the     spoils of rome or his share of them this departure of the might     of france represented in the garrison takes a weight off roman     wills and energies which has for seventeen years bowed them to     the ground with what kind of bound will they spring up again and     what ugly knocks may be given in the process   the trip was not in every respect successful on christmas day he writes to brand “we have had some discomforts our apartments twice on fire a floor burnt through each time then i was laid down with a most severe influenza very sore throat a thing quite new to me the roman climate is as bad for me as can be” i have been told by one who saw much of the party during the roman visit that mr gladstone seemed to care little or not at all about wonders of archaeology alike in christian and pagan rome but never wearied of hearing italian sermons from priests and preaching friars this was consonant with the whole temper of his life he was a collector of ivories of china of wedgwood but in architecture in all its high historic bearings i never found him very deeply interested i doubt if he followed the controversies about french gothic and italian about byzantine and romanesque with any more concern than he had in the controversies of geology he had two audiences of pope pius ix as we have seen as had others of his colleagues then in rome and mr gladstone used to tell with much glee in what diverse fashion they impressed the pontiff “i like but i do not understand mr gladstone” the pope said “mr cardwell i understand but i do not like i both like and understand lord clarendon the duke of argyll i neither understand nor like” he saw ten of the cardinals and at florence he had an audience of the king “who spoke very freely” he had two long interviews with ricasoli and some forty or fifty members of the italian parliament gave him the honour of a dinner at which poerio made a most eloquent speech to the duchess of sutherland he wrote—       florence jan 13 1867—yesterday argyll cardwell and i went     to the king he spoke with an astounding freedom freely     concerning the pope and the emperor hopeful about italy in     general rather feebly impressed with the financial difficulty     and having his head stuffed full of military notions which it     would be very desirable to displace we have rumours from england     of reform and of no reform but we do not trouble ourselves     overmuch about these matters tomorrow i am to be entertained by     a number of the deputies in memory especially of the naples     letters i shrank from this as i have long ago been much     overpraised and overpaid for the affair but i could not find a     proper ground for refusing the dinner is to be a private one but     i suppose some notice of it will find its way into the journals     it is a curious proof of the way in which a free and open press     has taken hold here that the newspapers are ordinarily habitually     cried in the streets until near midnight   m63 among other objects of his keen and active interest was the preservation for its established uses of the famous monastery founded by st benedict thirteen centuries before at monte cassino—the first home of that great rule and institute which for long ages played so striking part in the history of civilisation in the western world he now visited monte cassino in the company of padre tosti the historian of this venerable nursery of learning was his friend long before now—they met first at naples in 1850—and he had induced mr gladstone to subscribe for the reparation of the tomb of the founder in 1863 dean stanley visited the monastery with a letter from mr gladstone “it secured for me not only the most hospitable reception but an outpouring of padre tosti’s whole soul on pope and church and italy and europe past and present in an almost unbroken conversation of three hours” in 1866 it seemed as if the hand of the italian government were about to fall as heavily on monte cassino as on any other monastic establishment mr gladstone besides doing his best with ricasoli and others wrote a letter of admirable spirit to his friend sir james lacaita—       it seems he said as if one of the lamps of learning were put     out much promise for the future extinguished and a sacred link     of union with the past broken if it be asked why englishmen     should speak and feel on this italian subject my answer would be     this that the foundation and history of monte cassino have the     interest for us which the americans of the states feel in alfred     in edward iii in henry v they are part of the great current of     italian civilisation which has been diffused and distributed over     all european lands much of my life has been devoted to the     promotion of public wealth and of that vast exterior activity     which distinguishes the age but i am deeply anxious for the     preservation of all those centres not too numerous at which the     power of thought may be cultivated and the inner and higher life     of man maintained it has as you know been pressed upon me that     i should endeavour to make a respectful appeal to the italian     government on this subject through the medium of a discussion in     the house of commons but i shrink from taking such a course as i     fear that the general effect might be to present all appearance of     intrusive and impertinent interference with the affairs of a     foreign country and that the very country towards which i should     least wish to offer the appearance of a slight i cannot likewise     refuse to cherish the hope that the enlightened mind of baron     ricasoli and his colleagues may lead them either to avert or     mitigate this blow   on his return he passed through paris the previous year a signal honour had been bestowed upon him by the illustrious institute of france—founded on that academy in which richelieu had crowned the fame of arms and statesmanship by honour to purity in national language and competence in letters151 in acknowledging the election he wrote to mignet the historian then perpetual secretary—       11 carlton house terrace march 9 1865—i have already     expressed although in an imperfect manner to your distinguished     colleagues count wolowski and m guizot the sentiments of     gratitude with which i accept the signal and most unexpected     honour of my election as a foreign associate of the institute of     france even the pressure and what i might call the tumult of my     daily occupations do not render me insensible to the nature of     this distinction which carries with it a worldwide fame i will     not however dwell further on the nature of the honour or on my     own unworthiness to receive it except to refer for a moment to     the gentleman whose name was placed in competition with my own i     cannot but be aware of his superior claims i fear that for once     the judgment of the academy has erred and that in preferring me     to mr mill its suffrages have taken a wrong direction i am only     consoled by reflecting that such a body with such renown and     with its ranks so filled can afford to suffer the detriment     attaching to a single mistake i have the honour to be etc   m64 this distinction brought with it the duty of attending the funeral of a writer eminent among the philosophers and men of letters of his day it had been said of him that three days in the week he was absurd three days mediocre and one day sublime the verdict seems to be confirmed       jan 23—from 10 to 345 at the successive stages of victor     cousin’s interment in my character of member of the institute it     was of great interest i saw many most eminent frenchmen so many     that they remained as a cloud upon my recollection except     berryer thiers and some whom i had known before jan     26—attended the meeting of the institute 122 spent the rest of     the afternoon with m jules simon in seeing certain quarters of     paris   “yesterday” he wrote to mr brand jan 27 “a dinner was given to cardwell and me at the grand hotel by the society of political economists of france and i did my best to improve the occasion in terms which might imply censure on the military measures here and the new turn of affairs also i am a known accomplice of m fould’s so i let all this be balanced by dining with the emperor today and with rouher tomorrow” of the reception at court he says “dined at the tuileries and was surprised at the extreme attention and courtesy of both their majesties with whom i had much interesting conversation” the fates with no halting foot were drawing near the palace was a heap of ashes host and hostess were forlorn exiles before in no long span of time they met their guest again     chapter xiv the struggle for household suffrage 1867       first of all we had a general intimation and promise that     something would be done then a series of resolutions which     strutted a brief hour upon the stage and then disappeared then     there was a bill which we were told on the authority of a     cabinet minister was framed in ten minutes and which was     withdrawn in very little more than ten minutes and lastly there     was a bill which—undergoing the strangest transformations in its     course through parliament—did i will not say become the law of     the land but was altered into something like that which became     the law of the land—gladstone    i   from rome mr gladstone kept a watchful eye for the approaching political performances at westminster he had written to mr brand a month after his arrival—       51 p di spagna oct 30 ’66—the clarendons are to be here     this evening to stay for a fortnight or three weeks dean and lady     a stanley are in the house with us i doubt if there are any     other english parties in rome      the reform movement is by degrees complicating the question it is     separating bright from us and in one sense thus clearing our way     but then it may become too strong for us or at least too strong     to be stayed with our bill of last year i do not envy lord derby     and his friends their reflections this autumn on the course they     have pursued meanwhile i wish that our press as far as we may be     said to have one would write on this text that a bill from     them to be accepted by the people must be larger and not     smaller than would have been or even would be accepted from     us for confidence or credit stands in politics in lieu of     ready money if indeed your enemy is stronger than you are you     must take what he gives you but in this case he is weaker and     not stronger a good bill from them would save us much trouble and     anxiety a straightforward bill such an £8 franchise without     tricks would be easily dealt with but their bill will be neither     good nor straightforward the mind of disraeli as leader of the     house of commons and standing as he does among his compeers will     predominate in its formation now he has made in his lifetime     three attempts at legislation—the budget of 1852 the india bill     of 1858 the reform bill of 1859 all have been thoroughly     tortuous measures and the ethiopian will not change his skin his     reform bill of 1867 will be tortuous too but if you have to drive     a man out of a wood you must yourself go into the wood to drive     him we may have to meet a tortuous bill by a tortuous motion     this is what i am afraid of and what i am for one above all     things anxious to avoid in 1859 the liberal party had to play the     obstructive and with evil consequences it would be most     unfortunate if they should be put into such a position again pray     consider this i do not like what i see of bright’s speeches we     have no claim upon him more than the government have on us and i     imagine he will part company the moment he sees his way to more     than we would give him    ii   m65 the general character of the operations of 1867 certainly one of the most curious in our parliamentary history was described by mr gladstone in a fragment written thirty years after time had extinguished the volcanic fires and the little outline is sketched with temper and a sort of neutrality—       when the parliament reassembled in 1867 parties and groups were     curiously distributed the two great bodies were the regular     supporters of the tory ministry and those grouped around us who     had been expelled the first did not know what course they would     have to take that depended on the secret counsels of another     mind to keep to the drapeau was the guiding motive as has been     since the creed and practice of peel were subverted by the     opposite principles of disraeli who on a franchise question had     his peer colleagues at his feet besides these other divisions     had to be recognised the salisbury secession from the government     supported by sir w heathcote and beresford hope was high in     character but absolutely insignificant in numbers there was     lowe so great among the adullamites of 1866 but almost alone     among them in the singleness and strength of his opposition to     reform there was the bulk of the adullamite body unable to place     themselves in declared opposition to the liberal mass but many of     them disposed to tamper with the question and to look kindly on     the tory government as the power which would most surely keep down     any enlargement of the franchise to its minimum it would be idle     to discuss the successive plans submitted by the government to the     house of commons with an unexampled rapidity the governing idea     of the man who directed the party seemed to be not so much to     consider what ought to be proposed and carried as to make sure     that whatever it was it should be proposed and carried by those     now in power the bill on which the house of commons eventually     proceeded was a measure i should suppose without precedent or     parallel as on the other hand it was for the purpose of the     hour and as the work of a government in a decided minority an     extraordinary stroke of parliamentary success our position on     the other hand was this 1 we felt that if household suffrage     were to be introduced into the boroughs it ought to be a real     household suffrage 2 the existing state of our legislation     under which a large majority of the householders made no     disbursement of rates but paid them without distinction in their     rent showed that a bill professedly for household suffrage but     taking no notice of compounding would be in the first place a     lottery and in the second an imposture some towns would have     large enfranchisement some none at all and no principle but the     accidental state of local law would determine on which side of the     line any town was to be found and the aggregate result would be     ludicrously small as a measure of enfranchisement of such a     measure we could not approve we did not wish to make at once so     wide a change as that involved in a genuine household suffrage     always in our minds involving county as well as town and we     could not fairly separate ourselves from bright on such a point     3 so we adhered to our idea of an extension considerable but     not violent and performing all it promised      but the adullamite spirit went to work and finding that the bill     had the popular recommendation of a great phrase household     suffrage combined with the recommendation to them of a narrow     sphere of practical operation determined to support the principle     of the bill and abandon our plan although our mode of operation     had been warmly approved at party meetings held at my house the     result was in a tactical sense highly damaging to us perhaps we     ought to have recognised that the idea of household suffrage when     the phrase had once been advertised by a government as its     battleground was irresistible and that the only remaining     choice was whether it should be a household suffrage cribbed     cabined and confined by the condition of personal ratepaying or     a household suffrage fairly conforming in substance and operation     to the idea that the phrase conveyed the first was in our view     totally inadmissible the second beyond the wants and wishes of     the time but the government it must be admitted bowled us over     by the force of the phrase and made it our next duty to bowl them     over by bringing the reality of the bill into correspondence with     its great profession this we were able to do in some degree when     we reached the committee for some of the restrictions included in     the measure were such as the doublefacing liberal fringe did not     venture to uphold against the assaults of their own party but the     grand question of compound householding which was really to     determine the character of our legislation was one on which we     could not reckon upon either the conscientious or the intimidated     and prudential support of our liberal fringe the government were     beyond all doubt at least for the moment masters of the     situation the question was raised if not in its fullest breadth     yet in a form of considerable efficiency by a proposal from mr     hodgkinson member for newark and a local solicitor little known     in the house152 he went there to support it but without an     idea that it could be carried and anticipating its defeat by a     majority of a hundred never have i undergone a stranger emotion     of surprise than when as i was entering the house our whip met     me and stated that disraeli was about to support hodgkinson’s     motion but so it was and the proposition was adopted without     disturbance as if it had been an affair of trivial importance      how it came about i partially learned at a later date a cabinet     was held after the fact which sir john lambert the great     statistician of the day was summoned to attend the cabinet had     had no idea that the hodgkinson amendment was to be accepted the     acceptance was the sole act of mr disraeli and when it had been     done the ministers assembled in order to learn from sir john     lambert what was the probable addition that it would make to the     constituency      i do not suppose that in the whole history of the ’mysteryman’     this proceeding can be surpassed the tories having been brought     to accept household suffrage on the faith of the limitation     imposed by personal payment of the rates found at a moment’s     notice that that limitation had been thrown overboard and that     their leader had given them a bill virtually far larger than any     that mr bright had sought to impose upon them it was certainly     no business of ours to complain and they made it no business of     theirs i imagine that they still relied upon rectification of the     bill by the house of lords and the lords did rectify it largely     but these rectifications were all rejected when the bill returned     to us except the minority representation which mr disraeli     was strong enough to secure by means of the votes of a body of     liberals who approved it and which he accepted to humour or     comfort the lords a little while he detested it and made as     bright said the best speech ever delivered against it so came     about the establishment of an effective household suffrage in the     cities and boroughs of england    iii   m66 the process effecting this wide extension of political power to immense classes hitherto without it was in every respect extraordinary the great reform was carried by a parliament elected to support lord palmerston and lord palmerston detested reform it was carried by a government in a decided minority it was carried by a minister and by a leader of opposition neither of whom was at the time in the full confidence of his party finally it was carried by a house of commons that the year before had in effect rejected a measure for the admission of only 400000 new voters while the measure to which it now assented added almost a million voters to the electorate153  we always do best to seek rational explanations in large affairs it may be true that “if there were no blunders there would be no politics” but when we have made full allowance for blunder caprice chance folly craft still reason and the nature of things have a share the secret of the strange reversal in 1867 of all that had been said attempted and done in 1866 would seem to be that the tide of public opinion had suddenly swelled to flood the same timidity that made the ruling classes dread reform had the compensation that very little in the way of popular demonstration was quite enough to frighten them into accepting it here the demonstration was not little riots in hyde park street processions measured by the mile in the great cities from london up to glasgow openair meetings attended by a hundred two hundred two hundred and fifty thousand people at birmingham manchester leeds showed that even though the workmen might not be anxious to demand the franchise yet they would not stand its refusal in the autumn of 1868 mr bright led a splendid campaign in a series of speeches in england scotland and ireland marked by every kind of power it is worthy of remark that not one of the main changes of that age was carried in parliament without severe agitation out of doors catholic emancipation was won by o’connell the reform act of 1832 by the political unions free trade by the league against the corn law household suffrage followed the same rule  it was undoubtedly true in a sense that mr gladstone was at the head of a majority in 1866 and now again in 1867 but its composition was peculiar sir thomas acland april 10 1867 describes mr gladstone as hampered by three sets of people “1 radicals who will vote for household suffrage but don’t want it carried 2 whigs aristocrats who won’t risk a collision with the government and hope that very little reform will be carried and want to discredit gladstone 3 a large body who care for nothing except to avoid a dissolution” “there is a fresh intrigue” he adds “every twelve hours”  the trenchant and sardonic mind of the leader of the revolt that had destroyed the bill of 1866 soon found food for bitter rumination on the eve of the session lowe admitted that he had very little hope of a successful end to his efforts and made dismal protests that the reign of reason was over in other words he had found out that the men whom he had placed in power were going to fling him overboard in what he called this miserable auction between two parties at which the country was put up for sale and then knocked down to those who could produce the readiest and swiftest measure for its destruction  the liberal cave of the previous year was broken up lowe and the ablest of its old denizens now voting with mr gladstone but the great majority going with the government the place of the empty cave was taken by a new group of dissidents named from their habitat the party of the tearoom many both whigs above the gangway and even radicals below were averse to bringing lord russell and mr gladstone back again they thought a bill would have a better chance with the tories than with the old leaders insubordination and disorganisation were complete “i have never seen anything like it” says the new lord halifax154 “but the state of things this year enables me to understand what was very inexplicable in all i heard of last year” we can hardly wonder that the strain was often difficult to bear a friend meeting mr gladstone at dinner about this time march 25 thought that he saw signs of irritated nerve “what an invaluable gift” he reflects “a present of phlegm from the gods would be if we could roll up thompson master of trinity or bishop thirlwall with him and then bisect the compound we should get a pair as invincible as the dioscuri” an accomplished observer told his constituents that one saw the humour of the great parliamentary chess tournament looking at the pieces on the board and the face of disraeli its tragic side in a glimpse of the face of gladstone in the mephistophelian nonchalance of one the melancholy earnestness of the other155  m67 everybody knew that disraeli as he watched the scene from behind his mask now and again launching a welldevised retort was neither liked nor trusted though more than a little feared and that gladstone with his deeply lined face his “glare of contentious eagerness” his seeming overrighteousness both chafed his friends and exasperated his foes as it was excellently put by a critic in the press—the house was indifferent and mr gladstone was earnest the house was lax and he was strict it was cynical about popular equality and he was enthusiastic it was lazy about details he insisted upon teaching it the profoundest minutiæ156 about this time lord russell told lord halifax that he had gone down to see his brother the duke of bedford when he was dying and had said to him that things were drifting into the country being governed by disraeli and gladstone and the duke observed that neither of them was fit for it and halifax himself went on to say that gladstone had in truth no sympathy or connection with any considerable party in the house of commons for the old whig party remembered him as an opponent for many years the radicals knew that on many points especially on all church matters he did not agree with them and though they admired his talents and hailed his recent exertions in favour of reform they had no great attachment to him nor did he seem to be personally popular with any of them  far away from the world of politics we have an estimate of mr gladstone at this time from the piercing satirist of his age “is not he at any rate a man of principle” said a quaker lady to carlyle “oh gladstone” the sage replied “i did hope well of him once and so did john sterling though i heard he was a puseyite and so forth still it seemed the right thing for a state to feel itself bound to god and to lean on him and so i hoped that something might come of him but now he has been declaiming that england is such a wonderfully prosperous state meaning that it has plenty of money in its breeches pocket but that’s not the prosperity we want and so i say to him ‘you are not the lifegiver to england i go my way you go yours good morning with a most dramatic and final bow’ ”157 england however thought otherwise about lifegivers and made a bow of a completely different sort yet not at once it was mr disraeli who played the leading part in this great transaction not by inventing the phrase of household suffrage for that principle was mr bright’s nor by giving his bill the shape in which it ultimately became law for that shape was mainly due to mr gladstone but as the mind by whose secret counsels the arduous and intricate manœuvre was directed “the most wonderful thing” wrote bishop wilberforce at the end of the session “is the rise of disraeli it is not the mere assertion of talent he has been able to teach the house of commons almost to ignore gladstone and at present lords it over him and i am told says that he will hold him down for twenty years”158 if mr disraeli said this he proved almost as much mistaken as when fox was confident of holding the young pitt down in 1783 still he impressed his rival “i met gladstone at breakfast” says lord houghton may “he seems quite awed by the diabolical cleverness of dizzy” awe by no means the right word i fancy    iv   m68 on april 12 the first act of the reform question of 1867 ended in an awkward crisis for mr gladstone the details of the story are intricate and not much to our purpose mr gladstone’s version printed above discovers its general features some particulars properly biographic will fill up his sketch “if you have to drive a man out of a wood” mr gladstone said “you must yourself go into the wood to drive him” the bystander of a later time however may be content to keep outside the thicket until the driver and the driven both emerge mr disraeli began by preparing a series of resolutions—platitudes with little relation to realities he told the house that reform should no longer be allowed to determine the fate of cabinets and the house laughed yet if mr disraeli had only at this time enjoyed the advantage of a better character—if he had been althorp russell peel—instead of laughing his hearers would perhaps have recognised good sense and statesmanship as he said later whig prime ministers coalition prime ministers coalition chancellors of the exchequer had one after another had their innings and with a majority at their back was it not well now to try something that might be carried by consent under pressure from mr gladstone the government explained their plan dropped the resolutions and brought in a bill159 men were to have votes who had university degrees or were members of learned professions or had thirty pounds in a savings bank or fifty pounds in the funds or paid a pound in direct taxes but the fighting point was that every householder who paid rates should have a vote a scheme for seats accompanied to comfort his party for giving so wide a suffrage the minister provided checks by conferring a double vote on certain classes of citizens and imposing strict terms as to residence three members of his cabinet of whom lord cranborne was the most important refused the unsubstantial solace and resigned but mr disraeli saw that he would regain by disorganising his opponents more than he would lose by dislocating his friends  mr gladstone flew down upon the plan with energy as a measure of illusory concessions and securities still more illusory his speech was taken in some quarters in a conservative sense for lowe at once wrote to him march 21 urging him to follow it up by resisting the second reading on the principle of righting rent against rating since callimachus the athenian polemarch had to give the casting vote at marathon when the ten generals were equally divided on the question of fighting the persians or not fighting “no one” cried lowe “ever had a weightier case to decide” than mr gladstone now he forgot that the brave callimachus was slain and mr gladstone would in a political sense have been slain likewise if he had taken lowe’s advice for as he says disraeli had by talk of household suffrage “bowled them over” a meeting of 278 liberals was held at his house and he addressed them for nearly an hour concurring not overwillingly in the conclusion that they should not resist the second reading160 he had a long conversation with mr bright two days before whom he found ’sensible moderate and firm’ and whose view was no doubt the opposite of lowe’s the bill was read a second time without a division march 26  a few entries in sir robert phillimore’s journal help us to realise the state of the case during this extraordinary session—       april 9—entire collapse of gladstone’s attack on government     yesterday tearoom schism of liberal members including the h     of c russell disraeli’s insolent triumph 10—returned to the     coppice with ld richard cavendish he tells me hastings russell     and his brother cannot bear gladstone as their leader 12—in the     middle of the day saw gladstone and mrs gladstone his disgust     and deep mortification at the defection of his party mingled     with due sense of the loyalty of the greater number and     especially of his old cabinet the expression of my wish that if     deserted he will abdicate and leave them to find another leader     fully responded to by him 13—defeat of the opposition last     night great triumph of disraeli a surprise i believe to both     parties 289 voted with gladstone what will he do query—ought     he on account of the defection of 20 to leave so considerable a     party   m69 the occasion just mentioned marked a climax mr gladstone moved an amendment to remove the personal payment of rates as an essential qualification and to confer the franchise on the householder whether he paid the rate direct or through the landlord the next day the diary records april 12—“spoke in reply and voted in 289310 a smash perhaps without example a victory of 21 for ministers” a new secession had taken place and 43 liberal members voted with the government while nearly 20 were absent the cranborne secession was small and some who had been expected to stay away voted with the government “gladstone expressed himself strongly to five or six members of the late government whom he summoned to his house in the morning he spoke of retiring to a back bench and announcing that he would give up the ostensible post of leader of the opposition he was dissuaded from doing this at the present moment and went out of town as indeed did almost everybody else”161 still the notion of a back bench did lodge itself in his mind for long the “smash” was undoubtedly severe as mr gladstone wrote to one of the members for the city a supporter it showed that the liberals whose convictions allowed united action upon reform were not a majority but a minority of the house of commons considering the large number who supported his proposal he told his correspondent that though he would move no further amendment of his own he was not less willing than heretofore to remain at the service of the party “the friendly critics” he said to brand “note a tone of despondency in my letter to crawford that is all owing to granville and others who cut off a fine peacock’s tail that i had appended” so day after day amid surf and breakers he held to his oar if mr gladstone was much buffeted in the house of his friends he was not without valiant backers and among them none was more stout than mr bright the least effusive of all men in the direction of large panegyric speaking to his constituents at birmingham “who is there in the house of commons” he demanded “who equals mr gladstone in knowledge of all political questions who equals him in earnestness who equals him in eloquence who equals him in courage and fidelity to his convictions if these gentlemen who say they will not follow him have any one who is equal let them show him if they can point out any statesman who can add dignity and grandeur to the stature of mr gladstone let them produce him” a deputation against the bill from some popular body came to him may 11 mr disraeli at once regretted that these “spouters of stale sedition” these “obsolete incendiaries” should have come forward to pay their homage to one who wherever he may sit must always remain the pride and ornament of the house—       “who but must laugh if such a man there be     who would not weep if atticus were he”    v   to the duchess of sutherland mr gladstone wrote july 9—       i do not plead guilty to the indictment for “nonattendance” i     think that for three months i have been in the house for more     hours than the speaker i have heard every important word that has     been spoken on the reform bill and at least ninetenths of all     the words true outside the reform bill i only attend when i     think there is a chance of being useful and in the present state     of the house these opportunities are few i act from no personal     motive but for me to be present and interfere continuously or so     far continuously as i might in other circumstances would exhibit     needlessly from day to day the divisions and consequent weakness     of the liberal party i admit also that time tells on a man of my     age and temperament and my brain tells me that i want more rest     and not less is this unreasonable i am against all needless     waste of life or anything else everything should be husbanded i     must add that more attendance would but aggravate the     susceptibility which depends on nerves rather than will and     already makes my attendance less useful   the phillimore diary gives us one or two glimpses more—       may 9—carnarvon delighted with gladstone’s speech at spg     meeting 10—called on gladstone in bed at 130 ill from effect     of the great exertion of yesterday—spg in the

most unsatisfactory     may 9—spoke earnestly and long for compound householders in     vain beaten by 322256 much fatigued by heat and work may     28—spoke perforce on disraeli’s astonishing declaration of     consistency july 15—third reading of reform bill a remarkable     night determined at the last moment not to take part in the     debate for fear of doing mischief on our own side   the conservative leader himself was exposed to onslaughts from his followers and confederates of the previous year as severe as have ever fallen on the head of an english party “never” cried mr lowe in desolation and chagrin “never was there tergiversation so complete such conduct may fail or not it may lead to the retention or the loss of office but it merits alike the contempt of all honest men and the execration of posterity” lord cranborne the chief conservative seceder described the bill in its final shape after undergoing countless transformations as the result of the adoption of the principles of bright at the dictation of gladstone it was at mr gladstone’s demand that lodgers were invested with votes that the dual vote voting papers educational franchise savingsbank franchise all disappeared that the distribution of seats was extended into an operation of enormously larger scale in his most biting style lord cranborne deplored that the house should have applauded a policy of legerdemain talked about borrowing their ethics from the political adventurer regretted above all things that the reform bill should have been purchased at the cost of a political betrayal that had no parallel in our parliamentary annals and that struck at the very root of that mutual confidence which is the very soul of our party government  merciless storms of this kind mr disraeli bore imperturbably he complained of the intolerant character of the discussions “everybody who does not agree with somebody else is looked upon as a fool or as being mainly influenced by a total want of principle in the conduct of public affairs” he doubted whether mr bright or anybody else could show that the tory party had changed their opinions he had not changed his own opinions the bill was in harmony with the general policy they had always maintained though adapted of course to the requirements of the year on mr lowe’s “most doleful vaticinations that ever were heard” about the new voters repudiating the national debt and adopting an inconvertible paper currency he poured easy ridicule yet only a year before this mr disraeli himself had prophesied that the end of a seven pound franchise would be a parliament of no statesmanship no eloquence no learning no genius “instead of these you will have a horde of selfish and obscure mediocrities incapable of anything but mischief and that mischief devised and regulated by the raging demagogue of the hour”  mr gladstone summed the matter up in a sentence to dr pusey “we have been passing through a strange and eventful year a deplorable one i think for the character and conduct of the house of commons but yet one of promise for the country though of a promise not unmixed with evils”     chapter xv opening of the irish campaign 1868       “i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that     events have controlled me now at the end of three years’     struggle the nation’s condition is not what either party or any     man desired or expected”—abraham lincoln 1864    i   writing to his brotherinlaw lord lyttelton in april 1865 mr gladstone sets out pretty summarily the three incidents that had been taken to mark the line of his advance in the paths of extreme and visionary politics when it was written his speech on the franchise the previous year had not ripened162 and his speech on the irish church was only on the eve nor did he yet know it of taking shape as a deliberate policy of action       to lord lyttelton      11 carlton house terrace sw april 9 ’65—our interesting     conversation of wednesday evening which looked before and after     and for your share in which i heartily thank you has led me to     review the subject matters a process which every man in public     life as well as elsewhere ought often to perform but which the     pressure of overwork and the exhaustion it leaves behind sadly     hinder but i sum up in favour of a verdict of “not guilty” on     the following grounds      as far as i know there are but three subjects which have exposed     me to the charge of radicalism the irish church the franchise     the paper duty and the consequent struggle with the house of     lords      my opinions on the irish church were i know those of newcastle     and sidney herbert twenty years ago and they were not radicals     ever since maynooth in 1845 i have seen that resistance in     principle was gone that was the main reason which led me to make     such a serious affair of my own case about the maynooth grant in     that year but i held this embryo opinion in my mind as there was     no cause to precipitate it into life and waited to fortify or     alter or invalidate it by the teachings of experience at last the     time for speaking and therefore for formulating my ideas came     and i have spoken according as i believe to be the sense of all     the leading men with whom i acted from peel’s death onwards and     within the sense not only of lord macaulay but of the present     lord grey      with respect to the franchise my belief is that the objection     taken to my speech really turned not upon the doctrine of prima     facie title but upon the fact that it was a speech decisively     and warmly in favour of the £6 franchise or something equivalent     to it that is to say of the very franchise which as a member of     the cabinet i had supported in 1860 on the credit and promise of     which lord derby had been put out in 1859 and which if it did     not appear in the aberdeen reform bill of 1852 was represented     there by other concessions equally large the truth is this that     ever since the aberdeen reform bill i have remained just where it     placed me but many seem to think that it is a subject to be     played with or traded on in thinking and acting otherwise i feel     myself to be upholding principles essential to the confidence of     the people in governments and parliaments and also a measure     which promises by reasonably widening the basis of our     institutions to strengthen the structure above      to the repeal of the paper duty the house of commons when led by     the derby government chose to commit itself unanimously and this     at a time when the tea duty was at 17d per lb in 1860 and 1861     the cabinet considered the respective claims and took the same     course which the derby government had assisted the house of     commons to take before upon this it was found that the measure     which they had approved had become in my hands a radical one the     house of lords was encouraged to rescue the finance of the country     from the hands of the house of commons and the claims of tea were     declared to be paramount to those of paper in proposing the     repeal of the last remaining excise duty upon a simple article of     manufacture i adopted a principle which had already received an     unanimous acceptance in resisting to the uttermost of my power     the encroachment of the house of lords i acted as i believe on     the only principle which makes it practicable to defend the true     legitimate and constitutional powers of that house itself against     encroachment from other quarters      now let me look at the other side of the question on church     rates on university tests on clerical subscription the two last     being the only two questions really of principle which as far as     i remember have been raised i have held my ground and on the     two last the cabinet of which i form a part has in the main     adopted a course essentially but with a little c conservative   the question of franchise was settled the question of the powers of the lords in matters of taxation was settled the irish church held its ground in 1865 mr gladstone voted against a radical member who had moved that the case of the irish church “called for the early attention of the government” he agreed with the mover on the merits but did not believe that the time had come in 1866 when he was leader of the house he concurred with lord russell then first minister in meeting a motion against the irish church with a direct negative “in meeting a question with a negative” he wrote to the irish secretary april 7 “we may always put it on the ground of time as well as on the merits to meet a motion of this kind with the previous question only implies almost an engagement to take it up on some early occasion and this i take it we are not prepared for” in the summer of 1865 he wrote to the warden of glenalmond that the question was “remote and apparently out of all bearing on the practical politics of the day” so far as his own judgment went he had told sir roundell palmer in 1863 that he had made up his mind on the subject and should not be able to keep himself from giving expression to his feelings why did he say that he did not then believe that the question would come on in his time “a man” he replied “who in 1865 completed his thirtythird year of a laborious career who had already followed to the grave the remains of almost all the friends abreast of whom he had started from the university in the career of public life and who had observed that excepting two recent cases i suppose palmerston and russell it was hard to find in our whole history a single man who had been permitted to reach the fortieth year of a course of labour similar to his own within the walls of the house of commons such a man might be excused  if he formed a less sanguine estimate of the fraction of space yet remaining to him than seems to have been the case with his critics”163  it was maynooth that originally cut from under his feet the principle of establishment in ireland as an obligation of the state when that went more general reflections arose in his mind in 1872 he wrote to guizot—       it is very unlikely that you should remember a visit i paid you i     think at passy in the autumn of 1845 with a message from lord     aberdeen about international copyright the maynooth act had just     been passed its author i think meant it to be final i had     myself regarded it as seminal and you in congratulating me upon     it as i well remember said we should have the sympathies of     europe in the work of giving ireland justice—a remark which     evidently included more than the measure just passed and which i     ever after saved and pondered it helped me on towards what has     been since done   “i must own” he wrote to lord granville april 11 1868 “that for years past i have been watching the sky with a strong sense of the obligation to act with the first streak of dawn” he now believed the full sun was up and he was right in an autobiographic note undated but written near to the end of his days he says—       i am by no means sure upon a calm review that providence has     endowed me with anything that can be called a striking gift but     if there be such a thing entrusted to me it has been shown at     certain political junctures in what maybe termed appreciations of     the general situation and its result to make good the idea this     must not be considered as the simple acceptance of public opinion     founded upon the discernment that it has risen to a certain height     needful for a given work like a tide it is an insight into the     facts of particular eras and their relation one to another which     generates in the mind a conviction that the materials exist for     forming a public opinion and for directing it to a particular end     there are four occasions of my life with respect to which i think     these considerations may be applicable they are these 1 the     renewal of the incometax in 1853 2 the proposal of religious     equality for ireland 1868   the remaining two will appear in good time it is easy to label this with the illfavoured name of opportunist yet if an opportunist be defined as a statesman who declines to attempt to do a thing until he believes that it can really be done what is this but to call him a man of common sense    ii   m70 in 1867 ireland was disturbed by bold and dangerous fenian plots and the mischief flowed over into england in september at manchester a body of armed men rescued two fenian prisoners from a police van and shot an officer in charge a crime for which three of them were afterwards hanged in december a fenian rolled a barrel of gunpowder up to the wall of a prison in london where a comrade was confined and fired it the explosion that followed blew down part of the wall and cost several lives       in my opinion—mr gladstone said afterwards in parliament and     was much blamed for saying—and in the opinion of many with whom i     communicated the fenian conspiracy has had an important influence     with respect to irish policy but it has not been an influence in     determining or in affecting in the slightest degree the     convictions which we have entertained with respect to the course     proper to be pursued in ireland the influence of fenianism was     this—that when the habeas corpus act was suspended when all the     consequent proceedings occurred when the tranquillity of the     great city of manchester was disturbed when the metropolis itself     was shocked and horrified by an inhuman outrage when a sense of     insecurity went abroad far and wide  when the inhabitants of     the different towns of the country were swearing themselves in as     special constables for the maintenance of life and property—then     it was when these phenomena came home to the popular mind and     produced that attitude of attention and preparedness on the part     of the whole population of this country which qualified them to     embrace in a manner foreign to their habits in other times the     vast importance of the irish controversy164   this influence was palpable and undoubted and it was part of mr gladstone’s courage not to muffle up plain truth from any spurious notions of national selfesteem he never had much patience with people who cannot bear to hear what they cannot fail to see in this case the truth was of the plainest lord stanley then a member of his father’s government went to a banquet at bristol in the january of 1868 and told his conservative audience that ireland was hardly ever absent from the mind of anybody taking part in public affairs “i mean” he said “the painful the dangerous the discreditable state of things that unhappily continues to exist in ireland” he described in tones more fervid than were usual with him the “miserable state of things” and yet he asked “when we look for a remedy who is there to give us an intelligible answer” the state of ireland as mr gladstone said later165 was admitted by both sides to be the question of the day the conservatives in power took it up and they had nothing better nor deeper to propose than the policy of concurrent endowment they asked parliament to establish at the charge of the exchequer a roman catholic university and declared their readiness to recognise the principle of religious equality in ireland by a great change in the status of the unendowed clergy of that country provided the protestant establishment were upheld in its integrity this was the policy of levelling up it was met by a counterplan of religious equality disestablishment of the existing church without establishing any other and with a general cessation of endowments for religion in ireland mr disraeli’s was at bottom the principle of pitt and castlereagh and of many great whigs but he might have known and doubtless did know how odious it would be to the british householders who were far more like king george iii than they at all supposed    iii   m71 in may 1867 mr gladstone had told the house that the time could not be far distant when parliament would have to look the position of the irish church fairly and fully in the face in the autumn roundell palmer visited mr cardwell and discovered clearly from the conversation that the next move in the party was likely to be an attack upon the irish church the wider aspects of the irish case opened themselves to mr gladstone in all their melancholy dimensions at southport dec 19 he first raised his standard and proclaimed an irish policy on irish lines that should embrace the promotion of higher education in a backward country the reform of its religious institutions the adjustment of the rights of the cultivator of the soil the church the land the college should all be dealt with in turn166 it might be true he said that these things would not convert the irish into a happy and contented people inveterate diseases could not be healed in a moment when you have long persevered in mischief you cannot undo it at an instant’s notice true though this might be was the right conclusion that it was better to do nothing at all for his own part he would never despair of redeeming the reproach of total incapacity to assimilate to ourselves an island within three hours of our shores that had been under our dominating influence for six centuries  at christmas in 1867 lord russell announced to mr gladstone his intention not again to take office in other words to retire from the titular leadership of the liberal party mr gladstone did not deny his claim to repose “peel” he said “in 1846 thought he had secured his dismissal at an age which if spared i shall touch in three days’ time”167 lord russell was now seventyfive he once told lord granville that “the great disappointment of his life had been grey’s refusal to join his government in december 1845 which had prevented his name going down in history as the repealer of the corn laws” “a great reputation” wrote mr gladstone to granville in 1868 “built itself up on the basis of splendid public services for thirty years for almost twenty it has i fear been on the decline the movement of the clock continues the balance weights are gone”168  a more striking event than lord russell’s withdrawal was the accession of mr disraeli to the first place in the counsels of the crown in february 1868 lord derby’s health compelled him to retire from his position as head of the government mr gladstone found fault with the translator of stockmar’s memoirs for rendering “leichtsinnig” applied to lord derby as “frivolous” he preferred “lightminded”—       the difference between frivolous and lightminded is not a broad     one but in my opinion a man is frivolous by disposition or as     people say by nature whereas he is lightminded by defect or     perversity of will further he is frivolous all over he may be     lightminded on one side of his character so it was in an eminent     degree with lord derby not only were his natural gifts     unsurpassed in the present age but he had a serious and earnest     side to his character politics are at once a game and a high art     he allowed the excitements of the game to draw him off from the     sustained and exhausting efforts of the high art but this was the     occasional deviation of an honourable man not the fixed mental     habit of an unprincipled one   m72 mr disraeli became prime minister for the moment the incident was more dramatic than important it was plain that his tenure of office could not last long he was five years older perhaps more than mr gladstone his parliamentary existence had been four or five years shorter during the thirtyone years of his life in the house of commons up to now he had enjoyed three short spells of office from 1852 to 1868 covering little more than as many years he had chosen finance for his department but his budgets made no mark in foreign affairs he had no policy of his own beyond being austrian and papal rather than italian and his criticisms on the foreign policy of palmerston and russell followed the debating needs of the hour for legislation in the constructive sense in which it interested and attracted mr gladstone he had no taste and little capacity in two achievements only had he succeeded but in importance they were supreme out of the wreckage left by sir robert peel twentytwo years before he had built up a party in the name of that party called conservative he had revolutionised the base of our parliamentary constitution these two extraordinary feats he had performed without possessing the full confidence of his adherents or any real confidence at all on the part of the country that was to come later meanwhile the nation had got used to him he had culture imagination fancy and other gifts of a born man of letters the faculty of slow reflective brooding was his and he often saw both deep and far he was artificial but he was no pharisee and he was never petty his magniloquence of phrase was the expression of real size and spaciousness of character as goethe said of st peter’s at rome in spite of all the rococo there was etwas grosses something great his inexhaustible patience his active attention and industry his steadfast courage his talent in debate and the work of parliament his genius in espying employing creating political occasions all made him after prolonged conflict against impediments of every kind one of the imposing figures of his time this was the political captain with whom mr gladstone had contended for some sixteen years past and with whom on a loftier elevation for both he was to contend for a dozen years to come  on a motion about the state of ireland proceeding from an irish member march 16 1868 mr gladstone at last launched before parliament the memorable declaration that the time had come when the church of ireland as a church in alliance with the state must cease to exist this was not a mere sounding sentence in a speech it was one of the heroic acts of his life manning did not overstate the case when he wrote to mr gladstone march 28 ’68 “the irish establishment is a great wrong it is the cause of division in ireland of alienation between ireland and england it embitters every other question even the land question is exasperated by it the fatal ascendency of race over race is unspeakably aggravated by the ascendency of religion over religion” but there were many pitfalls and the ground hid dangerous fire the parliament was palmerstonian and in essence conservative both parties were demoralised by the strange and tortuous manœuvres that ended in household suffrage many liberals were profoundly disaffected to their leader nobody could say what the majority was nor where it lay to attack the irish church was to alarm and scandalise his own chosen friends and closest allies in the kindred church of england to attack a high protestant institution “exalting its mitred front” in the catholic island was to run sharp risk of awaking the sleuthhounds of nopopery the house of lords would undoubtedly fight as it did to its last ditch the legislative task itself was in complexity and detail apart from religious passion and the prejudice of race gigantic  having once decided upon this bold campaign mr gladstone entered upon it with military promptitude and pursued it with an intrepidity all his own among the statesmen of his day and not surpassed by pym in 1640 nor chatham in 1758 nor chatham’s son in 1783 nor anybody else in days gone by within a week of this historic trumpetblast he gave notice of three resolutions to the effect that the established church of ireland should cease to exist as an establishment attendant and consequential changes were appended within a week of giving notice he opened the first resolution and carried the preliminary motion by a majority of 61 the cheering at this demonstration of a united and victorious party was prodigious both within the house and in westminster hall and an enthusiastic crowd followed the leader and his two sons as they walked home to carlton house terrace “this” he wrote to the duchess of sutherland “is a day of excitement—almost of exultation we have made a step nay a stride and this stride is on the pathway of justice and of peace and of national honour and renown”169  m73 the first resolution was carried april 30 by a majority of 65 and a week later the second and third went through without a division mr disraeli fought his battle with much steadiness but did not go beyond a dilatory amendment if mr gladstone had old deliverances to reconcile with new policy so had his tory antagonist disraeli was reminded of that profound and brilliant oracle of 1844 when he had described the root of mischief in ireland as a weak executive an absentee aristocracy and an alien church he wasted little time in trying to explain why the alien church now found in him its champion “nobody listened” he said “at that time it seemed to me that i was pouring water upon sand but it seems now that the water came from a golden goblet” the sentiment may have been expressed he said “with the heedless rhetoric which i suppose is the appanage of all who sit below the gangway but in my historical conscience the sentiment of that speech was right” the prime minister did not escape taunts from those in his own camp who thought themselves betrayed by him upon reform the year before he repaid the taunts by sarcasm he told lord cranborne that there was vigour in his language and no want of vindictiveness what it wanted was finish considering that lord cranborne had written anonymous articles against him before and since they were colleagues—“i do not know whether he wrote them when i was his colleague”—they really ought to have been more polished mr lowe again he described as a remarkable man especially remarkable for his power of spontaneous aversion he hates the working classes of england he hates the roman catholics of ireland he hates the protestants of ireland he hates ministers and until mr gladstone placed his hand upon the ark he seemed almost to hate mr gladstone  after mr gladstone’s first resolution was carried the prime minister acknowledged the change in the relations of the government and the house he and his party had conducted the business of the country though in a minority just as lord john russell between 1846 and 1851 had conducted business for five or six years though in a minority “but being morally supported by a majority as we have been supported by a majority” in this crisis he pursued a peculiar course he advised the queen to dissolve the parliament but at the same time he told her majesty that if she thought the interests of the country would be better served he tendered his resignation the queen did not accept it he said and the ministerial decision was to dissolve in the autumn when the new constituencies would be in order the statement was not clear and mr gladstone sought in vain to discover with precision whether the prime minister had begun by resigning or had presented two alternatives leaving the decision to the queen and did he mean a dissolution on existing registers the answer to these questions was not definite but it did not matter  this episode did not check mr gladstone for a moment in his course in a week after the resolutions were carried he introduced a bill suspending the creation of new interests in the irish church this proof of vigour and resolution rapidly carried the suspensory bill through the commons the lords threw it out by a majority of 95 june 29 if we sometimes smile at the sanguine prediction of the optimist the gloom of his pessimist opponent is more ludicrous “if you overthrow the irish established church” cried the archbishop of dublin “you will put to the irish protestants the choice between apostasy and expatriation and every man among them who has money or position when he sees his church go will leave the country if you do that you will find ireland so difficult to manage that you will have to depend on the gibbet and the sword” the bishop of chester and bishop thirlwall whom mr gladstone described as “one of the most masculine powerful and luminous intellects that have for generations been known among the bishops of england” were deliberately absent from the division the effect of the bill was not impaired perhaps it was even heightened for it convinced the public that its author meant earnest and vigorous business and the air was instantly alive with the thrill of battle for it is undoubted that if the country cares for a thing the resistance to it of the hereditary house seems to add spice and an element of sport     chapter

  i   during the election nov 23 mr gladstone published his chapter of autobiography the history of his journey from the book of 1838 to the resolutions thirty years later170 lord granville told him frankly that he never liked nor quite understood the first book that the description of it in the new “chapter” gave him little pleasure that he had at first a feeling that the less a person in mr gladstone’s position published the better and that unnecessary explanation would only provoke fresh attacks but as he read on these misgivings melted away he thought the description of a certain phase of the history of the english church one of the most eloquent and feeling passages he ever read the reference to the nonconformists was a graceful amend to them for being so passionate an oxonian and churchman the piece of controversy with macaulay rather an exaggeration and not easy to understand the closing pages admirable in short he was all for publication another close friend of mr gladstone’s sir robert phillimore told him nov 29 “i am satisfied that you have done wisely and justly both with reference to the immediate and future influence of your character as a statesman it is exactly what a mere man of the world would not have done his standard would have been the ephemeral opinion of the clubs and not the earnest opinion of the silent but thoughtful persons to whom the moral character of their chief is a matter of real moment and concern” newman wrote to him from the oratory at birmingham “it is most noble and i can congratulate you with greater reason and more hearty satisfaction upon it than i could upon a score of triumphs at the hustings” the man of the world and the man at the club did not hide their disgust but phillimore was right and great hosts of people of the other sort welcomed in this publication a sign of sincerity and simplicity and desire to take the public into that full confidence which makes the ordinary politician tremble as undignified and indecorous  that mr gladstone had rightly divined the state of public feeling about ireland was shown by the result manning put the case in apt words when he wrote to him “i have been much struck by the absence of all serious opposition to your policy and by the extensive and various support given to it in england and scotland it is not so much a change in men’s thoughts but a revelation of what they have been thinking” heart and soul he flung himself into the labours of his canvass the constituency for which he had sat in the expiring parliament was now divided and with mr h r grenfell for a colleague he contested what had become southwest lancashire the breadth the elevation the freshness the power the measure the high selfcommand of these speeches were never surpassed by any of his performances when publicists warn us and rightly warn us that rash expenditure of money extracted from the taxpayer and the ratepayer is the besetting vice and peril of democracy and when some of them in the same breath denounce mr gladstone as a demagogue pandering to the multitude they should read the speech at leigh in which he assailed the system of making things pleasant all round stimulating local cupidity to feed upon the public purse and scattering grants at the solicitation of individuals and classes no minister that ever lived toiled more sedulously in office and out of office to avert this curse of popular government the main staple of his discourse was naturally the irish case and though within the next twenty years he acquired a wider familiarity with detail he never exhibited the large features of that case with more cogent and persuasive mastery he told the story of the transformation of the franchise bill with a combined precision completeness and lightness of hand that made his articles of charge at once extremely interesting and wholly unanswerable in a vein of pleasant mockery on the accusation that he was going to ruin and destroy the constitution he reminded them that within his own recollection it had been wholly ruined and destroyed eight times in 1828 by the repeal of the corporation and test acts in 1829 by admitting roman catholics to parliament in 1832 by reform in 1846 by free trade in 1849 by repeal of the navigation law in 1858 when jews were allowed to sit in parliament in 1866 when the government of lord russell had the incredible audacity to propose a reform bill with the intention of carrying it or falling in the attempt  m74 it was a magnificent campaign but in southwest lancashire the church of england was strong orange prevailed vastly over green and mr gladstone was beaten happily he had in anticipation of the result and by the care of friends already been elected for greenwich171 in the kingdom as a whole he was triumphant the liberal majority was 112 when the gross votes were added up it was calculated that the liberals had a million and a half and the conservatives less than a million172 after a long era of torpor a powerful party thus once more came into being the cause was excellent but more potent than the cause was the sight of a leader with a resolute will an unresting spirit of reform and the genius of political action this ascendency mr gladstone maintained for quarter of a century to come    ii   on the afternoon of the first of december he received at hawarden the communication from windsor “i was standing by him” says mr evelyn ashley “holding his coat on my arm while he in his shirt sleeves was wielding an axe to cut down a tree up came a telegraph messenger he took the telegram opened it and read it then handed it to me speaking only two words ‘very significant’ and at once resumed his work the message merely stated that general grey would arrive that evening from windsor this of course implied that a mandate was coming from the queen charging mr gladstone with the formation of his first government after a few minutes the blows ceased and mr gladstone resting on the handle of his axe looked up and with deep earnestness in his voice and with great intensity in his face exclaimed ‘my mission is to pacify ireland’ he then resumed his task and never said another word till the tree was down”173 general grey reached hawarden the next day bringing with him the letter from the queen       from the queen      december 1st 1868—mr disraeli has tendered his resignation to     the queen the result of the appeal to the country is too evident     to require its being proved by a vote in parliament and the queen     entirely agrees with mr disraeli and his colleagues in thinking     that the most dignified course for them to pursue as also the     best for the public interests was immediate resignation under     these circumstances the queen must ask mr gladstone as the     acknowledged leader of the liberal party to undertake the     formation of a new administration with one or two exceptions the     reasons for which she has desired general grey the bearer of this     letter to explain the queen would impose no restrictions on mr     gladstone as to the arrangement of the various offices in the     manner which he believes to be best for the public service and     she trusts that he will find no difficulty in filling them up or     at least the greater part of them so that the council may be held     before the 13th mr gladstone will understand why the queen would     wish to be spared making any arrangements of this nature for the     next few days after the 13th the queen adds what she said on a     similar occasion two years and a half ago to lord derby that she     will not name any time for seeing mr gladstone who may wish to     have an opportunity of consulting some of his friends before he     sees her but that as soon as he shall have done so and     expresses a desire to see the queen she will be ready to receive     him   m75 one of his first letters after undertaking to form a government was to lord russell to whom he said that he looked forward with hope and confidence to full and frequent communications and to the benefit of his friendship and advice “there remains however a question” he went on “you have an experience and knowledge to which no living statesman can pretend of the benefit to be derived from it i am sure that all with whom i can be likely to act would be deeply sensible would it be too great an invasion of your independence to ask you to consider whether you could afford it as a member of the cabinet without the weight of any other responsibility” lord russell replied in cordial terms but said that the servitude of a cabinet whether with or without a special office was what he did not wish to encounter “what i should have said” he added at a later date dec 28 “if the office of the president of the council or the privy seal had been offered me i do not know at all events i am personally very well satisfied to be free from all responsibility” sir george grey also declined on the ground of years he was within one of the threescore and ten allotted to mortal man lord halifax on whose ability and experience both the queen and mr gladstone set special value declined the irish viceroyalty and stood goodnaturedly aside until 1870 when he joined as privy seal the inclusion in the same cabinet of mr bright who had been the chief apostle of reform with mr lowe its fiercest persecutor startled the country as for lowe lord acton told me that he once informed mr gladstone that lowe had written the review of his financial statements in the periodical of which acton was editor “he told me at grillion’s that i thereby made him chancellor of the exchequer” with bright he had greater difficulties he often described how he wrestled with this admirable man from eleven o’clock until past midnight striving to overcome his repugnance to office the next day bright wrote to him dec 5 “since i left you at midnight i have had no sleep from which you may imagine the mental disturbance i have suffered from our long conversation last night nevertheless i am driven to the conclusion to take the step to which you invite me surrendering my inclination and my judgment to your arguments and to the counsel of some whom i have a right to consider my friends i am deeply grateful to you for the confidence you are willing to place in me and for the many kind words you spoke to me yesterday” in the parched air of official politics the relation of these two towards one another is a peculiar and a refreshing element in the case of lord clarendon some difficulty was intimated from windsor before mr gladstone began his task mr gladstone says in one of his late notes—       clarendon had already held with credit and success for a     lengthened period the seals of the foreign office and his     presumptive title to resume them was beyond dispute he was a man     of free and entertaining and almost jovial conversation in     society and possibly some remark culled from the dinner hour had     been reported to the queen with carelessness or malignity i do     not know much of the interior side of court gossip but i have a     very bad opinion of it and especially on this ground that while     absolutely irresponsible it appears to be uniformly admitted as     infallible in this case it was impossible for me to recede from     my duty and no grave difficulty arose so far as i can recollect     the queen had very little to say in objection and no keen desire     to say it clarendon was the only living british statesman whose     name carried any influence in the councils of europe only     eighteen or twenty months remained to him they were spent in     useful activity my relations with him were as they were     afterwards with granville close constant and harmonious   m76 of this cabinet mr gladstone always spoke as one of the best instruments for government that ever were constructed174 nearly everybody in it was a man of talent character and force and showed high capacity for public business in one or two cases conformably to the old greek saying office showed the man showed that mere cleverness apart from judgment and discretion is only too possible and that good intention only makes failure and incapacity in carrying the intention out so much the more mortifying the achievements of this cabinet as a whole as we shall see are a great chapter in the history of reform and the prudent management of national affairs it forms one of the best vindications of the cabinet system and of the powers of the minister who created guided controlled and inspired it  “and so” manning the close friend of other years now wrote to him “you are at the end men live for but not i believe the end for which you have lived it is strange so to salute you but very pleasant there are many prayers put up among us for you and mine are not wanting” at an earlier stage sympathetic resolutions had been sent to him from nonconformist denominations and in writing to dr allon who forwarded them mr gladstone said “i thank you for all the kind words contained in your letter but most of all for the assurance not the first i am happy to say which has reached me that many prayers are offered on my behalf i feel myself by the side of this arduous undertaking a small creature but where the almighty sends us duties he also sends the strength needful to perform them” to mr arthur gordon the son of lord aberdeen he wrote jan 29 1869—       as regards my own personal position all its interior relations     are up to this time entirely satisfactory i myself at the period     of the aberdeen administration was as far as the world in general     could possibly be from either expecting or desiring it i thought     at that time that when lord russell’s career should end the duke     of newcastle would be the proper person to be at the head of the     government but during the government of lord palmerston and long     before his health broke down i had altered this opinion for i     thought i saw an alteration both in his tone of opinion and in     his vigour of administration and breadth of view since that time     i have seen no alternative but that which has now come about     although i am sensible that it is a very indifferent one   on december 29 he enters in his diary “this birthday opens my sixtieth year i descend the hill of life it would be a truer figure to say i ascend a steepening path with a burden ever gathering weight the almighty seems to sustain and spare me for some purpose of his own deeply unworthy as i know myself to be glory be to his name” in the closing hours of the year he enters—       this month of december has been notable in my life as follows     dec 1809—born 1827—left eton 1831—classes at oxford     1832—elected to parliament 1838—work on church and state     published 1834—took office as lord of the treasury     1845—secretary of state 1852—chancellor of exchequer     1868—first lord rather a frivolous enumeration yet it would not     be so if the love of symmetry were carried with a     wellproportioned earnestness and firmness into the higher parts     of life i feel like a man with a burden under which he must fall     and be crushed if he looks to the right or left or fails from any     cause to concentrate mind and muscle upon his progress step by     step this absorption this excess this constant ἄγαν is the     fault of political life with its insatiable demands which do not     leave the smallest stock of moral energy unexhausted and available     for other purposes swimming for his life a man does not see     much of the country through which the river winds and i probably     know little of these years through which i busily work and     live it has been a special joy of this december that our son     stephen is given to the church “whose shoe latchet i am not     worthy to unloose”      book vi 18691874     chapter i religious equality 1869       in the removal of this establishment i see the discharge of a debt     of civil justice the disappearance of a national almost a     worldwide reproach a condition indispensable to the success of     every effort to secure the peace and contentment of that country     finally relief to a devoted clergy from a false position cramped     and beset by hopeless prejudice and the opening of a freer career     to their sacred ministry—gladstone    i   anybody could pulverise the irish church in argument and to show that it ought to be disestablished and disendowed was the easiest thing in the world but as often happens what it was easy to show ought to be done was extremely hard to do here mr gladstone was in his great element it was true to say that “never were the wheels of legislative machinery set in motion under conditions of peace and order and constitutional regularity to deal with a question greater or more profound” than when the historic protestant church in ireland was severed from its sister church in england and from its ancient connection with the state the case had been fully examined in parliament after examination and decision there it was discussed and decided in the constituencies of the united kingdom even then many held that the operation was too gigantic in its bearings too complex in the mass of its detail to be practicable never was our political system more severely tested and never did it achieve a completer victory every great organ of the national constitution came into active play the sovereign performed a high and useful duty the lords fought hard but yielded before the strain reached a point of danger the prelates in the midst of anger and perturbation were forced round to statesmanship the commons stood firm and unbroken the law when at length it became law effected the national purpose with extraordinary thoroughness and precision and the enterprise was inspired guided propelled perfected and made possible from its inception to its close by the resource temper and incomparable legislative skill of mr gladstone that the removal of the giant abuse of protestant establishment in ireland made a deeper mark on national wellbeing than other of his legislative exploits we can hardly think but—quite apart from the policy of the act as to which there can now be scarcely two opinions—as a monument of difficulties surmounted prejudices and violent or sullen heats overcome rights and interests adjusted i know not where in the records of our legislation to find its master  m77 with characteristic hopefulness and simplicity mr gladstone tried to induce archbishop trench and others of the irish hierarchy to come to terms without raising the cry of no surrender they declined all approaches if gladstone they said were able to announce in the house of commons a concordat with the irish clergy it would ruin them both with the laity of the irish establishment and with the english conservatives who had fought for them at the election and might well be expected as a piece of party business if for no better reasons to fight on for them in the house of lords who could tell that the gladstone majority would hold together though “no surrender” might be a bad cry it was even now at the eleventh hour possible that “no popery” would be a good one in short they argued this was one of the cases where terms could only be settled on the field of battle there were moderates the most eminent being bishop magee of peterborough who had an interview with mr gladstone at this stage but nothing came of it one irish clergyman only stopford the archdeacon of meath a moderate who disliked the policy but wished to make the best of the inevitable gave mr gladstone the benefit of his experience and ability when the work was done mr gladstone wrote to the archdeacon more than once expressing his sense of the advantage derived from his “thorough mastery of the subject and enlightened view of the political situation” he often spoke of stopford’s “knowledge terseness discrimination and just judgment”  meanwhile his own course was clear he did not lose a day—       dec 13 1868—saw the queen at one and stated the case of the     irish church it was graciously received 24—at night went to     work on draft of irish church measure feeling the impulse     25—christmas day worked much on irish church abbozzo finished     it at night 26—revised the irish church draft and sent it to be     copied with notes   the general situation he described to bishop hinds on the last day of the year—       we cannot wait for the church of ireland to make up her mind we     are bound nay compelled to make up ours every day of the     existence of this government is now devoted to putting forward by     some step of inquiry or deliberation the great duty we have     undertaken our principles are already laid in the resolutions of     the late house of commons but in the mode of applying them much     may depend on the attitude of resistance or cooperation assumed     by the irish church it is idle for the leading irish churchmen to     think “we will wait and see what they offer and then ask so much     more” our mode of warfare cannot but be influenced by the troops     we lead our three corps d’armée i may almost say have been     scotch presbyterians english and welsh nonconformists and irish     roman catholics we are very strong in our minority of clerical     and lay churchmen but it is the strength of weight not of     numbers the english clergy as a body have done their worst     against us and have hit us hard as i know personally in the     counties yet we represent the national force tested by a     majority of considerably over a hundred voices it is hazardous in     these times to tamper with such a force   the preparation of the bill went rapidly forward—       hawarden jan 13 1869—wrote out a paper on the plan of the     measure respecting the irish church intended perhaps for the     queen worked on homer we felled a lime 14—we felled another     tree worked on homer but not much for in the evening came the     spencers from dublin also archdeacon stopford and i had much     irish conversation with them 15—we felled an ash three hours     conversation with the viceroy and the archdeacon i went over much     of the roughest ground of the intended measure the archdeacon     able and helpful also conversation with the viceroy who went     before 7 worked on homer at night 19—one hour on homer with sir     j acton whist in evening 20—further and long conversations on     the irish church question and its various branches with granville     the attorneygeneral for ireland and in the evening with dean     howson also with sir j acton 21—wrote a brief abstract of the     intended bill woodcutting 23—saw the queen at osborne on the     irish church especially and gave hm my paper with explanation     which appeared to be well taken she was altogether at ease we     dined with hm afterwards 24—saw her majesty who spoke very     kindly about lord clarendon mr bright mr lowe the spanish     crown prince leopold mr mozley and so forth but not a word on     the irish church feb 4—a letter from hm today showed much     disturbance which i tried to soothe   in february lord granville thought that it might do good if the queen were to see bishop magee mr gladstone said to him in reply feb 7 ’69—       the case is peculiar and not free from difficulty on the whole i     think it would be wrong to place any limit upon the queen’s     communications to the bishop of peterborough except this that     they would doubtless be made by hm to him for himself only and     that no part of them would go beyond him to any person whatever   m78 on feb 12 the queen wrote to mr gladstone from osborne—       the queen has seen the bishop of peterborough according to the     suggestion made by lord granville with the sanction of mr     gladstone and has communicated to him in the strictest confidence     the correspondence which had passed between herself and mr     gladstone on the subject of the irish church she now sends mr     gladstone a copy of the remarks made by the bishop on the papers     which she placed in his hands for perusal and would earnestly     entreat mr gladstone’s careful and dispassionate consideration of     what he says she would point especially to the suggestion which     the bishop throws out of the intervention of the bench of english     bishops the country would feel that any negotiation conducted     under the direction of the archbishop of canterbury would be     perfectly safe and from the concessions which the bishop of     peterborough expresses his own readiness to make the queen is     sanguine in her hope that such negotiations would result in a     settlement of the question on conditions which would entirely     redeem the pledges of the government and be satisfactory to the     country the queen must therefore strongly deprecate the hasty     introduction of the measure which would serve only to commit the     government to proposals from which they could not afterwards     recede while it is certain from what the bishop says that they     would not be accepted on the other side and thus an acrimonious     contest would be begun which however it ended would make any     satisfactory settlement of the question impossible   he replied on the following day—       feb 13—first the bishop suggests that the endowments posterior     to the reformation should be given to the church and those     preceding it to the roman catholics it would be more than idle     and less than honest were mr gladstone to withhold from your     majesty his conviction that no negotiation founded on such a basis     as this could be entertained or if entertained could lead to     any satisfactory result neither could mr gladstone persuade the     cabinet to adopt it nor could the cabinet persuade the house of     commons nor could cabinet and house of commons united persuade     the nation to acquiesce and the very attempt would not only     prolong and embitter controversy but would weaken authority in     this country for the thing contemplated is the very thing that     the parliament was elected not to do      osborne feb 14—the queen thanks mr gladstone for his long     letter and is much gratified and relieved by the conciliatory     spirit expressed throughout his explanations on this most     difficult and important question the queen thinks it would indeed     be most desirable for him to see the archbishop of canterbury—and     she is quite ready to write to the archbishop to inform him of her     wish and of mr gladstone’s readiness to accede to it should he     wish it   “my impression is” mr gladstone wrote to lord granville feb 14 “that we should make a great mistake if we were to yield on the point of time it is not time that is wanted we have plenty of time to deal with the bishop of peterborough’s points so far as they can be dealt with at all sir r palmer has been here today with overtures from persons of importance unnamed i think probably the archbishop of canterbury and others175 i do not doubt that on the other side they want time for their suggestions are crude”  m79 on the following day feb 15 the queen wrote to the archbishop telling him that she had seen mr gladstone “who shows the most conciliatory disposition” and who at once assured her “of his readiness—indeed his anxiety—to meet the archbishop and to communicate freely with him” the correspondence between the queen and the archbishop has already been made known and most of that between the archbishop and mr gladstone and i need not here reproduce it for in fact at this first stage nothing particular came of it176 “the great mistake as it seems to me” mr gladstone writes to archdeacon stopford feb 8 “made by the irish bishops and others is this they seem to think that our friends are at the mercy of our adversaries whereas our adversaries are really at the mercy of our friends and it is to these latter that the government especially in the absence of other support must look” meanwhile the bill had made its way through the cabinet—       feb 8—cabinet on the heads of irish church bill 9—cabinet     we completed the heads of the irish church measure to my great     satisfaction 19—at lambeth 121½ explaining to the archbishop     22—conclave on irish church 34½ and 5½734 after twenty     hours’ work we finished the bill for this stage    ii   on march 1 mr gladstone brought his plan before a house of commons eager for its task triumphant in its strength out of doors and confident that its leader would justify the challenge with which for so many months the country had been ringing the details are no longer of concern and only broader aspects survive a revolutionary change was made by the complete and definite severance of the protestant episcopal church in ireland alike from the established church of england and from the government of the united kingdom a far more complex and delicate task was the winding up of a great temporal estate the adjustment of many individual and corporate interests and the distribution of some sixteen millions of property among persons and purposes to be determined by the wisdom of a parliament where rival claims were defended by zealous and powerful champions influenced by the strongest motives sacred and profane of party property and church it was necessary to deal with the sums troublesome though not considerable allotted to the presbyterians and to the catholic seminary at maynooth machinery was constructed for the incorporation of a body to represent the emancipated church and to hold property for any of its uses and purposes finally the residue of the sixteen millions after all the just demands upon it had been satisfied computed at something between seven and eight millions was appropriated in the words of the preamble “not for the maintenance of any church or clergy nor for the teaching of religion but mainly for the relief of unavoidable calamity and suffering” not touched by the poor law  the speech in which this arduous scheme was explained to parliament was regarded as mr gladstone’s highest example of lucid and succinct unfolding of complicated matter mr disraeli said there was not a single word wasted so skilfully were the facts marshalled that every single hearer believed himself thoroughly to comprehend the eternal principles of the commutation of titherentcharge and the difference in the justice due to a transitory and a permanent curate manning said that the only two legislative acts in our history that approached it in importance for ireland were the repeal of the penal laws and the act of union however this may be it is hardly an excess to say that since pitt the author of the act of union the author of the church act was the only statesman in the roll of the century capable at once of framing such a statute and expounding it with the same lofty and commanding power177  m80 in a fugitive note mr gladstone named one or two of the speakers on the second reading “ball elaborate and impressive answered with great power by irish attorneygeneral bright very eloquent and striking young george hamilton a first speech of great talent admirably delivered hardy an uncompromising defence of laws and institutions as they are with a severe picture of the character and civil conduct of the irish population” mr disraeli’s speech was even more artificial than usual it was mr hardy and dr ball who gave cogent and strenuous expression to the argument and passion of the church case when the division came called by mr gladstone “notable and historic” march 24 the majority in a crowded house was 118178 “our division this morning” mr gladstone wrote to lord granville “even exceeded expectations and will powerfully propel the bill” the size of this majority deserves the reader’s attention for it marked the opening of a new parliamentary era in 1841 peel had turned out the whigs by a majority of 91 lord john russell was displaced in 1852 by 9 the derby government was thrown out in december 1852 by 19 the same government was again thrown out seven years later by 13 palmerston was beaten in 1857 by 14 and the next year by 19 in 1864 palmerston’s majority on the danish question was only 18 the second reading of the franchise bill of 1866 was only carried by 5 and ministers were afterwards beaten upon it by 11 with mr gladstone’s accession the ruling majority for a long time stood at its highest both in size and stability  with invincible optimism mr gladstone believed that he would now have “material communications from the heads of the irish church” but letters from lord spencer at dublin castle informed him that on the contrary they were angrier after they knew what the majority meant than they were before at the diocesan conferences throughout ireland the bill was denounced as highly offensive to almighty god and the greatest national sin ever committed the archdeacon of ossory told churchmen to trust to god and keep their powder dry though he afterwards explained that he did not allude to carnal weapons the cabinet was called a cabinet of brigands and protestant pastors were urged to see to it that before they gave up their churches to an apostate system a barrel of gunpowder and a box of matches should blow the cherished fabrics to the winds of heaven  even mr disraeli’s astuteness was at fault the archbishop of canterbury perceived from his conversation that he was bent on setting the liberals by the ears that he looked for speeches such as would betray utter dissension amid professed agreement that he had good hopes of shattering the enemy and “perhaps of playing over again the game that had destroyed lord russell’s reform bill of 1866” the resounding majority on the second reading he told the archbishop was expected it created no enthusiasm it was a mechanical majority179  the bill swept through the stages of committee without alteration of substance and with extraordinary celerity due not merely to the “brute majority” nor to the confidence that all was sure to be undone in another place but to the peculiar powers developed by the minister from the speech in which he unfolded his plan down to the last amendment on report he showed a mastery alike of himself and of his project and of the business from day to day in hand that routed opposition and gave new animation and ardour to the confidence of his friends for six or seven hours a day he astonished the house by his power of attention unrelaxed yet without strain by his double grasp of leading principle and intricate detail by his equal command of legal and historic controversy and of all the actuarial niceties and puzzles of commutation “in some other qualities of parliamentary statesmanship” says one acute observer of that time “as an orator a debater and a tactician he has rivals but in the powers of embodying principles in legislative form and preserving unity of purpose through a multiplicity of confusing minutiae he has neither equal nor second among living statesmen”180 the truth could not be better summed up he carried the whole of his party with him and the average majority in divisions on the clauses was 113 of one dangerous corner he says—       may 6—h of c working irish church bill spoke largely on     maynooth proposal to compensate maynooth out of the funds of the     irish church the final division on the pinching point with a     majority of 107 was the most creditable i think i have ever     known   by a majority of 114 the bill was read a third time on the last day of may    iii   m81 the contest was now removed from the constituencies and their representatives in parliament to the citadel of privilege the issue was no longer single and the struggle for religious equality in ireland was henceforth merged before the public eye in a conflict for the supremacy of the commons in england perhaps i should not have spoken of religious equality for in fact the establishment was known to be doomed and the fight turned upon the amount of property with which the free church was to go forth to face its new fortunes “i should urge the house of lords” wrote the archbishop of canterbury to mr gladstone june 3 “to give all its attention to saving as large an endowment as possible”  as at the first stage the queen had moved for conciliatory courses so now she again desired archbishop tait to communicate with the prime minister to mr gladstone himself she wrote from balmoral june 3 “the queen thanks mr gladstone for his kind letter she has invariably found him most ready to enter into her views and to understand her feelings” the first question was whether the lords should reject the bill on the second reading—       it is eminently desirable mr gladstone wrote to the archbishop     june 4 that the bill should be read a second time but if i     compare two methods both inexpedient one that of rejection on     the second reading the other that of a second reading followed by     amendments inconsistent with the principle i know no argument in     favour of the latter except what relates to the very important     question of the position and true interest of the house of lords     itself   at the same time he promised the archbishop that any views of his upon amendments would have the most careful attention of himself and his colleagues and “they would be entertained in a spirit not of jealousy but of freedom with every desire to bring them into such a shape that they may be in furtherance and not in derogation of the main design of the bill”  general grey the queen’s secretary told mr gladstone that she had communicated with the archbishop “having heard that violent counsels were likely to prevail and that in spite of their leaders the opposition in the house of lords was likely to try and throw out the measure on the second reading” her own feeling was expressed in general grey’s letter to the archbishop of the same date of which a copy was sent to the prime minister—       mr gladstone is not ignorant indeed the queen has never     concealed her feeling on the subject how deeply her majesty     deplores the necessity under which he conceived himself to lie     of raising the question as he has done or of the apprehensions of     which she cannot divest herself as to the possible consequences     of the measure which he has introduced these apprehensions her     majesty is bound to say still exist in full force but     considering the circumstances under which the measure has come to     the house of lords the queen cannot regard without the greatest     alarm the probable effect of its absolute rejection in that house     carried as it has been by an overwhelming and steady majority     through a house of commons chosen expressly to speak the feeling     of the country on the question there seems no reason to believe     that any fresh appeal to the people would lead to a different     result the rejection of the bill therefore on the second     reading would only serve to bring the two houses into collision     and to prolong a dangerous agitation on the subject   mr gladstone replied—       june 5—from such information as has indirectly reached mr     gladstone he fears that the leaders of the majority in the house     of lords will undoubtedly oppose the second reading of the irish     church bill of which lord harrowby is to propose the rejection     he understands that lord salisbury as well as lord carnarvon     decidedly but in vain objected to this course at the meeting     held today at the duke of marlborough’s very few of the bishops     were present lord derby it is said supported the resolution     although a division must now be regarded as certain and as very     formidable all hope need not be abandoned that your majesty’s     wise counsels through the archbishop of canterbury and the     sagacity of the peers themselves with reference to the security     and stability of their position in the legislature may avail to     frustrate an unwise resolution   “how much more effectually” mr gladstone wrote to hawarden “could the queen assist in the settlement of this question were she not six hundred miles off” as it was she took a step from which mr gladstone hoped for “most important consequences” in writing direct to lord derby dwelling on the danger to the lords of a collision with the commons in a record of these proceedings prepared for mr gladstone august 4 ’69 lord granville writes—       before the second reading of the irish church bill in the house of     lords i was asked by the archbishop of york to meet him and the     archbishop of canterbury they said it was impossible for them to     vote for the second reading in any case but before they decided     to abstain from voting against it they wished to know how far the     government would act in a conciliatory spirit i made to them the     same declaration that i afterwards made in the house and after     seeing you i had another interview with the archbishop of     canterbury i told his grace that it was impossible for the     government to suggest amendments against themselves but i gave a     hint of the direction in which such amendments might be framed     and without mentioning that the suggestion came from you i said     that if his grace would tell dr ball that he only wished to     propose amendments which it would be possible for the government     to accept that learned gentleman would know better than others     how it could be done the archbishop however seems chiefly to     have made use of dr ball to supply him with arguments against the     government   the result was doubtful to the very end it was three o’clock in the morning june 19 before the close of a fine debate—fine not merely from the eloquence of the speakers and cogency of argument on either side but because there was a deep and real issue and because the practical conclusion was not foregone it was the fullest house assembled in living memory three hundred and twentyfive peers voted the two english archbishops did not vote and thirlwall was the only prelate who supported the second reading it was carried by a majority of 33 in 1857 lord derby’s vote of censure on palmerston for the china war was defeated by 36 and these two were the only cases in which the conservatives had been beaten in the lords for twenty years thirtysix conservative peers including lord salisbury voted away from their party in favour of the second reading    iv   m82 for the moment ministers breathed freely but the bill was soon in the trough of the sea the archbishop wrote to the queen that they had decided if they could not get three million pounds to float the new church upon they would take their chance of what might happen by postponing the bill until next year asked by the queen what could be done july 10 lord granville being at windsor answered that the cabinet would not make up their mind until they knew how far the lords would go in resistance but he thought it right to tell her that there was no chance of ministers agreeing to postpone the bill for another year the day after this conversation the queen wrote again to the archbishop asking him seriously to reflect in case the concessions of the government should not go quite so far as he might himself wish whether the postponement of the settlement for another year would not be likely to result rather in worse than in better terms for the church she trusted that he would himself consider and endeavour to induce others to consider any concessions offered by the house of commons in the most conciliatory spirit rather than to try and get rid of the bill “the amendments” said mr gladstone “seem to mean war to the knife”  after the second reading a tory lady of high station told lord clarendon and mr delane that in her opinion a friendly communication might have great influence on lord salisbury’s course       i therefore wrote to him lord granville says in the memorandum     already referred to stating why on public and personal grounds     it was desirable that he should meet you i said that although it     would be difficult for us to initiate suggestions yet from your     personal regard for him such a conversation would advance matters     he consented stating that he was in communication as to     amendments with lord cairns and the archbishop he was extremely     desirous that no one should know of the interview you were of     opinion that the interview had done good and i wrote to ask lord     salisbury whether he would like me to put dots on some of your     i’s he declined and considered the interview had been     unsatisfactory but gave me an assurance of his desire to avoid a     conflict on the 4th of july i wrote again suggesting a     compromise on lord carnarvon’s clause he declined that clause     being the one thing they cared about he ended by telling me his     growing impression was that there would be no church bill this     session   the general result of the operations of the lords was to leave disestablishment complete and the legal framework of the bill undisturbed disendowment on the other hand was reduced to a shadow an additional sum of between three and four millions was taken for the church and the general upshot was out of a property of sixteen millions to make over thirteen or fourteen millions to an ecclesiastical body wholly exempt from state control this mr gladstone told the queen the house of commons would never accept and the first effect of persistence in such a course would be a stronger move against the episcopal seats in the house of lords than had been seen for more than two hundred years he ridiculed as it deserved the contention that the nation had not passed judgment on the question of disendowment and he insisted that the government could not go further than three quarters of a million towards meeting the extravagant claims of the lords confessing his disappointment at the conduct of the episcopal body even including the archbishop he found a certain consolation in reflecting that equally on the great occasions of 1829 and 1831 though ’the mild and wise archbishop howley was its leader’ that body failed either to meet the desires of the country or to act upon a farsighted view of the exigencies of the church one point obstinately contested was the plan for the future application of the surplus a majority of the lords insisted on casting out the words of the preamble providing that the residue should not be applied for purposes of religion and substituting in one shape or another the principle of concurrent endowment so hostile as mr gladstone judged it to the peace of ireland and so irreconcilable with public feeling in england and scotland  on july 12 the bill came back to the commons the tension had hardly yet begun to tell upon him but mr gladstone enters on these days—       july 11—formidable accounts from and through windsor 12—the     time grows more and more anxious 15—this day i received from a     roman catholic bishop the assurance that he offered mass and that     many pray for me and from mr spurgeon as often from others an     assurance of the prayers of the nonconformists i think in these     and other prayers lies the secret of the strength of body which     has been given me in unusual measure during this very trying year   this was the day on which amid the ardent cheers of his party he arose to announce to the house the views of the government he was in no compromising mood in a short speech he went through the amendments made by men so out of touch with the feeling of the country that they might have been “living in a balloon” one by one he moved the rejection of all amendments that involved the principle of concurrent endowment the disposal of the surplus or the postponement of the date of disestablishment he agreed however to give a lump sum of half a million in lieu of private benefactions to readjust the commutation terms and make other alterations involving a further gift of £280000 to the church when the commons concluded the consideration of the lords’ amendments july 16 mr gladstone observed three things first that the sentiment against concurrent endowment in any form was overwhelming second that not only was no disposition shown to make new concessions but concessions actually made were sorely grudged and third that the tories were eager to postpone the destination of the residuary property    v   m83 on july 16 the bill restored substantially to its first shape was again back on the table of the lords and shipwreck seemed for five days to be inevitable on july 20 at eleven o’clock by a majority of 175 to 93 the lords once more excluded from the preamble the words that the commons had placed and replaced there in order to declare the policy of parliament on matters ecclesiastical in ireland this involved a meaning which mr gladstone declared that no power on earth could induce the commons to accept the crisis was of unsurpassed anxiety for the prime minister he has fortunately left his own record of its phases181—       saturday july 17—on the 16th of july the amendments made by     the lords in the irish church bill had been completely disposed of     by the house of commons the last division taken on the disposal     of the residue had chiefly through mere lazy absences reduced     the majority for the government to 72 this relative weakness     offered a temptation to the opposition to make play upon the     point the cabinet met the next forenoon we felt on the one hand     that it might be difficult to stake the bill on the clause for the     disposal of the residue supposing that to be the single remaining     point of difference but that the postponement of this question     would be a great moral and political evil and that any concession     made by us had far better be one that would be of some value to     the disestablished church      by desire of the cabinet i went to windsor in the afternoon and     represented to hm what it was in our power to do namely     although we had done all we could do upon the merits yet for the     sake of peace and of the house of lords we were willing a     to make some one further pecuniary concession to the church of     sensible though not very large amount b to make a further     concession as to curates slight in itself c to amend the     residue clause so as to give to parliament the future control and     to be content with simply declaring the principle on which the     property should be distributed the queen while considering that     she could not be a party to this or that particular scheme agreed     that it might be proper to make a representation to the archbishop     to the general effect that the views of the government at this     crisis of the measure were such as deserved to be weighed and to     promote confidential communication between us she intimated her     intention to employ the dean of windsor as a medium of     communication between herself and the archbishop and wished me to     explain particulars fully to him i went to the deanery and not     finding the dean had written as much as here follows on a scrap     of paper when he came in      the object of this paper was to induce the archbishop to     discountenance any plan for pressing the postponement of the     provisions respecting the residue and to deal with us in     preference respecting any practicable concession to the church     when the dean came in i explained this further recited the     purport of my interview with the queen and on his asking me     confidentially for his own information i let him know that the     further pecuniary concession we were prepared to recommend would     be some £170000 or £180000      sunday july 18—in the afternoon lord granville called on me     and brought me a confidential memorandum containing an overture     which mr disraeli had placed in the hands of lord bessborough for     communication to us memorandum not recoverable he had     represented the terms as those which he had with much difficulty     induced lord cairns to consent to while the contention as to the     residue was abandoned and pecuniary concessions alone were     sought the demand amounted according to our computation to     between £900000 and £1000000 this it was evident was     utterly inadmissible i saw no possibility of approach to it and     considered that a further quarter of a million or thereabouts was     all that the house of commons could be expected or asked further     to concede on the same afternoon lord granville falling in with     mr goschen asked him what he thought the very most that could be     had—would it be £500000 goschen answered £300000 and with this     glyn agreed mr disraeli desired an answer before three on     monday      monday july 19—those members of the government who had acted     as a sort of committee in the irish church question met in the     afternoon we were all agreed in opinion that the disraeli     overture must be rejected though without closing the door and a     reply was prepared in this sense which lord granville undertook     to send draft in the above sense that no sum approaching     £1000000 could be entertained      meantime the archbishop had arrived in downing street in     pursuance of the arrangements of saturday and a paper was either     now drawn or sanctioned by my colleagues i do not remember     which in order to form the basis of my communication to the     archbishop i returned from my interview and reported as i     afterwards did to the dean of windsor that his tone was friendly     and that he appeared well disposed to the sort of arrangement i     had sketched      tuesday july 20—the archbishop who had communicated with lord     cairns in the interval came to me early today and brought a     memorandum as a basis of agreement which to my surprise     demanded higher terms than those of mr disraeli182 i told the     archbishop the terms in which we had already expressed ourselves     to mr disraeli meantime an answer had come from mr disraeli     stating that he could not do more then followed the meeting of     the opposition peers at the duke of marlborough’s      on the meeting of the houses a few of us considered what course     was to be taken if the lords should again cast out of the preamble     the words which precluded concurrent endowment and it was agreed     to stay the proceedings for the time and consider among ourselves     what further to do lord granville has a pencil note on the     margin “the first order i received was to throw up the bill to     which i answered that i could not do more than adjourn the     debate” lord granville made this announcement accordingly after     the lords had upon a hot debate and by a large majority again     excluded our words from the preamble 173 95 this had been     after a speech from lord cairns in which he announced his     intention of moving other amendments which he detailed and which     were in general conformable to the proposals already made to us     the first disposition of several of us this evening myself     included was to regard the proceeding of the opposition as now     complete since the whole had been announced the first stroke     struck and the command shown of a force of peers amply sufficient     to do the rest183  the idea did not however include an     absolute abandonment of the bill but only the suspension of our     responsibility for it leaving the opposition to work their own     will and with the intention when this had been done of     considering the matter further      wednesday july 21—the cabinet met at 11 and i went to it in     the mind of last night we discussed however at great length all     possible methods of proceeding that occurred to us the result was     stated in a letter of mine to the queen of which i annex a copy     see appendix he enumerates the various courses considered     and states that the course adopted was to go through the endowment     amendments and if they were carried adversely then to drop their     responsibility      most of the cabinet were desirous to go on longer others myself     included objected to proceeding to the end of the bill or     undertaking to remit the bill again to the house of commons as of     our own motion it occurred to me however that we might proceed     as far as to the end of the many amendments about the middle of     the bill and this appeared to meet the views of all even of     those who would have preferred doing more or less      thursday july 22—i was laid up today and the transactions     were carried on by lord granville in communication with me from     time to time at my house first he brought me a note he had     received from lord cairns   m84 this dated july 22 was to the effect that lord cairns had no right and no desire to ask for any information as to the course proposed that night but that if the statements as to the intention of the government to proceed with the consideration of the amendments were correct and if lord granville thought any advantage likely to result from it lord cairns would be ready “as you know i have throughout been to confer upon a mode by which without sacrifice of principle or dignity upon either side the remaining points of difference might be arranged” the proceedings of this critical day are narrated by lord granville in a memorandum to mr gladstone dated august 4—       after seeing you i met lord cairns at the colonial office he     offered me terms184  i asked him whether in his opinion     he the archbishop and i could carry anything we agreed upon he     said “yes certainly” after seeing you i met lord cairns a     second time in his room at the house of lords i asked as a     preliminary to giving any opinion on his amendments how he     proposed to deal with the preamble he said “to leave it as     amended by the lords” i then proposed the words which were     afterwards adopted in the 68th clause he was at first taken     aback but admitted that he had personally no objection to them     he asked what was the opposition to be feared i suggested some     from lord grey he believed this to be certain but immaterial i     objected in toto to lord salisbury’s clause or its substitute     he was unwilling to yield chiefly on lord salisbury’s account     but finally consented we agreed upon the commutation clause if     the 7 and the 5 per cent were lumped together on the curates     clause we could come to no agreement he proposed to see lord     salisbury and the archbishop and to meet again at four at the     colonial office he spoke with fairness as to the difficulty of     his position and the risk he ran with his own party i again saw     you and asked the irish attorneygeneral to be present at the last     interview i stated to him in lord cairns’s presence how far we     agreed and expressed my regret that on the last point—the     curates—our difference was irreconcilable lord cairns said he     hoped not and proceeded to argue strongly in favour of his     proposal he at last however at 430 compromised the matter by     accepting five years instead of one i shook his hand which was     trembling with nervousness we discussed the form of announcing     the arrangement to the house we at once agreed it was better to     tell the whole truth and soon settled that it would be better for     its success that he should announce the details i was afterwards     apprehensive that this latter arrangement might be disadvantageous     to us but nothing could be better or fairer than his statement i     cannot finish this statement which i believe is accurate without     expressing my admiration at the firmness and conciliation which     you displayed in directing me in all these negotiations   “the news was brought to me on my sofa” mr gladstone says “and between five and six i was enabled to telegraph to the queen my telegram was followed up by a letter at 7 pm which announced that the arrangement had been accepted by the house of lords and that a general satisfaction prevailed” to the queen he wrote july 22—       mr gladstone is at a loss to account for the great change in the     tone and views of the opposition since sunday and monday and even     tuesday last but on this topic it is needless to enter as to the     principal matters the basis of the arrangement on the side of the     government is much the same as was intended when mr gladstone had     the honour of an audience at windsor on saturday but various     minor concessions have been added mr gladstone does not doubt     that if the majority of the house of lords should accede to the     advice of lord cairns the government will be able to induce the     house of commons to agree on the conditions proposed mr     gladstone would in vain strive to express to your majesty the     relief thankfulness and satisfaction with which he contemplates     not only the probable passing of what many believe to be a     beneficent and necessary measure but the undoubted and signal     blessing of an escape from a formidable constitutional conflict     the skill patience assiduity and sagacity of lord granville in     the work of today demand from mr gladstone the tribute of his     warm admiration   on reviewing this whole transaction and doing full justice to the attitude both of the queen and the archbishop the reader will be inclined to agree with old lord halifax “i think we owe a good turn to cairns without whose decision on thursday i hardly think that the settlement could have been effected indeed derby’s conduct proves what difficulty there would have been if cairns had not taken upon himself the responsibility of acting as he did”  among interesting letters was one from manning july 24 “my joy over the event is not only as a catholic though that must be as it ought to be my highest motive but as an englishman to whom as i remember your once saying the old english monarchy is dear next after the catholic church but at this time i will only add that i may wish you joy on personal reasons i could hardly have hoped that you could so have framed mastered and carried through the bill from first to last so complete so unchanged in identity of principle and detail and let me add with such unwearying and sustained selfcontrol and forbearance”  the diary gives us a further glimpse of these agitating days—       july 20—conclave of colleagues on irish church proceedings an     anxious day a sad evening 21—cabinet 11214 stiff but good     22—i was obliged to take to my sofa and spent the day so in     continual interviews with granville glyn west     sullivan—especially the first—on the details and particulars of     the negotiations respecting the irish church bill the favourable     issue left me almost unmanned in the reaction from a sharp and     stern tension of mind 23—my attack did not lessen dr clark     came in the morning and made me up for the house whither i went     25 pm to propose concurrence in the lords’ amendments up to     the moment i felt very weak but this all vanished when i spoke     and while the debate lasted then i went back to bed 25—weak     still i presumed over much in walking a little and fell back at     night to my lowest point   sir robert phillimore records—       july 21—found gladstone at breakfast calm pale but without a     doubt as to the course which the government must pursue viz to     maintain upon every important point the bill as sent back by the     commons probably an autumn session a bill sternly repeated by     the commons too probably without the clauses favourable to the     irish church 23—nothing talked or written of but the political     marvel of yesterday gladstone in a speech universally praised     proposed to the house of commons the bill as now modified and it     passed with much harmony broken by an orange member gladstone     very unwell and ought to have been in bed when he made his     speech 24—gladstone still very weak but in a state of calm     happiness at the unexpected turn which the irish bill had taken     does not now know the origin or history of the sudden resolution     on the part of the leaders of the opposition i am satisfied that     disraeli was alarmed and thoroughly frightened at the state of the     house of commons and the country that cairns was determined to     regain what he had practically lost or was losing the leadership     of the lords and that many of his party were frightened at the     madness and folly of tuesday night considered after a day’s     reflection above all there was a wellgrounded alarm on the     part of cairns and his immediate supporters in the lords that     their order was in imminent danger bluster disappeared and a     retreat as decent as well could be expected was made from a     situation known to be untenable they had never expected that     gladstone would drop the bill 25—much conversation with     gladstone who is still very weak he wrote to the archbishop of     dublin to say in effect that as a private churchman he would be     glad to assist in any way the archbishop could point out in the     organising of the voluntary church in ireland   sir thomas acland writes august 3 1869—       i stayed at house of commons perforce till about 130 or 2 and     then walked away with gladstone through the park it is beautiful     to see his intense enjoyment of the cool fresh air the trees the     sky the gleaming of light on the water all that is refreshing in     contrast to the din of politics   a month later the archbishop of canterbury found mr gladstone at lord granville’s at walmer castle—       reached walmer castle about 630 found gladstone lying in     blankets on the ramparts eating his dinner looking still very     ill he joined us at night full of intelligence his fierce     vigour all the better for being a little tempered much     interesting conversation about the state of the church and     morality in wales also about leading ecclesiastics i gather that     he will certainly nominate temple for a bishopric185     chapter ii first chapter of an agrarian revolution 1870       the irish land act of 1870 in its consequences was certainly one     of the most important measures of the nineteenth century—lecky    i   in the beginning of 1870 one of mr gladstone’s colleagues wrote of him to another “i fear that he is steering straight upon the rocks” so it might well seem to any who knew the unplumbed depths on which he had to shape his voyage irish history has been said to resemble that of spain for the last three centuries—the elaboration of all those ideas of law and political economy most unsuited to the needs of the nation concerned such ideas deeply cherished in britain where they had succeeded mr gladstone was now gradually drawn forward to reverse and overthrow in ireland where they had ended in monstrous failure here a pilot’s eye might well see jagged reefs the occasion was the measure for dealing with the land of ireland that he had promised at the election the difficulty arose from the huge and bottomless ignorance of those in whose hands the power lay mr gladstone in the course of these discussions said and said truly of the learned sir roundell palmer that he knew no more of land tenures in ireland than he knew of land tenures in the moon at the beginning much the same might have been observed of the cabinet of the two houses of parliament and of the whole mass of british electors no doubt one effect of this great ignorance was to make mr gladstone dictator still ignorance left all the more power to prejudice and interests we may imagine the task the cabinet was in the main made up of landlords lawyers hardened and convicted economists—not economists like mill but men saturated with english ideas of contract of competitive rent of strict rule of supply and demand mr bright it is true had a profound conviction that the root of irish misery and disorder lay in the land question here he saw far and deep but then mr bright had made up his mind that the proper solution of the land question was the gradual transformation of the tenants into owners and this strong preconception somewhat narrowed his vision even while mr gladstone was in the middle of his battle on the church bright wrote to him may 21 ’69—       when the irish church question is out of the way we shall find     all ireland north and south alike united in demanding something     on the land question much broader than anything hitherto offered     or proposed in compensation bills if the question is to go on     without any real remedy for the grievance the condition of     ireland in this particular will become worse and measures far     beyond anything i now contemplate will be necessary i am most     anxious to meet the evil before it is too great for control and     my plan will meet it without wrong to any man   m85 “i have studied the irish land question” said bright “from a point of view almost inaccessible to the rest of your colleagues and from which possibly even you have not had the opportunity of regarding it i hope you are being refreshed as i am after the long nights in the house—long nights which happily were not fruitless i only hope our masters in the other house will not undo what we have done” mr gladstone replied the next day opening with a sentence that if addressed to any one less revered than bright might have seemed to veil a sarcasm “i have this advantage for learning the irish land question that i do not set out with the belief that i know it already and certainly no effort that i can make to acquire the mastery of it will be wanting” he then proceeds to express his doubts as to the government embarking on a very large operation of landjobbing buying up estates from landlords and reselling them to tenants and whether the property bought and sold again by the state would not by force of economic laws gradually return again to fewer hands he then comes still closer to the pith of the matter when he says to mr bright “your plan if adopted in full could only extend to a small proportion of the two or three hundred millions worth of land in ireland and i do not well see how the unprotected tenants of the land in general would take essential benefit from the purchase and owning of land by a few of their fortunate brethren” if the land question was urgent and bright himself like mill thought that it was this answer of mr gladstone’s was irrefragable in acknowledging the despatch of this correspondence from mr gladstone lord granville says to him may 26 1869—       this question may break us up bright is thinskinned the attacks     in the lords ruffle him more than he chooses to admit i cannot     make out how far he likes office the cabinet and his new     position it will be particularly disagreeable to him to have this     plan of which he is so much enamoured and for which he has     received so much blame and a little praise snuffed out by the     cabinet and yet how is it possible to avoid it even putting     aside the strong opinions of lowe cardwell and others my only     hope is that you have got the germ of some larger and more     comprehensive plan in your head than has yet been developed   the plan ultimately adopted after a severe struggle and with momentous consequences did not first spring from mr gladstone’s brain the idea of adapting the law to custom in all its depth and breadth and extending the rooted notion of tenantright to its furthest bearings was necessarily a plant of irish and not of english growth mr chichester fortescue the irish chief secretary and an irishman first opened a bold expansion of the familiar principle of many tenantright bills he had introduced such a bill himself in 1866 and the conservative government had brought in another in 1867 it is believed that he was instigated to adopt the new and bolder line by sir edward sullivan then the irish attorneygeneral away from sullivan it was observed he had little to say of value about his plan in the cabinet fortescue was not found effective but he was thoroughly at home in the subject and his speeches in public on irish business had all the cogency of a man speaking his native tongue and even genius in an acquired language is less telling what is astonishing is the magic of the rapid and sympathetic penetration with which mr gladstone went to the heart of the problem as it was presented to him by his irish advisers this was his way when acts of policy were not of great or immediate concern he took them as they came but when they pressed for treatment and determination then he swooped down upon them with the strength and vision of an eagle    ii   his career in the most deeply operative portion of it was so intimately concerned with ireland that my readers will perhaps benignantly permit a page or two of historic digression i know the subject seems uninviting my apology must be that it occupied no insignificant portion of mr gladstone’s public life and that his treatment of it made one of his deepest marks on the legislation of the century after all there is no englishspeaking community in any part of the wide globe where our tragic mismanagement of the land of ireland and of those dwelling on it and sustained by it has not left its unlucky stamp  m86 if englishmen and scots had not found the theme so uninviting if they had given a fraction of the attention to the tenure and history of irish land that was bestowed say upon the seisachtheia of solon at athens or the sempronian law in ancient rome this chapter in our annals would not have been written as it was parliament had made laws for landlord and tenant in ireland without well understanding what is either an irish landlord or an irish tenant england has been able to rule india mill said because the business of ruling devolved upon men who passed their lives in india and made indian interests their regular occupation india has on the whole been governed with a pretty full perception of its differences from england ireland on the contrary suffering a worse misfortune than absentee landlords was governed by an absentee parliament in england property means the rights of the rentreceiver who has equipped the land and prepared it for the capital and the skill of the tenant in ireland in the minds of the vast majority of the population for reasons just as good property includes rights of the cultivator whose labour has drained the land and reclaimed it and fenced it and made farmroads and put a dwelling and farm buildings on it and given to it all the working value that it possesses we need suppose no criminality on either side the origin of the difference was perfectly natural in ireland the holdings were small and multitudinous no landlord who was not a millionaire could have prepared and equipped holdings numbered by hundreds or thousands and if he could the hundreds and thousands of tenants had not a straw of capital this peculiarity in social circumstances made it certain therefore that if the moral foundation of modern ideas of property is that he who sows shall reap the idea of property would grow up in the mind of the cultivator whenever the outer climate permitted the growth in his mind of any ideas of moral or equitable right at all  in 1843 the devon commission had reported that it is the tenant who has made the improvements that large confiscations of these improvements had been systematically practised in the shape of progressive enhancements of rent that crime and disorder sprang from the system and that parliament ought to interfere a bill was proposed by the peel government in 1845 for protecting the rightful interests of the tenant against the landlord it was introduced in the house mainly composed of landlords there it had such contumelious greeting that it was speedily dropped this was a crowning illustration of the levity of the imperial parliament dealing with irish problems the vital necessity for readjusting the foundations of social life demonstrated a half measure languidly attempted attempt dropped bills sent to slumber in limbo dry rot left quietly alone for a whole generation until bloody outrage and murder awoke legislative conscience or roused executive fear the union was seventy years old before the elementary feature in the agrarian condition of ireland was recognised by the parliament which had undertaken to govern ireland before the union ireland was governed by the british cabinet through the irish landed gentry according to their views and in their interests after the union it was just the same she was treated as a turbulent and infected province within the larger island never as a community with an internal economy peculiarly her own with special sentiments history recollections points of view and necessities all her own between the union and the year 1870 acts dealing with irish land had been passed at westminster every one of these acts was in the interest of the landlord and against the tenant a score of insurrection acts no tenantright act meanwhile ireland had gone down into the dark gulfs of the famine 18467  anybody can now see that the true view of the irish cultivator was to regard him as a kind of copyholder or customary freeholder or whatever other name best fits a man who has possessory interests in a piece of land held at the landlord’s will but that will controlled by custom in ulster and in an embryo degree elsewhere this was what in a varying and irregular way actually had come about agrarian customs developed that undoubtedly belong to a backward social system but they sprang from the necessities of the case the essence of such customs in ulster was first a fair rent to be fixed not by competition but by valuation and exclusive of tenant’s improvements second the right of the tenant to transfer to somebody else his goodwill or whatever else we may call his right of occupancy in the holding  instead of adapting law to custom habit practice and equity parliament proceeded to break all this down with wellmeaning but blind violence it imported into ireland after the famine the english idea of landed property and contract or rather it imported these ideas into ireland with a definiteness and formality that would have been impracticable even in england just as good people thought they could easily make ireland protestant if only she could be got within earshot of evangelical truth so statesmen expected that a few clauses on a parchment would suffice to root out at a stroke the inveterate habits and ideas of long generations we talk of revolutionary doctrinaires in france and other countries history hardly shows such revolutionary doctrinaires anywhere as the whig and tory statesmen who tried to regenerate ireland in the middle of the nineteenth century they first of all passed an act 1849 inviting the purchase of the estates of an insolvent landlord upon precisely the same principles as governed the purchase of his pictures or his furniture we passed the encumbered estates act mr gladstone said “with lazy heedless uninformed good intentions” the important rights given by custom and equity to the cultivator were suddenly extinguished by the supreme legal right of the rentreceiver about oneeighth of the whole area of the country is estimated to have changed hands on these terms the extreme of wretchedness and confusion naturally followed parliament thought this must be due to some misunderstanding that there might be no further mistake it next proceeded formally to declare 1860 that the legal relations between landlord and tenant in ireland were to be those of strict contract186 thus blunder was clenched by blunder the cultivators were terrorstruck and agitation waxed hot  oliver cromwell had a glimpse of the secret in 1649 “these poor people” he said “have been accustomed to as much injustice and oppression from their landlords the great men and those who should have done them right as any people in that which we call christendom sir if justice were freely and impartially administered here the foregoing darkness and corruption would make it look so much the more glorious and beautiful” it was just two hundred and twenty years before another ruler of england saw as deep and applied his mind to the free doing of justice    iii   almost immediately after recovering from the fatigues of the session of 1869 mr gladstone threw himself upon his new task his imagination vividly excited by its magnitude and its possibilities “for the last three months” he writes to the duke of argyll dec 5 “i have worked daily i think upon the question and so i shall continue to do the literature of it is large larger than i can master but i feel the benefit of continued reading upon it we have before us a crisis and a great crisis for us all to put it on no higher ground and a great honour or a great disgrace as i do not mean to fail through want of perseverance so neither will i wilfully err through precipitancy or through want of care and desire at least to meet all apprehensions which are warranted by even the show of reason”  it was not reading alone that brought him round to the full measure of securing the cultivator in his holding the crucial suggestion the expediency namely of making the landlord pay compensation to the tenant for disturbing him came from ireland to mr chichester fortescue the irish secretary mr gladstone writes sept 15—       i heartily wish it were possible that you sullivan and i could     have some of those preliminary conversations on land which were     certainly of great use in the first stages of the irish church     bill as this is difficult let us try to compare notes as well as     we can in writing i anticipate that many members of the cabinet     will find it hard to extend their views to what the exigencies of     the time soberly considered now require but patience prudence     and good feeling will i hope surmount all obstacles      like you i am unwilling to force a peasant proprietary into     existence the first point in this legislation viz that the     presumption of law should give improvements to the tenant is now     i suppose very widely admitted but no longer suffices to settle     the question now as to your “compensation for disturbance”     this is indeed a question full of difficulty it is very desirable     to prevent the using of augmentation of rent as a method of     eviction i shall be most curious to see the means and provisions     you may devise without at present being too sanguine   m87 meanwhile he notes to lord granville sept 22 how critical and arduous the question is within as well as without the cabinet and wonders whether they ought not to be thinking of a judicious cabinet committee—       the question fills the public mind in an extraordinary degree and     we can hardly avoid some early step towards making progress in it     a committee keeps a cabinet quiet it is highly necessary that we     should be quite ready when parliament meets and yet there is so     much mental movement upon the question from day to day as we see     from a variety of curious utterances that of the times     included that it is desirable to keep final decisions open much     information will be open and this a committee can prepare in     concert with the irish government it also i think affords a     means of bringing men’s minds together   he tells the irish secretary that so far as he can enter into the secretary’s views he “enters thoroughly into the spirit of them” but many members of the cabinet laden sufficiently with their own labours had probably not so closely followed up the matter—       the proposition that more than compensation to tenants for     their improvements will be necessary in order to settle the irish     land laws will be unpalatable or new to several and naturally     enough you will have observed the total difference in the     internal situation between this case and that of the irish church     where upon all the greater points our measure was in a manner     outlined for us by the course of previous transactions   at the end of october the question was brought formally before the cabinet—       oct 30—cabinet 25½ we broke ground very satisfactorily     on the question of irish land nov 3—cabinet chiefly on irish     land and stiff 9—to guildhall where i spoke for the     government the combination of physical effort with measured words     is difficult 22—worked six hours on my books arranging and     rearranging the best brain rest i have had i think since     december last   the brain rest was not for long on dec 1 he tells lord granville that argyll is busy on irish land and in his views is misled by “the rapid facility of his active mind” “it is rather awkward at this stage to talk of breaking up the government and that is more easily said than done” i know no more singular reading in its way than the correspondence between mr gladstone and the duke of argyll mr gladstone trying to lead his argumentative colleague over one or two of the barest rudiments of the history of irish land and occasionally showing in the process somewhat of the quality of the superior pupil teacher acquiring today material for the lesson of tomorrow mr gladstone goes to the root of the matter when he says to the duke “what i would most earnestly entreat of you is not to rely too much on highland experience but to acquaint yourself by careful reading with the rather extensive facts and history of the irish land question my own studies in it are very imperfect though pursued to the best of my ability but they have revealed to me many matters of fact which have seriously modified my views most of them connected with and branching out of the very wide extension of the idea and even the practice of tenant right mostly perhaps unrecognised beyond the limits of the ulster custom”  then lord granville writes to him that clarendon has sent him two letters running talking of the certainty of the government being broken up “the sky is very far from clear” mr gladstone says to mr fortescue dec 3 “but we must bate no jot of heart or hope” the next day it is mr bright to whom he turns in friendly earnest admonition his words will perhaps be useful to many generations of cabinet ministers—       it is not the courageous part of your paper to which i now object     though i doubt the policy of the reference to feebleness and     timidity as men in a cabinet do not like what may seem to imply     that they are cowards it is your argument a very overstrained     one in my opinion against fortescue’s propositions and your     proposal so it reads to put them back in order of discussion to     the second place now when the mind of the cabinet has been upon     them for six weeks had the cabinet adopted at this moment a     good and sufficient scheme for dealing with the irish tenants as     tenants i should care little how much you depreciated such a     scheme in comparison with one for converting them into owners but     the state of things is most critical this is not a time at which     those who in substance agree can afford to throw away strength by     the relative depreciation of those parts of a plan of relief to     which they do not themselves give the first place in importance     it is most dangerous to discredit propositions which you mean to     adopt in the face of any who as yet do not mean to adopt them     and who may consistently and honourably use all your statements     against them nay who would really be bound to do so no part of     what i have said is an argument against your propositions if     your seven propositions were law today you would have made but a     very small progress towards settling the land question of ireland     for all this very plain speech you will i am sure forgive me   a letter from mr gladstone to fortescue dec 5 shows the competition between bright’s projects of purchase by stateaid and the scheme for dealing with the tenants as tenants—       i am a good deal staggered at the idea of any interference with     present rents but i shall not speak on this subject to others it     will be difficult enough to carry the substance of the plan you     proposed without any enlargement of it i hope to see you again     before the question comes on in the cabinet bright is very     full of waste lands and generally of his own plans considerably     at present to the detriment of yours he wants the government to     buy waste lands and says it is not against political economy but     yours is i think he will come right it appears to me we might in     the case of waste lands lend money on proper conditions to any     buyers in the case of other lands we are only to lend to     occupiers what do you think of this   m88 at this date he was still in doubt whether anybody would agree to interference with existing rents but he had for himself hit upon the principle that became the foundation of his law he put to fortescue dec 9 as a material point—       whether it is expedient to adopt wherever it can be made     available the custom of the country as the basis for     compensation on eviction and the like i cannot make out from     your papers whether you wholly dissent from this i hoped you had     agreed in it i have acquired a strong conviction upon it of     which i have written out the grounds but i shall not circulate     the paper till i understand your views more fully   lowe at the other extremity describes himself as more and more “oppressed by a feeling of heavy responsibility and an apprehension of serious danger” and feeling that he and the minority clarendon argyll and cardwell—of whom he was much the best hand at an argument—were being driven to choose between their gravest convictions and their allegiance to party and cabinet they agreed to the presumption of law as to the making of improvements to compensation for improvements retrospective and prospective to the right of new tenants at will to compensation on eviction the straw that broke the camel’s back was compensation for eviction where no custom could be proved in the case of an existing tenancy mr gladstone wrote a long argumentative letter to lord granville to be shown to lowe and it was effectual lowe thought the tone of it very fair and the arguments of the right sort but nevertheless he added in the words i have already quoted “i fear he is steering straight upon the rocks”  what might surprise us if anything in irish doings could surprise us is that though this was a measure for irish tenants it was deemed heinously wrong to ascertain directly from their representatives what the irish tenants thought lord bessborough was much rebuked in london for encouraging mr gladstone to communicate with sir john gray the owner of the great newspaper of the irish tenant class yet lord o’hagan the chancellor who had the rather relevant advantage of being of the same stock and faith as threefourths of the nation concerned told them that “the success or failure of the land bill depends on the freeman’s journal if it says we accept this as a fixity of tenure every priest will say the same and vice versâ” it was however almost a point of honour in those days for british cabinets to make irish laws out of their own heads  m89 almost to the last the critical contest in the cabinet went on fortescue fought as well as he could even against the prime minister himself as the following from mr gladstone to him shows jan 12—       there can surely be no advantage in further argument between you     and me at this stage—especially after so many hours and pages of     it—on the recognition of usage beyond the limit of ulster custom     as a distinct head you pressed your view repeatedly on the     cabinet which did not adopt it till the cabinet alters its mind     we have no option except to use every effort to get the bill drawn     according to its instructions   how much he had his irish plans at heart mr gladstone showed by his urgency that the queen should open parliament his letter to her jan 15 on the subject he told lord granville “expresses my desire not founded on ordinary motives nor having reference to ordinary circumstances”—       we have now to deal with the gros of the irish question and the     irish question is in a category by itself it would be almost a     crime in a minister to omit anything that might serve to mark and     bring home to the minds of men the gravity of the occasion     moreover i am persuaded that the queen’s own sympathies would be     not as last year but in the same current as ours to this great     country the state of ireland after seven hundred years of our     tutelage is in my opinion so long as it continues an intolerable     disgrace and a danger so absolutely transcending all others that     i call it the only real danger of the noble empire of the queen i     cannot refrain from bringing before her in one shape or another my     humble advice that she should if able open parliament    iv   public opinion was ripening the times made a contribution of the first importance to the discussion in a series of letters from a correspondent that almost for the first time brought the facts of irish land before the general public a pamphlet from mill then at the height of his influence upon both writers and readers startled them by the daring proposition that the only plan was to buy out the landlords the whole host of whig economists and lawyers fell heavily upon him in consequence the new voters showed that they were not afraid of new ideas it was not until jan 25 that peril was at an end inside the government—       jan 25 ’70—cabinet the great difficulties of the irish land     bill there are now over thank god feb 7—with the prince of     wales 314414 explaining to him the land bill and on other     matters he has certainly much natural intelligence 15—h of c     introduced the irish land bill in a speech of 314 hours well     received by the house at large query the irish popular party   lord dufferin an irish landlord watching as he admits with considerable jealousy exceptional legislation in respect to ireland heard the speech from the peers’ gallery and wrote to mr gladstone the next day “i feel there is no one else in the country who could have recommended the provisions of such a bill to the house of commons with a slighter shock to the prejudices of the class whose interests are chiefly concerned” he adds “i happened to find myself next to lord cairns when you had done he told me he did not think his people would oppose any of the leading principles of your bill”  the policy of the bill as tersely explained by mr gladstone in a letter to manning compressing as he said eight or ten columns of the times was “to prevent the landlord from using the terrible weapon of undue and unjust eviction by so framing the handle that it shall cut his hands with the sharp edge of pecuniary damages the man evicted without any fault and suffering the usual loss by it will receive whatever the custom of the country gives and where there is no custom according to a scale besides whatever he can claim for permanent buildings or reclamation of land wanton eviction will as i hope be extinguished by provisions like these and if they extinguish wanton eviction they will also extinguish those demands for unjust augmentations of rent which are only formidable to the occupier because the power of wanton or arbitrary eviction is behind them” what seems so simple and what was so necessary marked in truth a vast revolutionary stride it transferred to the tenant a portion of the absolute ownership and gave him something like an estate in his holding the statute contained a whole code of minor provisions including the extension of mr bright’s clauses for peasant proprietorship in the church act but this transfer was what gave the act its place in solid legal form  m90 the second reading was carried by 442 to 11 the minority being composed of eight irish members of advanced type and three english tories including mr henley and mr james lowther himself irish secretary eight years later the bill was at no point fought high by the opposition mr disraeli moved an amendment limiting compensation to unexhausted improvements the government majority fell to 76 “a result to be expected” mr gladstone reports “considering the natural leanings of english and scotch members to discount in ireland what they would not apply in great britain they are not very familiar with irish land tenures” one fact of much significance he notes in these historic proceedings disraeli he writes to the duke of argyll april 21 1870 “has not spoken one word against valuation of rents or perpetuity of tenure” it was from the house of his friends that danger came—       april 4—h of c spoke on disraeli’s amendment a majority of     76 but the navigation is at present extremely critical 7—h of     c a most ominous day from end to end early in the evening i gave     a review of the state of the bill and later another menace of     overturn if the motion of mr william fowler a liberal banker     which palmer had unfortunately as is too common with him brought     into importance should be carried we had a majority of only 32   to lord russell he writes april 12—       i am in the hurryscurry of preparation for a run into the country     this evening but i must not omit to thank you for your very kind     and welcome letter we have had a most anxious time in regard to     the irish land bill the fear that our land bill may cross the     water creates a sensitive state of mind among all tories many     whigs and a few radicals upon this state of things comes palmer     with his legal mind legal point of view legal aptitude and     inaptitude vide mr burke and stirs these susceptibilities to     such a point that he is always near bringing us to grief even     grey more or less goes with him   phillimore records a visit in these critical days—       april 8—gladstone looked worn and fagged very affectionate and     confidential annoyed at palmer’s conduct gladstone feels keenly     the want of support in debate bright ill lowe no moral weight     “i feel when i have spoken that i have not a shot in my locker”   as a very accomplished journalist of the day wrote there was something almost painful in the strange phenomenon of a prime minister fighting as it were all but singlehanded the details of his own great measure through the ambuscades and charges of a numerous and restless enemy—and of an enemy determined apparently to fritter away the principle of the measure under the pretence of modifying its details “no prime minister has ever attempted any task like it—a task involving the most elaborate departmental readiness in addition to the general duties and fatigues of a prime minister and that too in a session when questions are showered like hail upon the treasury bench”187  then the government put on pressure and the majority sprang up to 80 the debate in the commons lasted over three and a half months or about a fortnight longer than had been taken by the church bill the third reading was carried without a division in the lords the bill was read a second time without a division few persons “clearly foresaw that it was the first step of a vast transfer of property and that in a few years it would become customary for ministers of the crown to base all their legislation on the doctrine that irish land is not an undivided ownership but a simple partnership”188  in march mr gladstone had received from manning a memorandum of ill omen from the irish bishops setting out the amendments by them thought necessary this paper included the principles of perpetuity of tenure for the tiller of the soil and the adjustment of rent by a court the reader may judge for himself how impossible it would have been even for mr gladstone in all the plenitude of his power to persuade either cabinet or parliament to adopt such invasions of prevailing doctrine for this ten years more of agitation were required and then he was able to complete the memorable chapter in irish history that he had now opened    v   m91 neither the land act nor the church act at once put out the hot ashes of fenianism a coercion act was passed in the spring of 1870 in the autumn mr gladstone tried to persuade the cabinet to approve the release of the fenian prisoners but it was not until the end of the year that he prevailed a secret committee was thought necessary in 1871 to consider outrages in westmeath and a repressive law was passed in consequence mr gladstone himself always leaned strongly against these exceptional laws and pressed the irish government hard the other way “what we have to do” he said “is to defy fenianism to rely on public sentiment and so provide as we have been doing the practical measures that place the public sentiment on our side an operation which i think is retarded by any semblance of severity to those whose offence we admit among ourselves to have been an ultimate result of our misgovernment of the country i am afraid that local opinion has exercised habitually and traditionally too much influence in ireland and has greatly compromised the character of the empire this question i take to be in most of its aspects an imperial question” the proposal for a secret committee was the occasion of a duel between him and disraeli feb 27 1871—“both” said lord granville “very able but very bitter” the tory leader taunted mr gladstone for having recourse to such a proceeding after posing as the only man capable of dealing with the evils of ireland and backed by a majority which had legalised confiscation consecrated sacrilege and condoned high treason     chapter iii education—the career and the talents 1870       he that taketh awayweights from the motions doth the same as he     that addeth wings—pym    i   amid dire controversies that in all countries surround all questions of the school some believe the first government of mr gladstone in its dealing with education to have achieved its greatest constructive work others think that on the contrary it threw away a noble chance in the new scheme of national education established in 1870 the head of the government rather acquiesced than led in his own words his responsibility was that of concurrence rather than of authorship his close absorption in the unfamiliar riddles of irish land besides the mass of business incident to the office of prime minister might well account for his small share in the frame of the education bill more than this however his private interest in public education did not amount to zeal and it was at bottom the interest of a churchman mr gladstone afterwards wrote to lord granville june 14 ’74 “i have never made greater personal concessions of opinion than i did on the education bill to the united representations of ripon and forster” his share in the adjustments of the act was as he said afterwards a very simple one and he found no occasion either to differ from departmental colleagues or to press upon them any proposals of his own if they had been dealing with an untouched case he would have preferred the scotch plan which allowed the local school board to prescribe whatever religious education pleased it best nor did he object to a strict limitation of all teaching paid for in schools aided or provided out of public money whether rate or tax to purely secular instruction in that case however he held strongly that subject to local consent the master who gave the secular teaching should be allowed to give religious teaching also at other times even within the schoolhouse189  m92 what mr gladstone cared for was the integrity of religious instruction what he disliked or dreaded was in his own language the invasion of that integrity “under cover of protecting exceptional consciences” the advance of his ideas is rather interesting so far back as 1843190 in considering the education clauses of the factory bill of that year he explained to lord lyttelton that he was not prepared to limit church teaching in the schools in the exposition of scripture ten years later he wrote to his close friend bishop hamilton of salisbury—       i am not friendly to the idea of constraining by law either the     total or the partial suppression of conscientious differences in     religion with a view to fusion of different sects whether in     church or school i believe that the free development of     conviction is upon the whole the system most in favour both of     truth and of charity consequently you may well believe that i     contemplate with satisfaction the state of feeling that prevails     in england and that has led all governments to adopt the system     of separate and independent subsidies to the various religious     denominations   as for the government bill of that year 1853 he entirely repudiated the construction put upon some of its clauses namely “that people having the charge of schools would be obliged to admit children of all religious creeds as well as that having admitted them they would be put under control as to the instruction to be given” ten years later still we find him saying “i deeply regret the aversion to ‘conscience clauses’ which i am convinced it would be most wise for the church to adopt as far back as 1838 i laboured hard to get the national society to act upon this principle permissively and if i remember right it was with the approval of the then bishop of london” in 1865 he harps on the same string in a letter to lord granville—        suppose the schoolmaster is reading with his boys the third     chapter of st john and he explains the passage relating to     baptism in the sense of the prayer book and articles—the     dissenters would say this is instruction in the doctrine of the     church of england now it is utterly impossible for you to tell     the church schoolmaster or the clergyman that he must not in the     school explain any passage of scripture in a sense to which any of     the parents of the children or at least any sect objects for     then you would in principle entirely alter the character of the     religious teaching for the rest of the scholars and in fact upset     the whole system the dissenter on the other hand ought in my     opinion to be entitled to withdraw his child from the risk if he     considers it such of receiving instruction of the kind i     describe   mr gladstone had therefore held a consistent course and in cherishing along with full freedom of conscience the integrity of religious instruction he had followed a definite and intelligible line unluckily for him and his government this was not the line now adopted    ii   when the cabinet met in the autumn of 1869 mr gladstone wrote to lord de grey afterwards ripon nov 4—       i have read mr forster’s able paper and i follow it very     generally on one point i cannot very well follow it why not     adopt frankly the principle that the state or the local community     should provide the secular teaching and either leave the option     to the ratepayers to go beyond this sine quâ non if they think     fit within the limits of the conscience clause or else simply     leave the parties themselves to find bible and other religious     education from voluntary sources   early in the session before the introduction of the bill mr gladstone noted in his diary “good hope that the principal matters at issue may be accommodated during the session but great differences of opinion have come to the surface and much trouble may arise” in fact trouble enough arose to shake his ministry to its foundations what would be curious if he had not had the land bill on his hands is that he did not fight hard for his own view in the cabinet he seems to have been content with stating it without insisting whether he could have carried it in the midst of a whirlwind of indeterminate but vehement opinions may well be doubted  m93 the education bill was worked through the cabinet by lord de grey as president of the council but its lines were laid and its provisions in their varying forms defended in parliament by the vicepresident who did not reach the cabinet until july 1870 mr forster was a man of sterling force of character with resolute and effective power of work a fervid love of country and a warm and true humanity no orator he was yet an excellent speaker of a sound order for his speaking though plain and even rough in style abounded in substance he always went as near to the root of the matter as his vision allowed and always with marked effect for his own purposes a quaker origin is not incompatible with a militant spirit and forster was sturdy in combat he had rather a full share of selfesteem and he sometimes exhibited a want a tact that unluckily irritated or estranged many whom more suavity might have retained then without meaning it he blundered into that most injurious of all positions for the parliamentary leader of appearing to care more for his enemies than for his friends as mr gladstone said of him “destiny threw him on the main occasions of his parliamentary career into open or qualified conflict with friends as well as foes perhaps rather more with friends than foes” a more serious defect of mind was that he was apt to approach great questions—education ireland turkey—without truly realising how great they were and this is the worst of all the shortcomings of statesmanship there was one case of notable exception in all the stages and aspects of the american civil war forster played an admirable part  the problem of education might have seemed the very simplest after the extension of the franchise to the workmen everybody felt in a happy phrase of that time that “we must educate our masters” outside events were supposed to hold a lesson the triumphant north in america was the land of the common school the victory of prussians over austrians at sadowa in 1866 was called the victory of the elementary school teacher even the nonconformists had come round up to the middle of the sixties opinion among them was hostile to the intervention of the state in education they had resisted graham’s proposals in 1843 and lord john russell’s in 1847 but a younger generation eager for progress saw the new necessity that change of social and political circumstance imposed the business in 1870 was to provide schools and to get the children into them191  it is surprising how little serious attention had been paid even by speculative writers in this country to the vast problem of the relative duties of the state and the family in respect of education mill devoted a few keen pages to it in his book upon political economy fawcett without much of mill’s intellectual power or any of his sensitive temperament was supposed to represent his principles in parliament yet in education he was against free schools while mill was for them all was unsettled important things were even unperceived yet the questions of national education answer them as we will touch the moral life and death of nations the honourable zeal of the churches had done something but most of the ground remained to be covered the question was whether the system about to be created should merely supplement those sectarian private voluntary schools or should erect a fabric worthy of the high name of national the churchman hoped but did not expect the first the nonconformist broadly speaking the academic liberal and the hardgrit radical were keen for the second and they were all three well represented in the house of commons  m94 what the government proposed was that local boards should be called into existence to provide schools where provision was inadequate and inefficient these schools to be supported by the pence of the children the earned grant from parliament and a new rate to be levied upon the locality the rate was the critical element if the boards chose they could make byelaws compelling parents to send their children to school and they could with a conscience clause settle what form of religious instruction they pleased the voluntary men were to have a year of grace in which to make good any deficiency in supply of schools and so keep out the boards the second reading was secured without a division but only on assurances from mr gladstone that amendments would be made in committee on june 16 the prime minister as he says “explained the plans of the government to an eager and agitated house”  two days before the cabinet had embarked upon a course that made the agitation still more eager mr gladstone wrote the pregnant entry “june 14 cabinet decided on making more general use of machinery supplied by voluntary schools avoidance of religious controversy in local boards” this meant that the new system was in no way to supersede the old nonsystem but to supplement it the decision was fatal to a national settlement as mr forster put it their object was “to complete the voluntary system and to fill up gaps” lord ripon used the same language in the lords instead of the school boards being universal they should only come into existence where the ecclesiastical party was not strong enough in wealth influence and liberality to keep them out instead of compulsory attendance being universal that principle could only be applied where a school board was found and where the school board liked to apply it the old parliamentary grant to the denominational schools was to be doubled this last provision was mr gladstone’s own forster had told him that it was impossible to carry a proposal allowing school boards to contribute to denominational schools and the only compensation open was a larger slice of the grant from parliament    iii   the storm at once began to rage around the helmsman’s ears some days earlier the situation had been defined by mr brand the whip for his leader’s guidance the attempt he said made by fawcett dilke and others to create a diversion in favour of exclusively secular education has signally failed the opinion of the country is clearly adverse on the other hand while insisting on the religious element the country is just as strongly opposed to dogmatic teaching in schools aided by local rates “you ask me” said mr gladstone to mr brand may 24 “to solve the problem in the words ‘to include religion and to exclude dogma’ which as far as i know though it admits of a sufficient practical handling by individuals acting for themselves has not yet been solved by any state or parliament” well might he report at windsor june 21 that though the auspices were favourable there was a great deal of crude and indeterminate opinion on the subject in the house as well as elsewhere and “the bill if carried would be carried by the authority and persistence of the government aided by the acquiescence of the opposition” it was this carrying of the bill by the aid of the tory opposition that gave fuel to the liberal flame and the increase of the grant to the sectarian schools made the heat more intense the most critical point of the bill according to mr gladstone was a proposal that now seems singularly worded to the effect that the teaching of scriptures in rate schools should not be in favour of or opposed to tenets of any denomination this was beaten by 251 to 130 “the minority was liberal but more than half of the liberal party present voted in the majority”  m95 “we respect mr forster” cried dale of birmingham “we honour mr gladstone but we are determined that england shall not again be cursed with the bitterness and strife from which we had hoped that we had for ever escaped by the abolition of the church rate”192 writing to a brother nonconformist he expresses his almost unbounded admiration for mr gladstone “but it is a bitter disappointment that his government should be erecting new difficulties in the way of religious equality” under the flashing eye of the prime minister himself the nonconformist revolt reared its crest miall the veteran bearer of the flag of disestablishment told mr gladstone july 22 that he was leading one section of the liberal party through the valley of humiliation “once bit twice shy we can’t stand this sort of thing much longer” he said in a flame of natural wrath mr gladstone replied that he had laboured not to gain mr miall’s support but to promote the welfare of the country “i hope my hon friend will not continue his support to the government one moment longer than he deems it consistent with his sense of right and duty for god’s sake sir let him withdraw it the moment he thinks it better for the cause he has at heart that he should do so” the government he said had striven to smooth difficulties to allay passions to avoid everything that would excite or stimulate to endeavour to bring men to work together to rise above mere sectional views to eschew all extremes and not to make their own narrow choice the model of the measure they were presenting to parliament but to admit freely and liberally into its composition those great influences which were found swaying the community forster wrote to a friend “it does not rest with me now whether or no the state should decree against religion—decree that it is a thing of no account well with my assent the state shall not do this and i believe i can prevent it”193 insist forsooth that religion was not a thing of no account against men like dale one of the most ardent and instructed believers that ever fought the fight and kept the faith against bright than whom no devouter spirit breathed and who thought the education act “the worst act passed by any liberal parliament since 1832”  the opposition did not show deep gratitude having secured as many favours as they could hope and more than they had anticipated a proposal from the government july 14 to introduce secret voting in the election of local boards was stubbornly contested in spite says mr gladstone “of the unvarying good temper signal ability and conciliatory spirit of mr forster” and it was not until after fourteen divisions that a few assuaging words from mr gladstone brought the handful of conservative opposition to reason it was five o’clock before the unflagging prime minister found his way homewards in the broad daylight  it is impossible to imagine a question on which in a free government it was more essential to carry public opinion with the law to force parents to send children to school was an enterprise that must break down if opinion would not help to work it yet probably on no other question in mr gladstone’s career as lawmaker was common opinion so hard to weigh to test to focus and adjust of the final settlement of the question of religious instruction mr gladstone said to lord lyttelton when the battle was over oct 25 ’70—        i will only say that it was in no sense my choice or that of     the government our first proposition was by far the best but it     received no active support even from the church the national     society or the opposition while divers bishops large bodies of     clergy the education union and earliest of all i think     roundell palmer in the house of commons threw overboard the     catechism we might then have fallen back upon the plan of     confining the application of the rate to secular subjects but     this was opposed by the church the opposition most of the     dissenters and most of our own friends as it was i assure you     the very utmost that could be done was to arrange the matter as it     now stands where the exclusion is limited to the formulary and     to get rid of the popular imposture of undenominational     instruction   m96 at bottom the battle of the schools was not educational it was social it was not religious but ecclesiastical and that is often the very contrary of religious in the conflicts of the old centuries whence christian creeds emerged disputes on dogma constantly sprang from rivalries of race and accidents of geography so now quarrels about education and catechism and conscience masked the standing jealousy between church and chapel—the unwholesome fruit of the historic mishaps of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that separated the nation into two camps and invested one of them with all the pomp and privilege of social ascendency the parent and the child in whose name the struggle raged stood indifferent from the point of party strategy the policy of this great statute was fatal the church of england was quickened into active antagonism by irish disestablishment by the extinction of sectarian tests at oxford and cambridge and by the treatment of endowed schools this might have been balanced by the zeal of nonconformists instead of zeal the education act produced refrigeration and estrangement  we may be sure that on such a subject mr gladstone looked further than strategies of party “i own to you” said he to a correspondent before the battle was quite over “that the history of these last few months leaves upon my mind some melancholy impressions which i hope at some fancied period of future leisure and retirement to study and interpret” he soon saw how deep the questions went and on what difficult ground the state and the nation would be inevitably drawn his notions of a distinctive formula were curious forster seems to have put some question to him on the point whether the three creeds were formularies within the act it appears to me mr gladstone answered october 17 1870—       it is quite open to you at once to dispose of the nicene and     athanasian creeds and to decline inquiring whether they are     distinctive upon the ground that they are not documents employed     in the instruction of young children obviously no one has a     right to call on you to define the distinctive character of a     formulary such as the thirtynine articles or of any but such as     are employed in schools with respect to the apostles’ creed it     appears to me not to be a distinctive formulary in the sense of     the act besides the fact that it is acknowledged by the great     bulk of all christendom it is denied or rejected by no portion of     the christian community and further it is not controversial in     its form but sets forth in the simplest shape a series of the     leading facts on which christianity the least abstract of all     religions is based   manning plied him hard september october november 1871 the state of paris commune blazing that year tuileries and hôtel de ville in ashes and the prussian spiked helmets at the gates was traceable to a godless education—so the archbishop argued in england the christian tradition was unbroken it was only a clique of doctrinaires huxley at the head of them who believing nothing trumpeted secular education “delighted to see mr forster attacked as playing into the hands of the clergy” mr gladstone should stimulate by every agency in his power the voluntary religious energies of the three kingdoms “the real crisis is in the formation of men they are as we make them and they make society the formation of men is the work you have given to the school boards god gave it to the parents neither you nor mr forster meant this you least of all men on your side of the house glad to see you lay down the broad and intelligible line that state grants go to secular education and voluntary efforts must do the rest let us all start fair in this race let every sect even the huxleyites have their grant if they fulfil the conditions as for the schoolrate conscience it is a mongrel institution of quakerism” how mr gladstone replied on all these searching issues i do not find    iv   the passing of the act did not heal the wound the nonconformist revolt was supported in a great conference at manchester in 1872 representing eight hundred churches and other organizations baptist unions and congregational unions were unrelenting we may as well finish the story it was in connection with this struggle that mr chamberlain first came prominently into the arena of public life—bold intrepid imbued with the keen spirit of political nonconformity and a born tactician the issue selected for the attack was the twentyfifth section of the education act enabling school boards to pay in denominational schools the fees of parents who though not paupers were unable to pay them this provision suddenly swelled into dimensions of enormity hitherto unsuspected a caustic onlooker observed that it was the smallest ditch in which two great political armies ever engaged in civil war yet the possibility under cover of this section of a sectarian board subsidising church schools was plain and some cases though not many actually occurred in which appreciable sums were so handed over the twentyfifth section was a real error and it made no bad flag for an assault upon a scheme of error  m97 great things were hoped from mr bright’s return to the government in the autumn of 1873 the correspondence between mr gladstone and him sheds some interesting light upon the state into which the education act and mr forster’s intractable bearing in defence of it had brought important sections of the party—       mr bright to mr gladstone      aug 12 1873—so far as i can hear there is no intention to     get up an opposition at birmingham which is a comfort as i am     not in force to fight a contested election i am anxious not to go     to the election fearing that i shall not have nerve to speak to     the 5000 men who will or may crowd the town hall before i go if     i go i shall want to consult you on the difficult matter—how to     deal frankly and wisely with the education question i cannot     break with my “noncon” friends the political friends of all my     life and unless my joining you can do something to lessen the     mischief now existing and still growing i had better remain as     i have been since my illness a spectator rather than an actor on     the political field i hope you are better and that your     troubles for a time are diminished i wish much you could have     announced a change in the education department it would have     improved the tone of feeling in many constituencies   mr gladstone himself had touched “the watchful jealousy” of bright’s nonconformist friends by a speech made at the time at hawarden this speech he explained in writing to bright from balmoral aug 21—       the upshot i think is this my speech could not properly have     been made by a man who thinks that boards and public rates ought     to be used for the purpose of putting down as quickly as may be     the voluntary schools but the recommendation which i made might     have been consistently and properly supported by any one whose     opinions fell short of this and did not in the least turn upon     any preference for voluntary over compulsory means194   as he said afterwards to lord granville “i personally have no fear of the secular system but i cannot join in measures of repression against voluntary schools”  “there is not a word said by you at hawarden” bright replied aug 25 “that would fetter you in the least in considering the education question but at present the general feeling is against the idea of any concession on your part what is wanted is some definite willingness or resolution to recover the goodwill and confidence of the nonconformist leaders in the boroughs for without this reconstruction is of no value finance is of great moment and people are well pleased to see you in your old office again but no budget will heal the soreness that has been created—it is not of the pocket but of the feelings i want you just to know where i am and what i feel but if i could talk to you i could say what i have to say with more precision and with a greater delicacy of expression i ask you only to put the best construction on what i write”  if forster could only have composed himself to the same considerate spirit there might have been a different tale to tell bright made his election speech at birmingham and forster was in trouble about it “i think” said the orator to mr gladstone “he ought rather to be thankful for it it will enable him to get out of difficulties if he will improve the occasion there is no question of changing the policy of the government but of making minor concessions i would willingly change the policy of irritation into one of soothing and conciliation” nothing of great importance in the way even of temporary reconciliation was effected by mr bright’s return the ditch of the twentyfifth clause still yawned the prime minister fell back into the position of august the whole situation of the ministry had become critical in every direction “education must be regarded as still to a limited extent an open question in the government”  when the general election came the party was still disunited out of 425 liberal candidates in england scotland and wales 300 were pledged to the repeal of the 25th clause mr gladstone’s last word was in a letter to bright jan 27 1874—       the fact is it seems to me that the noncons have not yet as a     body made up their minds whether they want unsectarian religion     or whether they want simple secular teaching so far as the     application of the rate is concerned i have never been strong     against the latter of these two which seems to me impartial and     not if fairly worked of necessity in any degree unfriendly to     religion the former is in my opinion glaringly partial and i     shall never be a party to it but there is a good deal of leaning     to it in the liberal party any attempt to obtain definite pledges     now will give power to the enemies of both plans of proceeding we     have no rational course as a party but one which is to adjourn     for a while the solution of the grave parts of the education     problem and this i know to be in substance your opinion    v   m98 the same vigorous currents of national vitality that led to new endeavours for the education of the poor had drawn men to consider the horrid chaos the waste and the abuses in the provision of education for the directing classes beyond the poor grave problems of more kinds than one came into view the question what is education was nearly as hard to answer as the question of which we have seen so much what is a church the rival claims of old classical training and the acquisition of modern knowledge were matters of vivacious contest what is the true place of classical learning in the human culture of our own age misused charitable trusts and endowments perverted by the fluctuations of time by lethargy by selfishness from the objects of pious founders touched wakeful jealousies in the privileged sect and called into action that adoration of the principle of property which insists upon applying all the rules of individual ownership to what rightfully belongs to the community local interests were very sensitive and they were multitudinous the battle was severely fought and it extended over several years while commission upon commission explored the issues  in a highly interesting letter 1861 to lord lyttelton mr gladstone set out at length his views upon the issue between ancient and modern between literary training and scientific between utilitarian education and liberal the reader will find this letter in an appendix as well as one to sir stafford northcote195 while rationally conservative upon the true basis of attainments in “that small proportion of the youth of any country who are to become in the fullest sense educated men” he is rationally liberal upon what the politics of the time made the burning question of the sacrosanctity of endowments “it is our habit in this country” he said “to treat private interests with an extravagant tenderness the truth is that all laxity and extravagance in dealing with what in a large sense is certainly public property approximates more or less to dishonesty or at the least lowers the moral tone of the persons concerned”  the result of all this movement of which it may perhaps be said that it was mainly inspired and guided by a few men of superior energy and social weight like goldwin smith temple jowett liddell the active interest of the classes immediately concerned being hardly more than middling—was one of the best measures in the history of this government of good measures 1869 it dealt with many hundreds of schools and with an annual income of nearly six hundred thousand pounds as the endowed schools bill was one of the best measures of the government so it was mr forster’s best piece of legislative work that it strengthened the government can hardly be said the path of the reformer is not rosestrewn196    vi   m99 in one region mr gladstone long lagged behind he had done a fine stroke of national policy in releasing oxford from some of her antique bonds in 1854197 but the principle of a free university was not yet admitted to his mind in 1863 he wrote to the vicechancellor how entirely the government concurred in the principle of restricting the governing body of the university and the colleges to the church the following year he was willing to throw open the degree but the right to sit in convocation he guarded by exacting a declaration of membership of the church of england198 in 1865 mr goschen—then beginning to make a mark as one of the ablest of the new generation in parliament combining the large views of liberal oxford with the practical energy of the city of london added to a strong fibre given him by nature—brought in a bill throwing open all lay degrees mr gladstone still stood out conducting a brisk correspondence with dissenters “the whole controversy” he wrote to one of them “is carried on aggressively as if to disturb and not to settle abstract principles urged without stint or mercy provoke the counterassertion of abstract principles in return there is not power to carry mr goschen’s speech either in the cabinet the parliament or the country yet the change in the balance of parties effected by the elections will cast upon the liberal majority a serious responsibility i would rather see oxford level with the ground than its religion regulated in the manner which would please bishop colenso”  year by year the struggle was renewed even after the gladstone government was formed coleridge the solicitorgeneral was only allowed in a private capacity to introduce a bill removing the tests when he had been two years at the head of administration mr gladstone warned coleridge “for me individually it would be beyond anything odious i am almost tempted to say it would be impossible after my long connection with oxford to go into a new controversy on the basis of what will be taken and alleged to be an absolute secularisation of the colleges as well as a reversal of what was deliberately considered and sanctioned in the parliamentary legislation of 1854 and 1856 i incline to think that this work is work for others not for me”  it was not until 1871 that mr gladstone consented to make the bill a government measure it rapidly passed the commons and was accepted by the lords but with amendments mr gladstone when he had once adopted a project never loitered he now resolutely refused the changes proposed by the lords and when the time came and lord salisbury was for insisting on them the peers declined by a handsome majority to carry the fight further it is needless to add that the admission of dissenters to degrees and endowments did not injuriously affect a single object for which a national university exists on the other hand the mischiefs of ecclesiastical monopoly were long in disappearing    vii   m100 we have already seen how warmly the project of introducing competition into the civil service had kindled mr gladstone’s enthusiasm in the days of the crimean war199 reform had made slow progress the civil service commission had been appointed in 1855 but their examinations only tested the quality of candidates sent before them on nomination in 1860 a system was set up of limited competition among three nominated candidates who had first satisfied a preliminary test examination this lasted until 1870 lowe had reform much at heart at the end of 1869 he appealed to the prime minister “as i have so often tried in vain will you bring the question of the civil service before the cabinet today something must be decided we cannot keep matters in this discreditable state of abeyance if the cabinet will not entertain the idea of open competition might we not at any rate require a larger number of competitors for each vacancy five or seven or ten”  resistance came from lord clarendon and strange to say from mr bright an ingenious suggestion of mr gladstone’s solved the difficulty all branches of the civil service were to be thrown open where the minister at the head of the department approved lowe was ready to answer for all the departments over which he had any control—the treasury the board of works audit office national debt office paymastergeneral’s office inland revenue customs and postoffice mr cardwell mr childers mr goschen and lord de grey were willing to do the same and finally only clarendon and the foreign office were left obdurate it was true to say of this change that it placed the whole educated intellect of the country at the service and disposal of the state that it stimulated the acquisition of knowledge and that it rescued some of the most important duties in the life of the nation from the narrow class to whom they had hitherto been confided     chapter iv the francogerman war 1870       of all the princes of europe the king of england alone seemed to     be seated upon the pleasant promontory that might safely view the     tragic sufferings of all his neighbours about him without any     other concernment than what arose from his own princely heart and     christian compassion to see such desolation wrought by the pride     and passion and ambition of private persons supported by princes     who knew not what themselves would have—clarendon    i   during the years in which england had been widening the base of her institutions extending her resources of wealth and credit and strengthening her repute in the councils of christendom a long train of events at which we have glanced from time to time had slowly effected a new distribution of the force of nations and in mr gladstone’s phrase had unset every joint of the compacted fabric of continental europe the spirit in which he thought of his country’s place in these transactions is to be gathered from a letter addressed by him to general grey the secretary of the queen rather more than a year before the outbreak of the francogerman war what was the immediate occasion i cannot be sure nor does it matter the letter itself is full of interest for it is in truth a sort of charter of the leading principles of mr gladstone’s foreign policy at the moment when he first incurred supreme responsibility for our foreign affairs—       mr gladstone to general grey      april 17 1869— apart from this question of the moment     there is one more important as to the tone in which it is to be     desired that where matter of controversy has arisen on the     continent of europe the diplomatic correspondence of this country     should be carried on this more important question may be the     subject of differences in the country but i observe with joy that     her majesty approves the general principle which lord clarendon     sets forth in his letter of the 16th i do not believe that     england ever will or can be unfaithful to her great tradition or     can forswear her interest in the common transactions and the     general interests of europe but her credit and her power form a     fund which in order that they may be made the most of should be     thriftily used      the effect of the great revolutionary war was to place england in     a position to rely upon the aid of her own resources this was no     matter of blame to either party it was the result of a desperate     struggle of over twenty years in which every one else was down in     his turn but england was ever on her feet in which it was found     that there was no ascertained limit either to her means or to her     disposition to dispense them in which to use the language of mr     canning her flag was always flying “a signal of rallying to the     combatant and of shelter to the fallen” the habit of appeal and     of reliance thus engendered by peculiar circumstances requires to     be altered by a quiet and substantial though not a violent     process for though europe never saw england faint away we know     at what a cost of internal danger to all the institutions of the     country she fought her way to the perilous eminence on which she     undoubtedly stood in 1815      if there be a fear abroad that england has forever abjured a     resort to force other than moral force is that fear justified by     facts in 1853 joining with france we made ourselves the     vindicators of the peace of europe and ten years later be it     remembered in the case of denmark we offered to perform the same     office but we could get no one to join us is it desirable that     we should go further is england so uplifted in strength above     every other nation that she can with prudence advertise herself     as ready to undertake the general redress of wrongs would not the     consequence of such professions and promises be either the     premature exhaustion of her means or a collapse in the day of     performance is any power at this time of day warranted in     assuming this comprehensive obligation of course the answer is     no but do not on the other hand allow it to be believed that     england will never interfere for the eccentricities of other     men’s belief no one can answer but for any reasonable belief in     such an abnegation on the part of england there is no ground     whatever as i understand lord clarendon’s ideas they are fairly     represented by his very important diplomatic communications since     he has taken office they proceed upon such grounds as these that     england should keep entire in her own hands the means of     estimating her own obligations upon the various states of facts as     they arise that she should not foreclose and narrow her own     liberty of choice by declarations made to other powers in their     real or supposed interests of which they would claim to be at     least joint interpreters that it is dangerous for her to assume     alone an advanced and therefore an isolated position in regard     to european controversies that come what may it is better for     her to promise too little than too much that she should not     encourage the weak by giving expectations of aid to resist the     strong but should rather seek to deter the strong by firm but     moderate language from aggressions on the weak that she should     seek to develop and mature the action of a common or public or     european opinion as the best standing bulwark against wrong but     should beware of seeming to lay down the law of that opinion by     her own authority and thus running the risk of setting against     her and against right and justice that general sentiment which     ought to be and generally would be arrayed in their favour i am     persuaded that at this juncture opinions of this colour being true     and sound are also the only opinions which the country is     disposed to approve but i do not believe that on that account it     is one whit less disposed than it has been at any time to cast in     its lot upon any fitting occasion with the cause it believes to be     right i therefore hope and feel assured her majesty will     believe that lord clarendon really requires no intimation from me     to ensure his steadily maintaining the tone which becomes the     foreign minister of the queen   m101 heavy banks of cloud hung with occasional breaks of brighter sky over europe and all the plot intrigue conspiracy and subterranean scheming that had been incessant ever since the crimean war disturbed the old european system and cavour first began the recasting of the map was but the repulsive and dangerous symptom of a dire conflict in the depths of international politics the mexican adventure and the tragedy of maximilian’s death at queretaro had thrown a black shadow over the iridescent and rotten fabric of napoleon’s power prussian victory over austria at sadowa had startled europe like a thunderclap the reactionary movement within the catholic fold as disclosed in the vatican council kindled many hopes among the french clericals and these hopes inspired a lively antagonism to protestant prussia in the breast of the spanishborn empress of the french prussia in 1866 had humiliated one great catholic power when she defeated the austrian monarchy on the battlefields of bohemia was she to overthrow also the power that kept the pope upon his temporal throne in rome all this however was no more than the fringe though one of the hardest things in history is to be sure where substance begins and fringe ends the cardinal fact for france and for europe was german unity ever since the danish conflict as bismarck afterwards told the british government200 the french emperor strove to bring prussia to join him in plans for their common aggrandisement the unity of germany meant besides all else a vast extension of the area from which the material of military strength was to be drawn and this meant the relative depression of the power of french arms here was the substantial fact feeding the flame of national pride with solid fuel the german confederation of the congress of vienna was a skilful invention of metternich’s so devised as to be inert for offence but extremely efficient against french aggression a german confederation under the powerful and energetic leadership of prussia gave france a very different neighbour  in august 1867 the french ambassador at berlin said to the ambassador of great britain “we can never passively permit the formation of a german empire the position of the emperor of the french would become untenable” the british ambassador in paris was told by the foreign minister there that “there was no wish for aggrandisement in the emperor’s mind but a solicitude for the safety of france” this solicitude evaporated in what bismarck disdainfully called the policy of pourboires the policy of tips and pickings—scraps and slips of territory to be given to france under the diplomatic name of compensation for three years it had been no secret that peace was at the mercy of any incident that might arise  the small powers were in trepidation and with good reason why should not france take belgium and prussia take holland the belgian press did not conceal bad feeling and bismarck let fall the ominous observation that if belgium persisted in that course “she might pay dear for it” the dutch minister told the british ambassador in vienna that in 1865 he had a long conversation with bismarck and bismarck had given him to understand that without colonies prussia could never become a great maritime nation he coveted holland less for its own sake than for her wealthy colonies when reminded that belgium was guaranteed by the european powers bismarck replied that “a guarantee was in these days of little value” this remark makes an excellent register of the diplomatic temperature of the hour  then for england the french emperor observed 1867 not without an accent of complaint that she seemed “little disposed to take part in the affairs of the day” this was the time of the derby government when war seemed inevitable on the affair of luxemburg lord stanley then at the foreign office phlegmatically remarked 1867 that england had never thought it her business to guarantee the integrity of germany when pressed from prussia to say whether in the event of prussia being forced into war by france england would take a part lord stanley replied that with the causes of that quarrel we had nothing to do and he felt sure that neither parliament nor the public would sanction an armed interference on either side belgium he added was a different question general nonintervention therefore was the common doctrine of both our parties  m102 after mr gladstone had been a year in power the chance of a useful part for england to perform seemed to rise on the horizon but to those who knew the racing currents the interplay of stern forces the chance seemed but dim and faint rumour and gossip of a pacific tenor could not hide the vital fact of incessant military preparation on both sides—steadfast and scientific in prussia loose and illconcerted in france along with the perfecting of arms went on a busy search by france for alliances in the autumn of 1869 lord clarendon had gone abroad and talked with important personages moltke told him that in prussia they thought war was near to napoleon the secretary of state spoke of the monster armaments the intolerable burden imposed upon the people and the constant danger of war that they created the emperor agreed—so lord clarendon wrote to mr gladstone sept 18 ’69—but went on to say that during the king of prussia’s life and as long as the present prussian system lasted he thought no change of importance could be effected still the seed by and by appeared to have fallen on good ground for in january 1870 in a conversation with the british ambassador the french foreign minister daru suggested that england might use her good offices with prussia to induce a partial disarmament in order that france might disarm also the minister at the same time wrote a long despatch in the same sense to the french ambassador at st james’s lord clarendon perceived the delicacy of opening the matter at berlin in view of the prussian monarch’s idolatry of his army he agreed however to bring it before the king not officially but in a confidential form this would compromise nobody the french ambassador in london agreed and lord clarendon wrote the draft of a letter to loftus in berlin he sent the draft to mr gladstone jan 31 1870 for “approval and criticism” mr gladstone entered eagerly into lord clarendon’s benevolent correspondence—       mr gladstone to lord clarendon      31 jan 1870—the object of your letter on disarmament is noble     and i do not see how the terms of the draft can be improved i     presume you will let the queen know what you are about and     possibly circumstances might arrive in which she could help      7 feb—the answer to your pacific letter as reported by loftus     throws i think a great responsibility on the king of prussia      12 feb—i hope with daru that you will not desist from your     efforts whatever be the best mode of prosecuting the good design     i thought bismarck’s case on loftus’s letter a very bad one i     do not think lyons’s objections towards the close of his letter     apply in a case where you have acted simply as a friend and not     in the name and on behalf of france      18 feb—i return bismarck’s confidential letter on disarmament     as the matter appears to me the best that can be said for this     letter is that it contains matter which might be used with more or     less force in a conference on disarmament by way of abating the     amount of relative call on prussia as an argument against     entertaining the subject it is futile and he ought at any rate     to be made to feel his responsibility—which i daresay you will     contrive while acknowledging his civility      9 april—i presume you have now only in the matter of     disarmament to express your inability to recede from your     opinions and your regret at the result of the correspondence if     inclined to touch the point you might with perfect justice say     that while our naval responsibilities for our sea defence have no     parallel or analogue in the world we have taken not far short of     two millions off our estimates and have not announced that the     work of reduction is at an end which whether satisfactory or     not is enough to show that you do not preach wholly without     practising   it is a striking circumstance in view of what was to follow that at this moment when mr gladstone first came into contact with bismarck—the genius of popular right and free government and settled law of nations into contact with the genius of force and reason of state and blood and iron—the realist minister of prussia seemed to be almost as hopeful for european peace as the minister of england “the political horizon” bismarck wrote feb 22 “seen from berlin appears at present so unclouded that there is nothing of interest to report and i only hope that no unexpected event will render the lately risen hope of universal peace questionable”201 the unexpected event did not tarry and bismarck’s own share in laying the train is still one of the historic enigmas of our time    ii   m103 ever since 1868 the statesmen of revolutionary spain had looked for a prince to fill their vacant throne among others they bethought themselves of a member of a catholic branch of the house of hohenzollern and in the autumn of 1869 an actual proposal was secretly made to prince leopold the thing lingered towards the end of february 1870 spanish importunities were renewed though still under the seal of strict secrecy even the spanish ambassador in paris being kept in the dark202 leopold after a long struggle declined the glittering bait the rival pretenders were too many and order was not sure still his refusal was not considered final the chances of order improved he changed his mind and on june 28 the spanish emissary returned to madrid with the news that the hohenzollern prince was ready to accept the crown the king of prussia not as king but as head of the house had given his assent that bismarck invented the hohenzollern candidature the evidence is not conclusive what is undoubted is that in the late spring of 1870 he took it up and was much discontented at its failure in that stage203 he had become aware that france was striving to arrange alliances with austria and even with italy in spite of the obnoxious presence of the french garrison at rome it was possible that on certain issues bavaria and the south might join france against prussia all the hindrances to german unity the jealousies of the minor states the hatred of the prussian military system were likely to be aggravated by time if france while keeping her powder dry were to persevere in a prudent abstention bismarck believed that moltke’s preparations were more advanced than napoleon’s it was his interest to strike before any french treaties of alliance were signed the spanish crown was an occasion it might easily become a pretext for collision if either france or germany thought the hour had come if the hohenzollern candidate withdrew it was a diplomatic success for france and a humiliation to germany if not a king from prussia planted across the pyrenees after the aggrandizements of north german power in 1864 and 1866 was enough to make richelieu mazarin louis xiv bonaparte even louis philippe turn in their graves  on june 27 1870 lord clarendon died and on july 6 lord granville received the seals of the foreign department from the queen at windsor the new chief had visited his office the day before and the permanent undersecretary coming into his room to report gave him the most remarkable assurance ever received by any secretary of state on first seating himself at his desk lord granville told the story in the house of lords on july 11 when the crash of the fiercest storm since waterloo was close upon them—       the able and experienced undersecretary mr hammond at the     foreign office told me it being then three or four o’clock that     with the exception of the sad and painful subject about to be     discussed this evening the murders by brigands in greece he had     never during his long experience known so great a lull in foreign     affairs and that he was not aware of any important question that     i should have to deal with at six o’clock that evening i received     a telegram informing me of the choice that had been made by the     provisional government of spain of prince leopold of hohenzollern     and of his acceptance of the offer i went to windsor the     following day and had the honour of receiving the seals of the     foreign office from her majesty on my return i saw the marquis de     lavalette who informed me of the fact which i already knew and     in energetic terms remarked on the great indignity thus offered to     france and expressed the determination of the government of the     emperor not to permit the project to be carried out m lavalette     added that he trusted that her majesty’s government considering     its friendly relations with france and its general desire to     maintain peace would use its influence with the other parties     concerned i told m de lavalette that the announcement had taken     the prime minister and myself entirely by surprise204   yet two days before mr hammond told lord granville that he was not aware of anything important to be dealt with at the foreign department a deputation had started from madrid with an invitation to prince leopold at the moment when this singular language was falling from our undersecretary’s lips the duc de gramont the french foreign minister was telling lord lyons at paris that france would not endure the insult and expressing his hope that the government of the queen would try to prevent it after all as we have seen bismarck in february had used words not very unlike mr hammond’s in july  on july 5 the emperor who was at st cloud sent for baron rothschild of paris and told him that as there was at that moment no foreign minister in england he wished to send through him a message to mr gladstone he wanted mr gladstone to be informed that the council of ministers at madrid had decided to propose prince leopold of hohenzollern for the spanish throne that his candidature would be intolerable to france and that he hoped mr gladstone would endeavour to secure its withdrawal the message was telegraphed to london and early on the morning of july 6 the present lord rothschild deciphered it for his father and took it to carlton house terrace he found mr gladstone on the point of leaving for windsor and drove with him to the railway station for a time mr gladstone was silent then he said he did not approve of the candidature but he was not disposed to interfere with the liberty of the spanish people to choose their own sovereign  lord granville put pressure on the provisional government at madrid to withdraw their candidate and on the government at berlin “effectually to discourage a project fraught with risks to the best interests of spain” the draft of this despatch was submitted by lord granville to mr gladstone who suggested a long addition afterwards incorporated in the text the points of his addition were an appeal to the magnanimity of the king of prussia an injunction to say nothing to give ground for the supposition that england had any business to discuss the abstract right of spain to choose her own sovereign that the british government had not admitted prince leopold’s acceptance of the throne to justify the immediate resort to arms threatened by france but that the secrecy with which the affair had been conducted was a ground for just offence and the withdrawal of the prince could alone repair it205 austria made energetic representations at berlin to the same effect in sending this addition to lord granville mr gladstone says july 8 “i am doubtful whether this despatch should go till it has been seen by the cabinet indeed i think it should not and probably you mean this the queen recollects being told something about this affair by clarendon—without result—last year i think gramont exacts too much it would never do for us to get up a combination of powers in this difficult and slippery matter”  events for a week—one of the great critical weeks of the century—moved at a dizzy speed towards the abyss peace unfortunately hung upon the prudence of a band of statesmen in paris who have ever since both in their own country and everywhere else been a byword in history for blindness and folly the game was delicate even in the low and broken estate into which the moral areopagus of europe had fallen in these days it was a disadvantage to figure as the aggressor this disadvantage the french empire heedlessly imposed upon itself of the diplomacy on the side of the government of france anterior to the war mr gladstone said that it made up “a chapter which for fault and folly taken together is almost without a parallel in the history of nations”206  on july 6 the french ministers made a precipitate declaration to their chambers which was in fact an ultimatum to prussia the action of spain was turned into prussian action prussia was called to account in a form that became a public and international threat as bismarck put it “with the hand on the swordhilt” these rash words of challenge were the first of the french disasters on july 8 the duc de gramont begged her majesty’s government to use all their influence to bring about the voluntary renunciation by prince leopold of his pretensions this he told lord lyons would be “a most fortunate solution” of the question two days later he assured lord lyons that “if the prince of hohenzollern should on the advice of the king of prussia withdraw his acceptance of the crown the whole affair would be at an end”  on july 10 lord granville suggests to mr gladstone “what do you think of asking the queen whether there is any one to whom she could write confidentially with a view to persuade hohenzollern to refuse” mr gladstone replies—       1 i should think you could not do wrong in asking the queen as     you propose to procure if she can a refusal from hohenzollern     through some private channel 2 i suppose there could be no     objection to sounding the italian government as to the duke of     aosta 3 if in the meantime you have authentic accounts of     military movements in france would it not be right formally to     ask their suspension if it be still the desire of the french     government that you should continue to act in the sense of     procuring withdrawal   the ambassador at paris was instructed to work vigorously in this sense and to urge selfpossession and measure upon the emperor’s council on july 12 however the prospects of peace grew more and more shadowy on that day it became known that prince leopold had spontaneously renounced the candidature or that his father had renounced it on his behalf the french ministers made up their minds that the defeat of prussia must be more direct gramont told lyons july 12 that the french government was in a very embarrassing position public opinion was so much excited that it was doubtful whether the ministry would not be overthrown if it went down to the chamber and announced that it regarded the affair as finished without having obtained some more complete satisfaction from prussia so the emperor and his advisers flung themselves gratuitously under bismarck’s grinding wheels by a further demand that not only should the candidature be withdrawn but the king should pledge himself against its ever being at any time revived mr gladstone was not slow to see the fatal mischief of this new development       mr gladstone to lord granville      july 12 1130 pm—i have seen since rothschild’s     telegram207 that of lyons dated 755 pm it seems to me that     lyons should be supplied with an urgent instruction by telegram     before the council of ministers tomorrow france appealed to our     support at the outset she received it so far as the immediate     object was concerned it was immediately and energetically given     it appears to have been named by the french minister in public     inclusively with that of other powers under these circumstances     it is our duty to represent the immense responsibility which will     rest upon france if she does not at once accept as satisfactory     and conclusive the withdrawal of the candidature of prince     leopold   the substance of this note was despatched to paris at 230 am on the morning of july 13 it did not reach lord lyons till halfpast nine when the council of ministers had already been sitting for half an hour at st cloud the telegram was hastily embodied in the form of a tolerably emphatic letter and sent by special messenger to st cloud where it was placed in m de gramont’s hand at the table at which he and the other ministers were still sitting in council in the presence of the emperor and the empress208 at the same time lord granville strongly urged m de lavalette in london to impress upon his government that they ought not to take upon themselves the responsibility of pursuing the quarrel on a matter of form when they had obtained what gramont had assured lord lyons would put an end to the dispute though mr disraeli afterwards imputed want of energy to the british remonstrances there is no reason to suppose that lord lyons was wanting either in directness or emphasis what warnings were likely to reach the minds of men trembling for their personal popularity and for the dynasty afraid of clamour in the streets afraid of the army ignorant of vital facts both military and diplomatic incapable of measuring such facts even if they had known them committed by the rash declaration of defiance a week before to a position that made retreat the only alternative to the sword at the head of them all sat in misery a sovereign reduced by disease to a wavering shadow of the will and vision of a man they marched headlong to the pit that bismarck was digging for them  m104 on july 14 mr gladstone again writes to lord granville suggesting answers to questions that might be asked that night in parliament should they say that the candidature was withdrawn and that with this withdrawal we had a right to hope the whole affair would end but that communications were still continued with prussia in duty to all parties we were bound to hope that the subject of complaint having disappeared the complaint itself and the danger to the peace of europe would disappear also then he proceeds “what if you were to telegraph to lyons to signify that we think it probable questions may be asked in parliament today that having been called in by france itself we cannot affect to be wholly outside the matter and that it will be impossible for us to conceal the opinion that the cause of quarrel having been removed france ought to be satisfied while this might fairly pass as a friendly notice it might also be useful as admonition please to consider the claim in the telegrams for more acknowledgment of the conduct of prussia in parliament seems to me to deserve consideration”  on july 13 gramont asked lord lyons whether he could count upon the good offices of england in obtaining the prohibition of any future candidature at the same time giving him a written assurance that this would terminate the incident lord lyons declined to commit himself and referred home for instructions the cabinet was hastily summoned for noon on the 14th it decided that the demand could not be justified by france and at the same time took a step of which gramont chose to say that it was the one act done by the english government in favour of peace they suggested to bismarck that as the king of prussia had consented to the acceptance by prince leopold of the spanish crown and had thereby in a certain sense become a party to the arrangement so he might with perfect dignity communicate to the french government his consent to the withdrawal of the acceptance if france waived her demand for an engagement covering the future this suggestion bismarck declined july 15 to bring before the king as he did not feel that he could recommend its acceptance as he had decided to hold france tight in the position in which her rulers had now planted her we can understand why he could not recommend the english proposal to his master meanwhile the die was cast    iii   m105 the king of prussia was taking the waters of ems thither benedetti the french ambassador to his court under instructions followed him the king with moderation and temper told him july 11 he had just received a telegram that the answer of prince leopold would certainly reach him the next day and he would then at once communicate it something some say bismarck prevented the arrival of the courier for some hours beyond the time anticipated on the morning of the 13th the king met benedetti on the promenade and asked him if he had anything new to say the ambassador obeyed his orders and told the king of the demand for assurances against a future candidature the king at once refused this new and unexpected concession but in parting from benedetti said they would resume their conversation in the afternoon meanwhile the courier arrived but before the courier a despatch came from paris conveying the suggestion that the king might write an apologetic letter to the french emperor this naturally gave the king some offence but he contented himself with sending benedetti a polite message by an aidedecamp that he had received in writing from prince leopold the intelligence of his renunciation “by this his majesty considered the question as settled” benedetti persevered in seeking to learn what answer he should make to his government on the question of further assurances the king replied by the same officer that he was obliged to decline absolutely to enter into new negotiations that what he had said in the morning was his last word in the matter on july 14 the king received benedetti in the railway carriage on his departure for berlin told him that any future negotiations would be conducted by his government and parted from him with courteous salutations neither king nor ambassador was conscious that the country of either had suffered a shadow of indignity from the representative of the other  bismarck called upon the british ambassador in those days and made what in the light of later revelations seems a singular complaint he observed that great britain “should have forbidden france to enter on the war she was in a position to do so and her interests and those of europe demanded it of her”209 later in the year he spoke in the same sense at versailles “if at the beginning of the war the english had said to napoleon ‘there must be no war’ there would have been none”210 what is certain is that nobody would have been more discomfited by the success of england’s prohibition than count bismarck the sincerity and substance of his reproach are tested by a revelation made by himself long after though familiar the story is worth telling over again in the biography of a statesman who stood for a type alien to policies of fraud  m106 bismarck had hurried from varzin to berlin on july 12 in profound concern lest his royal master should subject his country and his minister to what after the menace of gramont and ollivier on july 6 would be grave diplomatic defeat he had resolved to retire if the incident should end in this shape and the chief actor has himself described the strange sinister scene that averted his design he invited moltke and roon to dine with him alone on july 13 in the midst of their conversation “i was informed” he says “that a telegram from ems in cipher if i recollect rightly of about 200 ‘groups’ was being deciphered when the copy was handed me it showed that abeken had drawn up and signed the telegram at his majesty’s command and i read it out to my guests whose dejection was so great that they turned away from food and drink on a repeated examination of the document i lingered upon the authorisation of his majesty which included a command immediately to communicate benedetti’s fresh demand and its rejection to our ambassadors and to the press i put a few questions to moltke as to the extent of his confidence in the state of our preparations especially as to the time they would still require in order to meet this sudden risk of war he answered that if there was to be war he expected no advantage to us by deferring its outbreak under the conviction that war could be avoided only at the cost of the honour of prussia i made use of the royal authorisation to publish the contents of the telegram and in the presence of my two guests i reduced the telegram by striking out words but without adding or altering to the following form ‘after the news of the renunciation of the hereditary prince of hohenzollern had been officially communicated to the imperial government of france by the royal government of spain the french ambassador at ems further demanded of his majesty the king that he would authorise him to telegraph to paris that his majesty the king bound himself for all future time never again to give his consent if the hohenzollerns should renew their candidature his majesty the king thereupon decided not to receive the french ambassador again and sent to tell him through the aidedecamp on duty that his majesty had nothing further to communicate to the ambassador’ the difference in the effect of the abbreviated text of the ems telegram as compared with that produced by the original was not the result of stronger words but of the form which made this announcement appear decisive while abeken’s version would only have been regarded as a fragment of a negotiation still pending and to be continued at berlin after i had read out the concentrated edition to my two guests moltke remarked ‘now it has a different ring it sounded before like a parley now it is like a flourish in answer to a challenge’ i went on to explain ‘if in execution of his majesty’s order i at once communicate this text which contains no alteration in or addition to the telegram not only to the newspapers but also by telegraph to all our embassies it will be known in paris before midnight and not only an account of its contents but also an account of the manner of its distribution will have the effect of a red rag upon the gallic bull fight we must if we do not want to act the part of the vanquished without a battle success however essentially depends upon the impression which the origination of the war makes upon us and others it is important that we should be the party attacked and that we fearlessly meet the public threats of france’ this explanation brought about in the two generals a revulsion to a more joyous mood the liveliness of which surprised me they had suddenly recovered their pleasure in eating and drinking and spoke in a more cheerful vein roon said ‘our god of old lives still and will not let us perish in disgrace’ ”211  the telegram devised at the berlin dinnerparty soon reached paris for a second time the 14th day of july was to be a date of doom in french history the emperor and his council deliberated on the grave question of calling out the reserves the decisive step had been pressed by marshal lebœuf the night before without success he now returned to the charge and this time his proposal was resolved upon it was about four o’clock the marshal had hardly left the room before new scruples seized his colleagues the discussion began over again and misgivings revived the emperor showed himself downcast and worn out towards five o’clock somebody came to tell them it was absolutely necessary that ministers should present themselves before the chambers gramont rose and told them that if they wished an accommodation there was still one way an appeal to europe the word congress was no sooner pronounced than the emperor seized by extraordinary emotion at the thought of salvation by his own favourite chimera was stirred even to tears an address to the powers was instantly drawn up and the council broke off at six o’clock lebœuf received a note from the emperor seeming to regret the decision to call out the reserves on lebœuf’s demand the council was convoked for ten o’clock that night in the interval news came that the ems telegram had been communicated to foreign governments as bismarck had calculated the affront of the telegram was aggravated by publicity at ten o’clock the council met and mobilisation was again considered by eleven it was almost decided that mobilisation should be put off at eleven o’clock a foreign office despatch arrived and was read at the council what was this despatch is not yet known—perhaps from the french military agent at berlin with further news of prussian preparations it was of such a kind that it brought about an instant reaction the orders for mobilisation were maintained212  m107 an inflammatory appeal was made to the chambers when a parliamentary committee was appointed a vital document was suppressed and its purport misrepresented thus in point of scruple the two parties to the transaction were not illmatched but bismarck had been watchful provident and well informed while his opponents were men as one of them said “of a light heart” heedless uncalculating and ignorant and wrong as to their facts213  on july 15 mr gladstone reported to the queen—       mr disraeli made inquiries from the government respecting the     differences between france and prussia and in so doing expressed     opinions strongly adverse to france as the apparent aggressor mr     gladstone in replying admitted it to be the opinion of the     government that there was no matter known to be in controversy of     a nature to warrant a disturbance of the general peace he said     the course of events was not favourable and the decisive moment     must in all likelihood be close at hand   “at a quarter past four” says a colleague “a cabinet box was handed down the treasury bench to gladstone he opened it and looking along to us said—with an accent i shall never forget—‘war declared against prussia’ ”214 “shall i ever forget” says archbishop tait “gladstone’s face of earnest care when i saw him in the lobby”215  the british cabinet made a final effort for peace lord granville instructed our ambassadors to urge france and prussia to be so far controlled by the treaty of paris that before proceeding to extremities they should have recourse to the good offices of some friendly power adding that his government was ready to take any part that might be desired in the matter on the 18th bismarck replied by throwing the onus of acceptance on france on the 19th france declined the proposal  just as bismarck said that england ought to have prevented the war frenchmen also said that we ought to have held the emperor back with what sanction could mr gladstone have enforced peremptory counsel was france to be made to understand that england would go to war on the prussian side short of war what more could she have done lord granville had told gramont that he had never in despatch or conversation admitted that after the french had received satisfaction in substance there was a case for a quarrel on pure form the british cabinet and their ambassador in paris had redoubled warning and remonstrance if the emperor and his advisers did not listen to the penetrating expostulations of thiers and to his vigorous and instructed analysis of the conditions of their case why should they listen to lord granville nor was there time for their precipitancy had kindled a conflagration before either england or any other power had any chance of extinguishing the blaze216  to michel chevalier mr gladstone wrote a few days later—       i cannot describe to you the sensation of pain almost of horror     which has thrilled through this country from end to end at the     outbreak of hostilities the commencement of the work of blood i     suppose there was a time when england would have said “let our     neighbours being as they are our rivals waste their energies     their wealth their precious irrevocable lives in destroying one     another they will be the weaker we shall be relatively the     stronger” but we have now unlearned that bad philosophy and the     war between france and prussia saddens the whole face of society     and burdens every man with a personal grief we do not pretend to     be sufficient judges of the merits i now mean by “we” those who     are in authority and perhaps in a condition to judge least ill     we cannot divide praise and blame as between parties i hope you     do not think it unkind that i should write thus forgive the     rashness of a friend one of the purposes in life dear to my     heart has been to knit together in true amity the people of my own     country with those of your great nation that web of concord is     too tender yet not to suffer under the rude strain of conflicts     and concussions even such as we have no material share in i think     that even if i err i cannot be without a portion of your     sympathy now when the knell of the brave begins to toll as for     us we have endeavoured to cherish with both the relations of     peace and mutual respect may nothing happen to impair them   though good feeling prevented mr gladstone from dividing praise and blame between the two governments his own judgment was clear the initial declaration of july 6 followed by the invention of a second demand by france upon prussia after the first had been conceded looked to him as it did to england generally like a fixed resolution to force a quarrel in september he wrote of the proceedings of the french government—       wonder rises to its climax when we remember that this feverish     determination to force a quarrel was associated with a firm belief     in the high preparation and military superiority of the french     forces the comparative inferiority of the germans the     indisposition of the smaller states to give aid to prussia and     even the readiness of austria with which from his long residence     at vienna the duc de gramont supposed himself to be thoroughly     acquainted to appear in arms as the ally of france it too soon     appeared that as the advisers of the emperor knew nothing of     public rights and nothing of the sense of europe so they knew     nothing about austria and the mind of the german states and less     than nothing about not only the prussian army but even their     own217     chapter v neutrality and annexation 1870       the immediate purpose with which italians and germans effected the     great change in the european constitution was unity not liberty     they constructed not securities but forces machiavelli’s time had     come—acton    i   m108 “the war is a grievous affair” mr gladstone said to brand “and adds much to our cares for to maintain our neutrality in such a case as this will be a most arduous task on the face of the facts france is wrong but as to personal trustworthiness the two moving spirits on the respective sides napoleon and bismarck are nearly on a par” his individual activity was unsparing he held almost daily conferences with lord granville at the foreign office criticised and minuted despatches contributed freely to the drafts “there has not i think” he wrote to bright sept 12 “been a single day on which granville and i have not been in anxious communication on the subject of the war” when lord granville went to walmer he wrote to mr gladstone “i miss our discussions here over the despatches as they come in very much” “i hope i need not say that while you are laid up with gout at walmer” mr gladstone wrote in october “i am most ready to start at a few hours’ notice at any time of day or night to join you upon any matter which you may find to require it indeed i could not properly or with comfort remain here upon any other terms” details of this agitating time with all its convulsions and readjustments belong to the history of europe the part taken by mr gladstone and his cabinet was for several months in pretty close harmony with the humour of the country it will be enough for us to mark their action at decisive moments  on july 16 he wrote to cardwell at the war office—       if unhappily which god forbid we have to act in this war it     will not be with six months’ nor three months’ nor even one     month’s notice the real question is supposing an urgent call of     honour and of duty in an emergency for 15000 or 20000 men what     would you do what answer would the military authorities make to     this question those of them especially who have brains rather     than mere position have you no fuller battalions than those of     500 at home or in the mediterranean if in the latter should     they not be brought home childers seemed to offer a handsome     subscription of marines and that the artillery would count for     much in such a case is most probable what i should like is to     study the means of sending 20000 men to antwerp with as much     promptitude as at the trent affair we sent 10000 to canada   the figures of the army and navy were promptly supplied to the prime minister cardwell adding with a certain shrillness that though he had no wish to go either to antwerp or anywhere else he could not be responsible for sending an expedition abroad unless the army were fitted for that object by measures taken now to increase its force       i entirely agree with you mr gladstone replied that when it     is seriously intended to send troops to antwerp or elsewhere     abroad “immediate measures must be taken to increase our force”     i feel however rather uneasy at what seems to me the extreme     susceptibility on one side of the case of some members of the     cabinet i hope it will be balanced by considering the effect of     any forward step by appeal to parliament in compromising the true     and entire neutrality of our position and in disturbing and     misdirecting the mind of the public and of parliament i am afraid     i have conveyed to your mind a wrong impression as to the state of     my own it is only a far outlook which in my opinion brings into     view as a possibility the sending a force to antwerp should the     day arrive we shall then be on the very edge of war with     scarcely a hope of not passing onward into the abyss   cardwell sent him a paper by a high military authority on which mr gladstone made two terse ironic comments “i think the paper” he said “if it proves anything proves 1 that generals and not ministers are the proper judges of those weights in the political scales which express the likelihood of war and peace 2 that there is very little difference between absolute neutrality and actual war i advise that granville should see it”  on july 25 the times divulged the text of a projected agreement in 1869 it was in truth 1867 between the french and prussian governments in five articles including one that the incorporation of belgium by france would not be objected to by prussia the public was shocked and startled and many were inclined to put down the document for a forgery and a hoax as a matter of fact in substance it was neither the prussian ambassador a few days before had informed mr gladstone and lord granville personally and in strict secrecy that the draft of such a project existed in the handwriting of m benedetti this private communication was taken by mr gladstone to have been made with the object of prompting him to be the agent in producing the evil news to the world and thus to prejudice france in the judgment of europe he thought that no part of his duty and took time to consider it in the expectation that it was pretty sure to find its way into print by some other means as indeed soon happened “for the sake of peace” bismarck explained to lord granville july 28 1870 “i kept the secret and treated the propositions in a dilatory manner” when the british ambassador on one occasion had tried to sound him on the suspected designs of france bismarck answered “it is no business of mine to tell french secrets”  m109 there were members of the cabinet who doubted the expediency of england taking any action the real position of affairs they argued was not altered the draft treaty only disclosed what everybody believed before namely that france sought compensation for prussian aggrandisement as she had secured it for italian aggrandisement by taking savoy and nice that prussia would not object provided the compensations were not at the expense of people who spoke german had all come out at the time of the luxemburg affair if france and prussia agreed how could we help belgium unless indeed europe joined but then what chance was there of russia and austria joining against france and prussia for the sake of belgium in which neither of them had any direct interest at the same time ministers knew that the public in england expected them to do something though a vote for men and money would probably suffice the cabinet however advanced a step beyond a parliamentary vote on july 30 they met and took a decision to which mr gladstone then and always after attached high importance england proposed a treaty to prussia and france providing that if the armies of either violated the neutrality of belgium great britain would cooperate with the other for its defence but without engaging to take part in the general operations of the war the treaty was to hold good for twelve months after the conclusion of the war bismarck at once came into the engagement france loitered a little but after the battle of wörth made no more difficulty and the instrument was signed on august 9                    ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  the mind of the government was described by mr gladstone in a letter to bright august 1—       although some members of the cabinet were inclined on the outbreak     of this most miserable war to make military preparations others     lord granville and i among them by no means shared that     disposition nor i think was the feeling of parliament that way     inclined but the publication of the treaty has altered all this     and has thrown upon us the necessity either of doing something     fresh to secure belgium or else of saying that under no     circumstances would we take any step to secure her from     absorption this publication has wholly altered the feeling of the     house of commons and no government could at this moment venture     to give utterance to such an intention about belgium but neither     do we think it would be right even if it were safe to announce     that we would in any case stand by with folded arms and see     actions done which would amount to a total extinction of public     right in europe   the idea of engagements that might some day involve resort to force made bright uneasy and mr gladstone wrote to him again august 4—       it will be a great addition to the domestic portion of the griefs     of this most unhappy war if it is to be the cause of a political     severance between you and the present administration to this i     know you would justly reply that the claims of conviction are     paramount i hope however that the moment has not quite     arrived you will i am sure give me credit for good faith     when i say especially on lord granville’s part as on my own who     are most of all responsible that we take this step in the     interest of peace the recommendation set up in opposition to     it generally is that we should simply declare we will defend     the neutrality of belgium by arms in case it should be attacked     now the sole or singlehanded defence of belgium would be an     enterprise which we incline to think quixotic if these two great     military powers combined against it—that combination is the only     serious danger and this it is which by our proposed engagements     we should i hope render improbable to the very last degree i add     for myself this confession of faith if the belgian people desire     on their own account to join france or any other country i for     one will be no party to taking up arms to prevent it but that the     belgians whether they would or not should go ’plump’ down the     maw of another country to satisfy dynastic greed is another     matter the accomplishment of such a crime as this implies would     come near to an extinction of public right in europe and i do not     think we could look on while the sacrifice of freedom and     independence was in course of consummation    ii   m110 by the end of the first week of august the storm of war had burst upon the world “on the 2nd of august in the insignificant affair of saarbrück the emperor of the french assumed a feeble offensive on the 4th the prussians replied energetically at wissemburg and then what a torrent what a deluge of events in twentyeight days ten battles were fought three hundred thousand men were sent to the hospitals to captivity or to the grave the german enemy had penetrated into the interior of france over a distance of a hundred and fifty miles of territory and had stretched forth everywhere as he went the strong hand of possession the emperor was a prisoner and had been deposed with general consent his family wanderers none knew where the embryo at least of a republic born of the hour had risen on the ruins of the empire while proud and gorgeous paris was awaiting with divided mind the approach of the conquering monarch and his countless host”218 this was mr gladstone’s description of a marvellous and shattering hour  talleyrand was fond in the days of 1815 at vienna of applying to any diplomatist who happened to agree with him the expression “a good european” he meant a statesman who was capable of conceiving the statesystem of the western world as a whole the events of august made the chief minister of austria now exclaim “i see no longer any europe” all the notions of alliance that had so much to do with the precipitation of the war were dissipated italy so far from joining france marched into rome austria ostentatiously informed england that she was free from engagements the czar of russia was nephew of the prussian king and german in his leanings but gortchakoff his minister was jealous of bismarck and his sympathies inclined to france and czar and minister alike nursed designs in the black sea with such materials as these mr pitt himself with all his subsidies could not have constructed a fighting coalition even the sons of stricken france after the destruction of the empire were a divided people for side by side with national defence against the invader republican and monarchic propagandism was at work internecine in its temper and scattering baleful seeds of civil war  “many” mr gladstone wrote to chevalier in september “seem so oversanguine as to suppose that it is in our power at any moment by friendly influence of reasoning to solve the problem which has brought together in the shock of battle the two greatest military powers of europe i do not see that it is an offence on our part not to interfere when the belligerents differ so widely when we have not the hope of bringing them together and when we cannot adopt without reserve the language and claims of either” material responsibility and moral responsibility both pointed to a rigid equity between the combatants and to strict neutrality the utmost to be done was to localise the war and with this aim the british cabinet induced italy austria russia and smaller powers to come to a common agreement that none of them would depart from neutrality without a previous understanding with the rest this league of the neutrals though negative was at least a shadow of collective action from which good might come if the belligerents should some day accept or invite mediation to this diplomatic neutrality the only alternative was an armed neutrality and armed neutrality has not always served pacific ends  to the german contention at one stage after the overthrow of the empire that the empress was still the only authority existing legally for france mr gladstone was energetically opposed “it embodied” he said “the doctrine that no country can have a new government without the consent of the old one” “ought we” he asked lord granville sept 20 “to witness in silence the promulgation of such a doctrine which is utterly opposed to the modern notions of public right though it was in vogue fifty years back and though it was acted on with most fatal consequences by the prussians of eighty years back” then as for mediation whether isolated or in common he saw no hope in it he said to the duke of argyll sept 6 “i would not say a word ever so gently i believe it would do great mischief as at present advised i see but two really safe grounds for mediation 1 a drawn battle 2 the request of both parties” ever since 1862 and his error in the american war—so he now wrote to lord granville—“in forming and expressing an opinion that the southerners had virtually established their independence i have been very fearful of giving opinions with regard to the proper course of foreign nations to pursue in junctures of which after all i think they have better means of forming a judgment than foreigners can possess”  in the middle of september thiers in the course of his valiant mission to european courts reached london “yesterday” mr gladstone writes sept 14 “i saw thiers and had a long conversation with him he was very clear and touching in parts but the purpose of his mission is vague he seems come to do just what he can” the vagueness of thiers did but mirror the distractions of france not even from his ingenious confident and fertile mind could men hope for a clue through the labyrinth of european confusions great britain along with four other powers recognised the new government of the republic in france at the beginning of february 1871  m111 it was about this time that mr gladstone took what was for a prime minister the rather curious step of volunteering an anonymous article in a review upon these great affairs in which his personal responsibility was both heavy and direct219 the precedent can hardly be called a good one for as anybody might have known the veil was torn aside in a few hours after the edinburgh review containing his article appeared its object he said afterwards was “to give what i thought needful information on a matter of great national importance which involved at the time no interest of party whatever if such interests had been involved a rule from which i have never as a minister diverted would have debarred me from writing” lord granville told him that “it seemed to be an admirable argument the more so as it is the sort of thing thiers ought to have said and did not” the article made a great noise as well it might for it was written with much eloquence truth and power and was calculated to console his countrymen for seeing a colossal european conflict going on without the privilege of a share in it one passage about happy england—happy especially that the wise dispensation of providence had cut her off by the streak of silver sea from continental dangers—rather irritated than convinced the production of such an article under such circumstances was a striking illustration of mr gladstone’s fervid desire—the desire of a true orator’s temperament—to throw his eager mind upon a multitude of men to spread the light of his own urgent conviction to play the part of missionary with a high evangel which had been his earliest ideal forty years before everybody will agree that it was better to have a minister writing his own articles in a respectable quarterly than doctoring other people’s articles with concomitants from a reptile fund    iii   on the vital question of the annexation of alsace and lorraine mr gladstone’s view was easy to anticipate he could not understand how the french protests turned more upon the inviolability of french soil than on the attachment of the people of alsace and north lorraine to their country the abstract principle he thought peculiarly awkward in a nation that had made recent annexations of her own upon all his correspondents at home and abroad he urged that the question ought to be worked on the basis of the sentiments of the people concerned and not upon the principle of inviolability he composed an elaborate memorandum for the cabinet but without effect on the last day of september he records “sept 30 cabinet 2146 i failed in my two objects 1 an effort to speak with the other neutral powers against the transfer of alsace and lorraine without reference to the populations 2 immediate release of fenian prisoners”  to mr bright who was still prevented by illness from attending cabinets and who had the second of the two objects much at heart he wrote the next day—       i send for your private perusal the enclosed mem which i proposed     to the cabinet yesterday but could not induce them to adopt it     presupposes the concurrence of the neutral powers they agreed in     the opinions but did not think the expression of them timely my     opinion certainly is that the transfer of territory and     inhabitants by mere force calls for the reprobation of europe and     that europe is entitled to utter it and can utter it with good     effect   the ground taken by him in the cabinet was as follows—       a matter of this kind cannot be regarded as in principle a     question between the two belligerents only but involves     considerations of legitimate interest to all the powers of europe     it appears to bear on the belgian question in particular it is     also a principle likely to be of great consequence in the eventual     settlement of the eastern question quite apart from the subject     of mediation it cannot be right that the neutral powers should     remain silent while this principle of consulting the wishes of     the population is trampled down should the actual sentiment of     alsace and lorraine be such as to render that language applicable     the mode of expressing any view of this matter is doubtless a     question requiring much consideration the decision of the cabinet     was that the time for it had not yet come any declaration in the     sense described would mr gladstone thought entail in fairness     an obligation to repudiate the present claim of france to obtain     peace without surrendering “either an inch of her territory or a     stone of her fortresses”   mr bright did not agree with him but rather favoured the principle of inviolability in november mr gladstone prepared a still more elaborate memorandum in support of a protest from the neutral powers the duke of argyll put what was perhaps the general view when he wrote to mr gladstone nov 25 1870 “that he had himself never argued in favour of the german annexation of alsace and lorraine but only against our having any right to oppose it otherwise than by the most friendly dissuasion” the duke held that the consent of populations to live under a particular government is a right subject to a great many qualifications and it would not be easy to turn such a doctrine into the base of an official remonstrance after all he said the instincts of nations stand for something in this world the german did not exceed the ancient acknowledged right of nations in successful wars when he said to alsace and lorraine “conquest in a war forced upon me by the people of which you form a part gives me the right to annex if on other grounds i deem it expedient and for strategic reasons i do so deem it”  mr gladstone notwithstanding his cabinet held to his view energetically expressed as follows—       if the contingency happen not very probable of a sudden     accommodation which shall include the throttling of alsace and     part of lorraine without any voice previously raised against it     it will in my opinion be a standing reproach to england there is     indeed the russian plan of not recognising that in which we have     had no part but it is difficult to say what this comes to   on december 20 he says to lord granville what we may take for a last word on this part of the case “while i more and more feel the deep culpability of france i have an apprehension that this violent laceration and transfer is to lead us from bad to worse and to be the beginning of a new series of european complications”  while working in the spirit of cordial and even eager loyalty to the prime minister lord granville disagreed with him upon the question of diplomatic action against annexation palmerston he said to mr gladstone in october “wasted the strength derived by england by the great war by his brag i am afraid of our wasting that which we at present derive from moral causes by laying down general principles when nobody will attend to them and when in all probability they will be disregarded my objection to doing at present what you propose is that it is impossible according to my views to do so without being considered to throw our weight into the french scale against germany with consequent encouragement on one side and irritation on the other”  like thiers mr gladstone had been leaning upon the concurrence of the neutral powers and active cooperation at st petersburg russian objects were inconsistent with the alienation of germany and they made a fatal bar to all schemes for lowering the german terms this truth of the situation was suddenly brought home to england in no palatable way     chapter vi the black sea 18701871       “you are always talking to me of principles as if your public law     were anything to me i do not know what it means what do you     suppose that all your parchments and your treaties signify to me”      —alexander i to talleyrand    i   at the close of the crimean war in 1856 by the provisions of the treaty of paris russia and turkey were restrained from constructing arsenals on the coast of the euxine and from maintaining ships of war on its waters no serious statesman believed that the restriction would last any more than napoleon’s restraint on prussia in 1808 against keeping up an army of more than forty thousand men could last palmerston had this neutralisation more at heart than anybody else and lord granville told the house of lords what durability palmerston expected for it—       general ignatieff told me that he remarked to lord palmerston     “these are stipulations which you cannot expect will last long”     and lord palmerston replied “they will last ten years” a learned     civilian a great friend of mine told me he heard lord palmerston     talk on the subject and say “well at all events they will last     my life” a noble peer a colleague of mine an intimate friend of     lord palmerston says lord palmerston told him they would last     seven years220   in 1856 mr gladstone declared his opinion afterwards often repeated that the neutralisation of the black sea popular as it might be in england at the moment was far from being a satisfactory arrangement221 were the time to come he said when russia might resume aggressive schemes on turkey he believed that neutralisation would mean nothing but a series of pitfalls much deeper than people expected222 these pitfalls now came into full view on the last day of october prince gortchakoff addressed a circular to the powers announcing that his imperial master could “no longer consider himself bound to the terms of the treaty of march 1856 in so far as these limit his rights of sovereignty in the black sea” on the merits there was very little real dispute in europe as lord granville once wrote to mr gladstone “there was no doubt about germany having at paris and subsequently always taken the russian view france made an intimation to the same effect very soon after the conclusion of the treaty and austria later italy did the same but not in so decided a manner i have frequently said in public that with the exception of ourselves and the turks all the cosignatories of the treaty of paris had expressed views in favour of modifying the article previous to prince gortchakoff’s declaration”223  m112 to have a good case on the merits was one thing and to force it at the sword’s point was something extremely different as mr gladstone put it in a memorandum that became lord granville’s despatch “the question was not whether any desire expressed by russia ought to be carefully examined in a friendly spirit by the cosignatory powers but whether they are to accept from her an announcement that by her own act without any consent from them she has released herself from a solemn covenant”224 mr gladstone not dissenting on the substance of the russian claim was outraged by the form the only parallel he ever found to gortchakoff’s proceedings in 1870 was a certain claim of which we shall soon see something made by america in 1872 “i have had half an idea” he wrote to lord granville “that it might be well i should see brunnow the russian ambassador either with you or alone all know the mischief done by the russian idea of lord aberdeen and the opposition are in the habit of studiously representing me as his double or his heir in pacific traditions this i do not conceive to be true and possibly i might undeceive brunnow a little”  in this country as soon as the news of the circular was made known the public excitement was intense consols instantly dropped heavily apart from the form of the russian claim the public still alert upon the eastern question felt that the question was once more alive as mr gladstone had said to lord granville oct 4 1870 “everybody at a time like this looks out for booty it will be hard to convince central europe that turkey is not a fair prize” from france lord lyons wrote to mr gladstone nov 14 that the russian declaration was looked upon with complacency because it might lead to a congress and at all events it might by causing a stir among the neutrals give a check to prussia as well as to russia  lord granville wrote to mr gladstone who was at hawarden nov 21—       i am very sorry to hear that you are not well of course you must     run no risk but as soon as you can you will i hope come up and     have a cabinet childers has been here he tells me there is a     perfect howl about ministers not meeting he is more quiet in his     talk than i hear some of our colleagues are but he says if there     is to be war every day lost is most injurious i have told him     that it is impossible to say that we may not be driven into it by     russia or by other foreign powers or by our own people that we     must take care of our dignity but if there ever was a cabinet     which is bound not to drift into an unnecessary war it is ours   mr gladstone replied next day—       i will frankly own that i am much disgusted with a good deal of     the language that i have read in the newspapers within the last     few days about immediate war with russia i try to put a check on     myself to prevent the reaction it engenders your observation on     drifting into war is most just though i always thought     clarendon’s epithet in this one case inapplicable as well as     unadvisable i know however nothing more like drifting into war     than would be a resort to any military measures whatever except     with reference either to some actual fact or some well defined     contingency    ii   the courses open to the british government in the face of the circular were these they might silently or with a protest acquiesce or they might declare an offensive war much deprecated by turkey herself against a nation that had peculiar advantages for defence and for an object that every other signatory power thought in itself a bad object third they might in accordance with a wonderfully grand scheme suggested to ministers demand from germany all flushed as she was with military pride to tell us plainly whether she was on our side or russia’s and if the german answer did not please us then we should make an offensive alliance with france austria italy and turkey checking russia in the east and germany in the west a fourth plan was mutely to wait on the plea that whatever russia might have said nothing had been done the fifth plan was a conference this was hardly heroic enough to please everybody in the cabinet at least it saved us from the insanity of a war that would have intensified european confusion merely to maintain restraints considered valuable by nobody the expedient of a conference was effectively set in motion by bismarck then preoccupied in his critical bavarian treaty and the siege of paris on november 12 mr odo russell left london for versailles on a special mission to the prussian king the intrepidity of our emissary soon secured a remarkable success and the episode of bismarck’s intervention in the business was important  m113 mr odo russell had three hours’ conversation with count bismarck on november 21 bismarck told him that the russian circular had taken him by surprise that though he had always thought the treaty of 1856 too hard upon russia he entirely disapproved both of the manner and time chosen for forcing on a revision of it that he could not interfere nor even answer the circular but to prevent the outbreak of another war he would recommend conferences at constantinople225 the conversation broke off at four o’clock in the afternoon with this unpromising cast at ten in the evening it was resumed it was prolonged until half an hour beyond midnight “i felt i knew him better” mr russell in an unofficial letter tells lord granville nov 30 “and could express more easily all that i had determined to say to convince him that unless he could get russia to withdraw the circular we should be compelled with or without allies to go to war” bismarck remained long obstinate in his professed doubts of england going to war but he gradually admitted the truth of the consequences to which a pacific acceptance of “the russian kick must inevitably lead and so he came round to the british point of view and felt that in our place he could not recede”  it was not hard to see bismarck’s interests the mischief to germany of another european war before paris had fallen the moral support to be derived by the tours government from a revival of the old anglofrench alliance the chances of beust and other persons fishing in the troubled waters of an extended european conflict the vital importance of peace to the reconstruction of germany—these were the disadvantages to his own country and policy of a war between england and russia these worked the change in his mind between afternoon and midnight and led him to support the cause of england and peace against gortchakoff and his circular characteristically at the same time he strove hard to drive a bargain with the english agent and to procure some political advantages in exchange for his moral support “in politics” he said “one hand should wash the other” eine hand die andere waschen muss in mr odo russell however he found a man who talked the language kept the tone and was alive to all the arts of diplomatic business and no handwashing followed when mr russell went to his apartment in the place hoche at versailles that night he must have felt that he had done a good day’s work  in the following year papers were laid before parliament and attention was drawn to the language used by mr russell to bismarck in the pregnant sentence about the question being of a nature in its present state to compel us with or without allies to go to war with russia226 mr gladstone when directly challenged replied feb 16 that the agent had used this argument without specific authority or instruction from the government but that the duty of diplomatic agents required them to express themselves in the mode in which they think they can best support the proposition of which they wish to procure acceptance mr odo russell explained to mr gladstone feb 27 that he was led to use the argument about england being compelled to go to war with or without allies by these reasons that we were bound by a definite treaty to regard any retractation of the stipulations of march 30 1856 as a cause of war227 that gortchakoff’s assumption of a right to renounce provisions directly touching russian interests seemed to carry with it the assumption of a right to renounce all the rest of the treaty that mr gladstone’s government had declared nov 10 that it was impossible to sanction the course announced by gortchakoff that therefore france being otherwise engaged and austria being unprepared we might be compelled by our joint and several obligations under the tripartite treaty to go to war with russia for proceedings that we pronounced ourselves unable to sanction finally that he had never been instructed to state to prussia that the question was not one compelling us ever to go to war notwithstanding our treaty engagements what was mr gladstone’s reply to this i do not find but lord granville had very sensibly written to him some weeks before dec 8 1870—       i am afraid our whole success has been owing to the belief that we     would go to war and to tell the truth i think that war in some     shape or other sooner or later was a possible risk after our     note in any case i would reassure nobody now promising peace is     as unwise as to threaten war a sort of instinct that the bumps of     combativeness and destructiveness are to be found somewhere in     your head has helped us much during the last five months    iii   m114 having undertaken to propose a conference bismarck did the best he could for it the british cabinet accepted on condition that the conference was not to open with any previous assumption of gortchakoff’s declaration and they objected to petersburg as the scene of operations mr gladstone in some notes prepared for the meeting of his colleagues nov 26 was very firm on the first and main point that “her majesty’s government could enter into no conference which should assume any portion of the treaty to have been already abrogated by the discretion of a single power and it would be wholly out of place for them under the present circumstances to ask for a conference as they were not the parties who desire to bring about any change in the treaty” russia made difficulties but bismarck’s influence prevailed the conference assembled not at petersburg but in london and subject to no previous assumption as to its results228  the close of a negotiation is wont to drop the curtain over embarrassments that everybody is glad to forget229 but the obstacles to an exact agreement were not easily overcome lord granville told mr gladstone that no fewer than thirteen or fourteen versions of the most important protocol were tried before terms were reached in the end lord granville’s conclusion was that as no just rights had been sacrificed it was a positive advantage that russia should be gratified by the removal of restraints naturally galling to her pride  the conference opened at the foreign office on dec 17 and held its final meeting on march 13 delay was caused by the difficulty of procuring the attendance of a representative of france jules favre was appointed by the government at bordeaux but he was locked up in paris and he and bismarck could not agree as to the proper form of safeconduct what was even more important the governing men in france could not agree upon his instructions for we must remember that all this time along with the patriotic struggle against the prussians there went on an internal struggle only a degree less ardent between republicans and monarchists it was not until the final meeting of the conference that the duc de broglie was accredited as representative of his country230 at the first formal meeting a special protocol was signed recording it as “an essential principle of the law of nations that no power can liberate itself from the engagements of a treaty nor modify the stipulations thereof unless with the consent of the contracting powers by means of an amicable arrangement”  to give a single signatory power the right of forbidding a change desired by all the others imposes a kind of perpetuity on treaty stipulations that in practice neither could nor ought to be insisted upon for instance it would have tied fast the hands of cavour and victor emmanuel in the italian transactions which mr gladstone had followed and assisted with so much enthusiasm for austria would never have assented it is moreover true that in the ever recurring eras when force truculent and unabashed sweeps aside the moral judgments of the world the mere inscription of a pious opinion in a protocol may seem worth little trouble yet it is the influence of good opinion tardy halting stumbling and broken as it must ever be that upholds and quickens the growth of right the good rules laid down in conferences and statepapers may look tame in the glare of the real world of history as it is still if we may change the figure they help to dilute the poisons in the air    iv   m115 in england opinion veered round after sedan the disappearance of the french empire had effectively dispelled the vivid suspicions of aggression the creation of the empire of a united germany showed a new europe the keen word of an english diplomatist expressed what was dawning in men’s minds as a new misgiving “europe” he said “has lost a mistress and got a master” annexation wore an ugly look meetings to express sympathy with france in her struggle were held in london and the provinces still on the whole the general verdict seemed to be decisively in favour of a resolute neutrality for in fact nobody who knew anything of the state of europe could suggest a policy of british intervention that would stand an hour of debate  one proposal favoured by mr gladstone and also i remember commended by mill was the military neutralisation of alsace and lorraine and the dismantling of the great border fortresses without withdrawing the inhabitants from their french allegiance the idea was worked out in a pamphlet by count gasparin on this pamphlet mr max müller put what mr gladstone called the fair question whether its author was likely to persuade the european powers to guarantee border neutrality “i will try to give you a fair answer” mr gladstone said jan 30 1871 “you will not think it less fair because it is individual and unofficial for a man must be a wretch indeed who could speak at this most solemn juncture otherwise than from the bottom of his heart first then i agree with you in disapproving the declaration or reputed declaration of lord derby then stanley in 1867 about the luxemburg guarantee i have in parliament and in my present office declined or expressly forborne to recognise that declaration231 secondly as to the main question it is great it is difficult but i should not despair i may add i should desire to find it practicable for i think it would be a condition fair to both parties and one on which germany would have an absolute title to insist some of the most excusable errors ever committed” he said in closing the letter “have also been the most ruinous in their consequences the smallest in the forum of conscience they are the greatest in the vast theatre of action may your country justly indignant and justly exultant be preserved from committing one of these errors” three months later when all was at an end he repeated the same thought—       the most fatal and in their sequel most gigantic errors of men are     also frequently the most excusable and the least gratuitous they     are committed when a strong impetus of right carries them up to a     certain point and a residue of that impetus drawn from the     contact with human passion and infirmity pushes them beyond it     they vault into the saddle they fall on the other side the     instance most commonly present to my mind is the error of england     in entering the revolutionary war in 1793 slow sometimes to go     in she is slower yet to come out and if she had then held her     hand the course of the revolution and the fate of europe would in     all likelihood have been widely different there might have been     no napoleon there might have been no sedan   the changes in the political map effected by these dire months of diplomacy and war were almost comparable in one sense to those of the treaty of münster or the treaty of the pyrenees or the treaties of vienna save that those great instruments all left a consolidated europe italy had crowned her work by the acquisition of rome russia had wiped out the humiliation of 1856 prussia after three wars in six years had conquered the primacy of a united germany austria had fallen as prussia rose france had fallen but she had shaken off a government that had no root in the noblest qualities of her people     chapter vii “day’s work of a giant” 18701872       we have not been an idle government we have had an active life     and that is substantially one of the conditions of a happy     life i am thankful to have been the leader of the liberal     party at a period of the history of this country when it has been     my privilege and my duty to give the word of advance to able     coadjutors and trusty and gallant adherents—gladstone    i   the most marked administrative performance of mr gladstone’s great government was the reform and reorganisation of the army in mr cardwell he was fortunate enough to have a public servant of the first order not a political leader nor a popular orator but one of the best disciples of peel’s school sound careful active firm and with an enlightened and independent mind admirably fitted for the effective despatch of business before he had been a month at the war office the new secretary of state submitted to mr gladstone his ideas of a plan that would give us an effective force for defence at a greatly reduced cost the reorganisation of the army was one of the results of that great central event from which in every direction such momentous consequences flowed—the victory of prussian arms at sadowa the victory was a surprise for even lord clyde after a close inspection of the prussian army had found no more to report than that it was a firstrate militia sadowa disclosed that a soldier serving only between two and three years with the colours could yet show himself the most formidable combatant in europe the principle of cardwell’s plan was that short enlistment is essential to a healthy organisation of the army and this reform it was that produced an efficient reserve the necessity for which had been one of the lessons of the crimean war a second but still a highly important element was the reduction of the whole force serving in the colonies from fifty thousand men to less than half that number232 “to this change” said mr cardwell “opposition will be weak for the principle of colonial selfreliance is very generally assented to” the idea as lord wolseley says that a standing army during peace should be a manufactory for making soldiers rather than either a costly receptacle for veterans or a collection of perfectly trained fighters “had not yet taken hold of the military mind in england”233 the details do not concern us here and everybody knows the revolution effected by the changes during mr gladstone’s great administration in the composition the working and the professional spirit of the army  m116 army reform first brought mr gladstone into direct collision with reigning sentiment at court in spite of pym and cromwell and the untoward end of charles i and other salutary lessons of the great rebellion ideas still lingered in high places that the sovereign’s hand bore the sword and that the wearer of the crown through a commanderinchief had rights of control over the army not quite dependent on parliament and secretary of state the queen had doubted the policy of disestablishing the church in ireland but to disestablish the commanderinchief came closer home and was disliked as an invasion of the personal rights of the occupant of the throne this view was rather firmly pressed and it was the first of a series of difficulties—always to him extremely painful perhaps more painful than any other—that mr gladstone was called upon in his long career to overcome the subject was one on which the temper of a reforming parliament allowed no compromise even if the prime minister himself had been inclined to yield as it was by firmness patience and that tact which springs not from courtiership but from right feeling he succeeded and in the june of 1870 the queen approved an order in council that put an end to the dual control of the army defined the position of the commanderinchief and removed him corporeally from the horse guards to the war office in pall mall234 this however by no means brought all the military difficulties to an end  one particular incident has a conspicuous place on the political side of mr gladstone’s life among the elements in the scheme was the abolition of the practice of acquiring military rank by money purchase public opinion had been mainly roused by mr trevelyan who now first made his mark in that assembly where he was destined to do admirable work and achieve high eminence and popularity an act of george iii abolished selling of offices in other departments but gave to the crown the discretion of retaining the practice in the army if so it should seem fit this discretion had been exercised by the issue of a warrant sanctioning and regulating that practice commissions in the army were bought and sold for large sums of money far in excess of the sums fixed by the royal warrant and vested interests on a large scale grew up in consequence the substitution instead of this abusive system of promotion by selection was one of the first steps in army reform no effective reorganisation was possible without it as mr gladstone put it the nation must buy back its own army from its own officers no other proceeding in the career of the ministry aroused a more determined and violent opposition it offended a powerful profession with a host of parliamentary friends the officers disliked liberal politics they rather disdained a civilian master and they fought with the vigour peculiar to irritated caste  the first question before parliament depended upon the commons voting the money to compensate officers who had acquired vested interests if that were secure there was nothing to hinder the crown in the discretion committed to it by the statute from cancelling the old warrant instead of this ministers determined to abolish purchase by bill obstruction was long and sustained the principle of the bill was debated and redebated on every amendment in committee and mr gladstone reported that “during his whole parliamentary life he had been accustomed to see class interests of all kinds put themselves on their defence under the supposition of being assailed yet he had never seen a case where the modes of operation adopted by the professing champions were calculated to leave such a painful impression on the mind” credible whispers were heard of the open hostility of high military personages in one of the debates of this time upon the army mar 23 1871 speakers freely implied that the influence of what was called the horse guards was actively adverse to reform mr gladstone taking this point laid it down that “military authorities without impairing in the slightest degree the general independence of their political opinions should be in full harmony with the executive as to the military plans and measures which it might propose and that only on this principle could the satisfactory working of our institutions be secured”  the correspondence with the queen was copious in one letter after mentioning that parliament had been persuaded to extend the tenure of the commanderinchief’s office beyond five years and to allow the patronage and discipline of the army to be vested in him though the secretary of state was responsible mr gladstone proceeds—       it would have been impossible to procure the acquiescence of     parliament in these arrangements unless they had been accompanied     with the declaration of mr cardwell made in the name of the     cabinet and seen and approved by your majesty that “it is of     course necessary for the commanderinchief to be in harmony with     the government of the day” feb 21 1871 and with a similar     declaration of mr gladstone on march 23 1871 also reported to     and approved by your majesty that while all political action     properly so called was entirely free yet the military plans and     measures of the government must always have the energetic     cooperation of the military chiefs of the army   m117 the end was of course inevitable235 the bill at last passed the commons and then an exciting stage began in the lords it was immediately confronted by a dilatory resolution in view of some such proceeding mr gladstone july 15 wrote to the queen as to the best course to pursue and here he first mentioned the step that was to raise such clamour—       as the government judge that the illegality of overregulation     prices cannot continue and as they can only be extinguished by     putting an end to purchase what has been chiefly considered is     how to proceed with the greatest certainty and the smallest shock     and how to secure as far as may be for the officers all that has     hitherto been asked on their behalf with this view the     government think the first step would be to abolish the warrant     under which prices of commissions are fixed as the resolution of     the house of lords states the unwillingness of the house to take     part in abolishing purchase until certain things shall have been     done it would not be applicable to a case in which without its     interposition purchase would have been already abolished   two days later july 17 the lords passed what sir roundell palmer called “their illadvised resolution” on july 18 the cabinet met and resolved to recommend the cancelling of the old warrant regulating purchase by a new warrant abolishing purchase it has been said or implied that this proceeding was forced imperiously upon the queen i find no evidence of this in the language of lord halifax the minister in attendance writing to mr gladstone from osborne july 19 1871 the queen “made no sort of difficulty in signing the warrant” after the case had been explained in the course of the day she sent to tell lord halifax that as it was a strong exercise of her power in apparent opposition to the house of lords she should like to have some more formal expression of the advice of the cabinet than was contained in an ordinary letter from the prime minister dealing with this among other matters ministers agreed that the queen had a fair right to have their advice on such a point of executive action on her part recorded in a formal and deliberate submission of their opinion the advice was at once clothed in the definite form of a minute  on july 20 mr gladstone announced to a crowded and anxious house the abolition of purchase by royal warrant the government he said had no other object but simplicity and despatch and the observance of constitutional usage amid some disorderly interruptions mr disraeli taunted the government with resorting to the prerogative of the crown to get out of a difficulty of their own devising some radicals used the same illomened word after a spell of obstruction on the ballot bill the bitter discussion on purchase revived and mr disraeli said that what had occurred early in the evening was “disgraceful to the house of commons” and denounced “the shameful and avowed conspiracy of the cabinet” against the house of lords the latter expression was noticed by the chairman of committee and withdrawn though mr gladstone himself thought it the more allowable of the two  in a letter to his brotherinlaw lord lyttelton mr gladstone vindicated this transaction as follows—       july 26 ’71—i should like to assure myself that you really     have the points of the case before you 1 was it not for us an     indispensable duty to extinguish a gross widespread and most     mischievous illegality of which the existence had become certain     and notorious 2 was it not also our duty to extinguish it in the     best manner 3 was not the best manner that which a made the     extinction final b gave the best ie a statutory title     for regulation prices c granted an indemnity to the officers     d secured for them compensation in respect of overregulation     prices 4 did not the vote of the house of lords stop us in this     best manner of proceeding 5 did it absolve us from the duty of     putting an end to the illegality 6 what method of putting an end     to it remained to us except that which we have adopted   m118 sir roundell palmer wrote “i have always thought and said that the issuing of such a warrant was within the undoubted power of the crown it did and does appear to me that the course which the government took was the least objectionable course that could be taken under the whole circumstances of the case”236 i can find nothing more clearly and more forcibly said upon this case than the judgment of freeman the historian—a man who combined in so extraordinary a degree immense learning with precision in political thought and language and added to both the true spirit of manly citizenship—       i must certainly protest against the word “prerogative” being     used as it has so often been of late to describe mr gladstone’s     conduct with regard to the abolition of purchase in the army by     prerogative i understand a power not necessarily contrary to law     but in some sort beyond law—a power whose source must be sought     for somewhere else than in the terms of an act of parliament but     in abolishing purchase by a royal warrant mr gladstone acted     strictly within the terms of an act of parliament an act so     modern as the reign of george iii he in truth followed a course     which that act not only allowed but rather suggested i am not     one of those who condemn mr gladstone’s conduct in this matter     still i grant that the thing had an ill look the difference i     take to be this mr gladstone had two courses before him he     might abolish purchase by a royal warrant—that is by using the     discretion which parliament had given to the crown or he might     bring a bill into parliament to abolish purchase what gave the     thing an ill look was that having chosen the second way and not     being able to carry his point that way he then fell back on the     first way i believe that it was better to get rid of a foul abuse     in the way in which it was got rid of than not to get rid of it     at all especially as the house of commons had already decided     against it still the thing did not look well it might seem that     by electing to bring a bill into parliament mr gladstone had     waived his right to employ the royal power in the matter i     believe that this is one of those cases in which a strictly     conscientious man like mr gladstone does things from which a less     conscientious man would shrink such a man fully convinced of his     own integrity often thinks less than it would be wise to think of     mere appearances and so lays himself open to the imputation of     motives poles asunder from the real ones237   these last words undoubtedly explain some acts and tendencies that gave a handle to foes and perplexed friends    ii   next let us turn to reform in a different field all the highest abstract arguments were against secret voting to have a vote is to have power as burke said “liberty is power when men act in bodies” but the secret vote is power without responsibility the vote is a trust for the commonwealth to permit secrecy makes it look like a right conferred for a man’s own benefit you enjoin upon him to give his vote on public grounds in the same voice you tell him not to let the public know how he gives it secrecy saps the citizen’s courage promotes evasion tempts to downright lying remove publicity and its checks then all the mean motives of mankind—their malice petty rivalries pique the prejudices that men would be ashamed to put into words even to themselves—skulk to the polling booth under a disguising cloak secrecy again prevents the statesman from weighing or testing the forces in character stability persistency of the men by whom a majority has been built up and on whose fidelity his power of action must depend this strain of argument was worked out by j s mill238 and others and drew from mr bright who belonged to a different school of liberals the gruff saying that the worst of great thinkers is that they so often think wrong  though the abstract reasoning might be unanswerable the concrete case the other way was irresistible experience showed that without secrecy in its exercise the suffrage was not free the farmer was afraid of his landlord and the labourer was afraid of the farmer the employer could tighten the screw on the workman the shopkeeper feared the power of his best customers the debtor quailed before his creditor the priest wielded thunderbolts over the faithful not only was the open vote not free it exposed its possessor to so much bullying molestation and persecution that his possession came to be less of a boon than a nuisance  m119 for forty years this question had been fought the ballot actually figured in a clause of an early draft of the reform bill of 1832 grote inspired by james mill whose vigorous pleas for the ballot in his wellknown article in 1830 were the high landmark in the controversy brought it before parliament in an annual motion when that admirable man quitted parliament to finish his great history of greece the torch was still borne onwards by other hands ballot was one of the five points of the charter at nearly every meeting for parliamentary reform between the crimean war and disraeli’s bill of 1867 the ballot was made a cardinal point general opinion fluctuated from time to time and in the sixties journals of repute formally dismissed it as a dead political idea the extension of the franchise in 1867 brought it to life again and mr bright led the van in the election of 1868 by declaring in his address that he regarded the ballot as of the first importance “whether i look” he said “to the excessive cost of elections or to the tumult which so often attends them or to the unjust and cruel pressure which is so frequently brought to bear upon the less independent class of voters i am persuaded that the true interest of the public and of freedom will be served by the system of secret and free voting” j s mill had argued that the voter should name his candidate in the polling booth just as the judge does his duty in a court open to the public eye no replied bright the juryroom is as important as the judge’s bench and yet the juryroom is treated as secret and in some countries the verdict is formally given by ballot some scandals in the way of electoral intimidation did much to ripen public opinion one parliamentary committee in 1868 brought evidence of this sort to light and another committee recommended secret voting as the cure  among those most ardent for the change from open to secret voting the prime minister was hardly to be included “i am not aware” he wrote to lord shaftesbury dec 11 1871 “of having been at any time a vehement opponent of the ballot i have not been accustomed to attach to it a vital importance but at any time i think within the last twenty or twentyfive years i should have regarded it as the legitimate complement of the present suffrage”239 in the first speech he made as prime minister at greenwich dec 21 1868 be said that there were two subjects that could not be overlooked in connection with the representation of the people “one of them is the security afforded by the present system for perfect freedom in the giving of the vote which vote has been not only not conferred as a favour but imposed as a duty by the legislature on the members of the community i have at all times given my vote in favour of open voting but i have done so before and i do so now with an important reservation namely that whether by open voting or by whatsoever means free voting must be secured”  a bill providing for vote by ballot abolishing public nominations and dealing with corrupt practices in parliamentary elections was introduced by lord hartington in 1870 little progress was made with it and it was eventually withdrawn but the government were committed to the principle and at the end of july mr gladstone took the opportunity of explaining his change of opinion on this question in the debate on the second reading of a ballot bill brought in by a private member now that great numbers who depended for their bread upon their daily labour had acquired the vote he said their freedom was threatened from many quarters the secret vote appeared to be required by the social conditions under which they lived and therefore it had become a necessity and a duty to give effect to the principle  m120 yet after the cabinet had decided to make the ballot a ministerial measure the head of the cabinet makes a rather pensive entry in his diary “july 27 1870—h of c spoke on ballot and voted in 324230 with mind satisfied and as to feeling a lingering reluctance” how far this reluctance was due to misgivings on the merits of the ballot how far to the doubts that haunt every ministerial leader as to the possibilities of parliamentary time we do not know the bill enlarged and reintroduced next year was entrusted to the hands of mr forster—himself like mr gladstone a latish convert to the principle of secret voting—and by forster’s persistent force and capacity for hard and heavy labour after some eighteen days in committee it passed through the house of commons  after obstruction had been at last broken down other wellknown resources of civilisation remained and the lords threw out the bill240 it was novel they said it was dangerous it had not been considered by the country or parliament after eighteen days of committee and forty years of public discussion it was incoherent and contradictory and to enact vote by ballot was inevitably to overthrow the monarchy even the mightiest of american orators had said as much “above all things” daniel webster had adjured lord shaftesbury “resist to the very last the introduction of the ballot for as a republican i tell you that the ballot can never coexist with monarchical institutions”  the rejection by the lords stimulated popular insistence at whitby in the autumn sept 2 mr gladstone said the people’s bill had been passed by the people’s house and when it was next presented at the door of the house of lords it would be with an authoritative knock he told lord houghton that he was sorry to see the agitation apparently rising against the house of lords though he had a strong opinion about the imprudence of its conduct on the army bill and especially on the ballot bill “there is no duke of wellington in these days his reputation as a domestic statesman seems to me to rest almost entirely on his leadership of the peers between 1832 and 1841”  the bill was again passed through the commons in 1872 mr gladstone was prepared for strong measures the cabinet decided that if the house of lords should hold to what the prime minister styled “the strange provision for optional secrecy” the government would withdraw the bill and try an autumn session and if the lords still hardened their hearts “there would remain nothing but the last alternative to consider”—these words i assume meaning a dissolution perhaps the opposition thought that a dissolution on the ballot might give to the ministerial antæus fresh energy this time the lords gave way satisfied that the measure had now at last been more adequately discussed—the said discussion really consisting in no more than an adequate amount of violent language out of doors against the principle of a hereditary legislature241  the results of the general election two years later as they affected party are an instructive comment on all this trepidation and alarm in one only of the three kingdoms the ballot helped to make a truly vital difference it dislodged the political power of the irish landlord in england its influence made for purity freedom and decency but it developed no new sources of liberal strength on this aspect of things the first parliamentary precursor of the ballot made remarks that are worth a few lines of digression “you will feel great satisfaction” his wife said to grote one morning at their breakfast “at seeing your once favourite measure triumph over all obstacles” “since the wide expansion of the voting element” the historian replied “i confess that the value of the ballot has sunk in my estimation i don’t in fact think the elections will be affected by it one way or another as far as party interests are concerned” “still” his interlocutor persisted “you will at all events get at the genuine preference of the constituency” “no doubt but then again i have come to perceive that the choice between one man and another among the english people signifies less than i used formerly to think it did the english mind is much of one pattern take whatsoever class you will the same favourite prejudices amiable and otherwise the same antipathies coupled with illregulated though benevolent efforts to eradicate human evils are wellnigh universal a house of commons cannot afford to be above its own constituencies in intelligence knowledge or patriotism”242 in all this the element of truth is profound enough in every change of political machinery the reformer promises and expects a new heaven and a new earth then standing forces of national tradition character and institution assert their strength our millennium lags and the chilled enthusiast sighs he is unreasonable as are all those who expect more from life and the world than life and the world have to give yet here at least the reformer has not failed the efficacy of secret voting is negative if we will but it averts obvious mischiefs alike from old privileged orders in states and churches and from new    iii   m121 in finance the country looked for wonders ministers were called the cabinet of financiers the cabinet did in fact contain as many as five men who were at one time or another chancellors of the exchequer and its chief was recognised through europe as the most successful financier of the age no trailing cloud of glory as in 1853 or 1860 attended the great ministry but sound and substantial results were achieved testifying to a thrifty and skilful management such as might have satisfied the ambition of a generation of chancellors the head of the new government promised retrenchment as soon as the government was formed he told his constituents at greenwich dec 21 1868 that he was himself responsible for having taken the earliest opportunity of directing the public mind to the subject of expenditure at an opening stage of the late election for “although there may be times when the public mind may become comparatively relaxed in regard to the general principles of economy and thrift it is the special duty of public men to watch the very beginnings of evil in that department it is a very easy thing to notice these mischiefs when they have grown to a gigantic size but it commonly happens that when financial error has arisen to those dimensions the case has become too aggravated for a remedy” he reminded them of the addition that had been made to the standing charges of the country in the ordinary and steadily recurring annual estimates presented to parliament he said that he knew no reason why three millions should have been added during the two years of tory government to the cost of our establishments—       it is one thing i am very well aware to put on three millions     it is another thing to take them off when you put three millions     on to the public expenditure you create a number of new     relations a number of new offices a number of new claims a     number of new expectations and you can’t and what is more you     ought not to destroy all these in a moment and therefore the     work of retrenchment must be a wellconsidered and a gradual work     but i ask you to look at the names of the men who have been     placed in charge of the great spending departments of the country     the study the idea that has governed the formation of the present     administration has been to place able and upright men in charge of     the public purse—men of administrative experience men of proved     ability men lastly holding their seats in the house of commons     and therefore immediately responsible to the representatives of     the people it would not become me to promise what we can do but     this i can tell you that my friends connected with the various     departments most concerned in the public expenditure have even     before the early moment at which i speak directed their very     first attention to this subject and that i for one shall be as     deeply disappointed as you can be if in the estimates which it     will be our duty to present in february you do not already     perceive some results of their opening labours   one of mr gladstone’s first letters to a colleague was addressed to mr lowe containing such hints and instructions upon treasury administration as a veteran pilot might give about lights buoys channels currents to a new captain “no man wants so much sympathy” he said “as the chancellor of the exchequer no man gets so little nor is there any position so lamentable for him as to be defeated in proposing some new charge on the public conceived or adopted by himself he is like an ancient soldier wounded in the back whereas even defeat in resisting the raids of the house of commons on the public purse is honourable and always turns out well in the end” he sent mr lowe a list of the subjects that he had tried in parliament without success and of those that he had in his head but was not able to take in hand they make a fine example of an active and reforming mind243 “what commonly happened in cases of this kind in my time was as follows the opposition waited for a development of discontent and resistance among some small fraction of liberal members when this was compact in itself or was at all stimulated by constituencies they sent out habitually strong party whips and either beat me or forced me to withdraw in order to avoid beating or exposing our men to local disadvantage this game i hope will not be quite so easy now”  m122 the first two of mr lowe’s budgets were on the lines thus traced beforehand the shilling duty on a quarter of corn was abolished—“an exceeding strong case” as mr gladstone called it—taxes on conveyances were adjusted and the duty on fire insurance was removed the only notable contribution to the standing problem of widening the base of taxation was the proposal to put a tax on matches244 this was a notion borrowed from the united states and much approved by mr wells the eminent freetrade financier of that country in england it was greeted with violent disfavour it was denounced as reactionary as violating the first principles of fiscal administration and as the very worst tax that had been proposed within recent memory for is not a match a necessary of life and to tax a necessary of life is to go against adam smith and the books the money it was said ought to have been got either by raising the taxes on tea and sugar or else by putting the shilling duty back on corn again though for that matter tea sugar and corn are quite as much necessaries of life as say twothirds of the matches used245 no care however was given to serious argument in fact the tax was hardly argued at all some hundreds of poor women employed at a large match factory in the east end of london trooped to protest at westminster and the tax was quickly dropped it was perhaps unlucky that the proposal happened to be associated with mr lowe for his uncomplimentary criticisms on the working class four or five years before were neither forgotten nor forgiven a latin pun that he meant to print on the proposed halfpenny match stamp ex luce lucellum “a little gain out of a little light” was good enough to divert a college common room but it seemed flippant to people who expected to see the bread taken out of their mouths  on the other side of the national account mr gladstone was more successful he fought with all his strength for a reduction of the public burdens and in at least one of these persistent battles with colleagues of a less economising mind than himself he came near to a breach within the walls of his cabinet in this thankless region he was not always zealously seconded on dec 14 1871 he enters in his diary “cabinet 37 for two and a half hours we discussed army estimates mainly on reduction and the chancellor of exchequer did not speak one word” the result is worth recording when mr gladstone was at the exchequer the charge on naval military and civil expenditure had been reduced between 1860 and 1865 from thirtyeight millions to thirtyone under the derbydisraeli government the figure rose in two or three years to thirtyfour millions and threequarters by 1873 it had been brought down again to little more than thirtytwo millions and a quarter246 that these great reductions were effected without any sacrifice of the necessary strength and efficiency of the forces may be inferred from the fact that for ten years under successive administrations the charge on navy and army underwent no substantial augmentation the process had been made easier or made possible by the necessity under which the german war laid france then our only rival in naval force to reduce her expenditure upon new ships the number of seamen was maintained but a reduction was effected in the inefficient vessels in the foreign squadrons two costly and almost useless dockyards were suppressed much to the disadvantage of mr gladstone’s own constituents and great abuses were remedied in the dockyards that were left in the army reduction was made possible without lessening the requisite strength by the withdrawal of troops from canada new zealand and the cape this was due to the wise policy of lord granville and mr gladstone in spite of the increased cost of education of army purchase of the rise of prices and all the other causes that swell estimates the country was still spending no more in 1873 than when mr gladstone took office in 1868247 to this story we have to add that nearly thirty millions of debt were paid off in the five years well might men point to such a record as the best proof that the promises of economy made at the hustings had been seriously kept248  m123 when the time came for him to take stock of his own performances mr lowe who was apt to be cleverer than he was wise made a speech at sheffield in september 1873 that almost recalls the selflaudation of cicero over the immortal glories of his consulate he disclaimed any share of the admirable genius for finance that had been seen in pitt peel or gladstone but he had read in the latin grammar that economy was a great revenue and he thought that he could at least discharge the humble task of hindering extravagance “the first thing i did as chancellor of the exchequer” he said “was to issue an order that no new expenditure whatever would be allowed without my opinion first being taken upon it in an evil hour for my own peace and quietness i took upon myself—i believe it was never taken upon himself by any chancellor of the exchequer before—the duty of protecting the revenue instead of leaving it to be done by an inferior official” after reciting his figures he wound up with a resounding pæan “so far as i am aware up to the present time there is no one who can challenge comparison with what has been done during these years sir r peel and mr gladstone routed out protection in your trade a measure that conferred immortal honour on them but so far as relieving you from taxation is concerned i believe you would seek in vain in british history for anything like what has been done during these last four years” this strange vein was more than a little distasteful to the prime minister as a letter to lord granville upon it shows sept 9 1873—       lowe’s speech at sheffield is really too bad and free as it is     from all evil intention it illustrates the invariable solecisms     of his extraordinary mind he says no chancellor of the     exchequer before did treasury business but left it to a     subordinate official some have done more some less no one     probably as much as lowe but some almost as much i did less     perhaps much less but i hold that the first duties of the     chancellor of the exchequer are outside the treasury one of them     is to look after and control the great expenditures and estimates     in this duty i am sorry to say he was wretchedly deficient yet he     coolly takes to himself the credit of army and navy reductions     which is due to cardwell and childers who in his admirable     speech did not say a word i think for himself and with which     every member of the cabinet had almost as much to do as he had i     can speak from experience for i know what it has been to have had     cast upon my shoulders the most important and most offensive duty     of the financial minister he has ample merit to stand on in a     great amount of labour done and generally well done and with     good results for the public much of the unpopularity is unjust a     little patience would set all right     chapter viii autumn of 1871 decline of popularity 18711872       for the present at least the reformation will operate against the     reformers nothing is more common than for men to wish and call     loudly too for a reformation who when it arrives do by no means     like the severity of its aspect reformation is one of those     pieces which must be put at some distance in order to please its     greatest favourers love it better in the abstract than in the     substance      —burke    i   in july 1871 mr gladstone paid a sunday visit to tennyson among the surrey hills they had two interesting days “with talk ranging everywhere” the poet read the holy grail which mr gladstone admired they discussed the goschen parish council plan and other social reforms lacordaire and liberal collectivism politics and the stormy times ahead mr gladstone assured them that he was a conservative and feared extreme measures from the opposition “a very noble fellow” tennyson called him “and perfectly unaffected”249 mr gladstone for his part records in his diary that he found “a characteristic and delightful abode in tennyson are singularly united true greatness genuine simplicity and some eccentricity but the latter is from habit and circumstance the former is his nature his wife is excellent and in her adaptation to him wonderful his son hallam is most attractive”  after a laborious and irksome session “in which we have sat i believe 150 hours after midnight” the house rose aug 21 mr gladstone spent some time at whitby with his family and made a speech to his eldest son’s constituents sept 2 on the ballot and protesting against the spirit of “alarmism” towards the end of the month he went on to balmoral on september 26 he was presented with the freedom of aberdeen and made a speech on irish home rule of which as we shall see he heard a great deal fifteen years later—       to mrs gladstone      balmoral sept 28—the time is rolling on easily at this     quiet place we breakfast six or eight the prince and     princess louis of hesse dine most days today i walked with her     and her party she is quick kind and well informed i got her     today on the subject of the religious movement in the roman     catholic church in germany she is imbued with her father’s ideas     and i think goes beyond them she quoted strauss to me as     giving his opinion that the movement would come to nothing she     said the infallibility was the legitimate development of the roman     system i replied that the roman system had grown up by a     multitude of scarcely perceptible degrees out of the earliest form     of christianity and if we adopted this notion of legitimate     development we ran a risk of making saint paul responsible for     the vatican council she talked much about the hospitals in which     she worked so hard while nursing her baby a very fine one whom     she introduced to me with two flourishing elder children she     hates war and is not easy as to the future      sept 29—i have had a twelvemile stretch today almost all on     wild ground and so solitary not a living creature except three     brace of grouse all the way i am glad to report that i came in     very fresh  what a mess the bishop of winchester has made of     this glengarry kirk business      sept 30—last night we dined ten at abergeldie the prince of     wales had his usual pleasant manners he is far lighter in hand     than the duke of edinburgh after dinner he invited me to play     whist i said “for love sir” he said “well shillings and     halfacrown on the rubber” to which i submitted ponsonby and i     against the prince and brasseur a charming old frenchman his     tutor in the language the prince has apparently an immense     whist memory and plays well accordingly today the queen was to     have seen me at six but sent to postpone it till tomorrow on     account of expecting the princess of wales who was to come over     and pay her a visit from abergeldie i think she is nervous and     shrinks from talk but i do not mean to say a word that would give     her trouble as there would be no good in it at this moment      oct 3—i have seen the queen again this morning she conversed     longer near an hour and was visibly better and stronger and in     good spirits she told me much about her illness  she wished     me a pleasant journey      ballater oct 4—here am i ensconced in the stationmaster’s     box at ballater after a 15 or 16 mile walk round through the     hills the regular train being postponed for an hour or more to     let the couple from mar lodge go off special they had two     carriages laden with luggage besides their own carriage i hope     to be at colwyn soon after six these solitary walks among the     hills i think refresh and invigorate me more than anything else     today the early part of the day was glorious and the wind most     bracing as it came over the mass of mountains i bade farewell     reluctantly to balmoral for it is as homelike as any place away     from home can be and wonderfully safe from invasions i had all     the grand mountains in view at once with their snow caps the     lowest about the same as snowdon i came by the falls of the     muich which after the rain were very fine i had an interesting     conversation with princess louise about the queen this morning      oct 4—nothing sets me up in mind and body like a mountain     solitude not even perhaps the sea walked from balmoral to     ballater 15 miles in 4 hrs 5 m 6—walked 20 miles in 5 hrs     and 45 minutes 7—walked 15 miles—diary      to mrs gladstone      ainslie place edinburgh oct 8 1871—i got here last night     before seven and had the most affectionate welcome from the dean     that you can conceive a dinnerparty followed and now i have for     the first time since the government was formed had a holiday of     two whole days last night the lord advocate tried to talk to me     about the scotch endowed schools and i refused to have anything to     say to him i have no time to write about my walk beyond this     that it was quite successful the dean ramsay preached at st     john’s this morning about ruth the sermon was beautiful and the     voice and manner with his venerable age made it very striking he     put an astonishing energy into it and his clear melodious tones     rang through and through as they did when i first heard him 43½     years ago it was altogether most touching and he told me     afterwards that he had wished to preach to me once more before he     died but i rejoice to say his life seems a very good one i would     not have missed the occasion for much      london oct 27—went to sir r murchison’s funeral the last of     those who had known me or of me from infancy and so a step     towards the end is made visible it was a great funeral 28—my     expedition to greenwich or rather blackheath i spoke 1 h 50     m too long yet really not long enough for a full development of     my points physically rather an excess of effort all went well     thank god—diary   m124 this speech at blackheath was a fine illustration both of mr gladstone’s extraordinary power and of the sure respect of a british audience for manful handling and firm dealing in a minister if only the appeal be high enough it was one of the marked scenes of his life in the cold mist of the october afternoon he stood bareheaded pale resolute before a surging audience of many thousands few of them enthusiastically his friends a considerable mass of them dockyard workmen furious at discharge or neglect by an economising government he was received with loud and angry murmurs ominous of storm but curiosity interest and a sense that even a prime minister should have fair play prevailed his rich tones and clear articulation—and mr gladstone had studied all the arts for husbanding vocal resources—carried his words beyond the five or six thousand persons that are commonly understood to be the limit of possible hearers in the open air after half an hour of struggle he conquered a hold upon them that became more intense as he went on—touching topic after topic defending all that had been done for the reform and efficiency of the army denouncing extreme opinions on the education act vindicating the ballot bill laughing at various prescriptions of social quackery—until at the close of a speech nearly two hours long he retired amid sustained hurricanes of earnest applause well might he speak of rather an excess of physical effort to say nothing of effort of mind  on his return to hawarden he had a visit from mr bright whom he earnestly hoped to bring back into the cabinet250       nov 13—hawarden two long conversations with mr bright who     arrived at one 14—some five hours in conversation with mr     bright also i opened my proposal to him which he took kindly     though cautiously my conversation with him yesterday evening kept     me awake till four a most rare event but my brain assumes in the     evening a feminine susceptibility and resents any unusual strain     though strange to say it will stand a debate in the h of c     15—forenoon with bright who departed having charmed everybody     by his gentleness began the cutting of a large beech       to lord granville      nov 15 1871—bright has been here for fortyeight hours of     which we passed i think more than a fourth in conversation on     public affairs everything in and everything out of the cabinet i     told him as far as my memory would serve and i think we pretty     well boxed the political compass on the whole i remained     convinced of two things first that his heart is still altogether     with us secondly that his health though requiring great care     is really equal to the moderate demands we should make upon him     the truth is i was quite as much knocked up with our conversation     as he was but then i had the more active share in the whole     range of subjects that we travelled over we came to no point of     sharp difference and i feel confident that he could work with the     cabinet as harmoniously and effectually as before in saying this     i should add that i told him with respect to economy that i     thought we should now set our faces in that direction i told him     that we should not expect of him ordinary night attendance in the     house of commons and that his attendance in the cabinet was the     main object of our desire he was pleased and touched with our     desire and he has not rejected the proposal he has intimated     doubts and apprehensions but he reserves it for consideration     and seemed decidedly pleased to learn that the question might be     held open until the meeting of parliament in case of need i     did not think it fair to put to him the request by which i     endeavoured to hold him in december 1868 viz that he would not     determine in the matter without seeing me again but i begged and     pressed that he should in no case refuse without taking the     opinion of a firstrate london physician as these are the people     whose wide experience best enables them to judge in such cases     altogether my experience of him was extremely pleasant and he was     popular beyond measure in the house where the guests were one or     two ladies and four gentlemen sir g prevost a high church but     most excellent archdeacon john murray the tory publisher and     hayward—whom to describe it needs not one and all were charmed     with bright in his character the mellowing process has continued     to advance and whatever he may have been thirty years ago he is     now a gentle and tender being yesterday he had five hours of     conversation with me and much with others also an hour and a half     walk in the rain which seemed to do him no harm whatever i will     add but one word he was deeply impressed with the royalty     question details i will report to the cabinet   mr bright did not yet feel able to return and an important year the third of the administration drew to its close    ii   two stubborn and noisy scuffles arose in the autumn of 1871 in consequence of a couple of appointments to which mr gladstone as prime minister was a party one was judicial the other was ecclesiastical  m125 parliament authorising the appointment of four paid members of the judicial committee of the privy council had restricted the post to persons who held at the date of their appointment or had previously held judicial office in this country or in india251 difficulty arose in finding a fourth member of the new court from the english bench the appointment being a new one fell to the prime minister but he was naturally guided by the chancellor the office was first offered by mr gladstone to lord penzance who declined to move application was then made to willes and to bramwell they also declined on the ground that no provision was made for their clerks willes could not abandon one who had been “his officer he might say friend for thirty years” bramwell spoke of the pecuniary sacrifice that the post would involve “for i cannot let my clerks who between them have been with me near half a century suffer by the change” the chancellor mentioned to mr gladstone a rumour that there was ’an actual strike among the judges’ in the matter nobody who knew bramwell would impute unreasonable or lowminded motives to him and from their own point of view the judges had a sort of case it was ascertained by the chancellor that blackburn and martin had said expressly that they should decline mr gladstone felt as he told lord hatherley that “it was not right to hawk the appointment about” and he offered it to sir robert collier then attorneygeneral collier’s claim to the bench and even to the headship of a court was undisputed his judicial capacity was never at any time impugned he acquired no additional emolument in accepting mr gladstone’s offer oct 1871 he reminded him “you are aware that in order to qualify me it will be necessary first to make me a common law judge” three days later the chancellor told mr gladstone “it would hardly do to place the attorneygeneral on the common law bench and then promote him” still under the circumstances he thought it would be best to follow the offer up and collier was accordingly made a judge in the common pleas sat for a few days and then went on to the judicial committee the proceeding was not taken without cabinet authority for lord granville writes to mr gladstone “nov 12 ’71 the cabinet completely assented to the arrangement sufficient attention was perhaps not given to the technical point for technical it only is i think you said at the cabinet that collier wished to have three months’ tenure of the judgeship and that we agreed with you that this would have been only a sham”  cockburn the chief justice of the queen’s bench opened fire on mr gladstone nov 10 in a long letter of rather overheroic eloquence protesting that a colourable appointment to a judgeship for the purpose of getting round the law seriously compromised the dignity of the judicial office and denouncing the grievous impropriety of the proceeding as a mere subterfuge and evasion of the statute mr gladstone could be extremely summary when he chose and he replied in three or four lines informing the chief justice that as the transaction was a joint one and as “the completed part of it to which you have taken objection was the official act of the lord chancellor” he had transmitted the letter for his consideration that was all he said the chancellor for his part contented himself with half a dozen sentences that his appointment of collier to the puisne judgeship had been made with a full knowledge of mr gladstone’s intention to recommend him for the judicial committee that he thus “acted advisedly and with the conviction that the arrangement was justified as regards both its fitness and its legality” and that he took upon himself the responsibility of thus concurring with mr gladstone and was prepared to vindicate the course pursued this curt treatment of his juniuslike composition mortified cockburn’s literary vanity and no vanity is so easily stung as that of the amateur  m126 collier when the storm was brewing at once wrote to mr gladstone nov 13 proposing to retain his judgeship to the end of the term then to resign it and act gratuitously in the privy council he begged that it might not be supposed he offered to do this merely as matter of form “though i consider the objection to my appointment wholly baseless still it is not pleasant to me to hold a salaried office my right to which is questioned” “i have received your letter” mr gladstone replied nov 14 “which contains the offer that would only be made by a highspirited man impatient of suspicion or reproval and determined to place himself beyond it i have not a grain of inclination to recede from the course marked out and if you had proposed to abandon the appointment i should have remonstrated”  what mr gladstone called “a parliamentary peppering” followed in due course it was contended that the statute in spirit as in letter exacted judicial experience and that formal passing through a court was a breach of faith with parliament as usual lawyers of equal eminence were found to contend with equal confidence that a fraud had been put upon the law and that no fraud had been put upon it that the law required judicial status not experience and on the other hand that what it required was experience not status lord hatherley and roundell palmer were all the virtues whether public or private personified they were at the top of the legal ladder and they agreed in palmer’s deliberate judgment that—after other judges with special fitness had declined the terms offered by parliament—in nominating the best man at the bar who was willing to take a vacant puisne judgeship upon the understanding that he should be at once transferred to the judicial committee the government were innocent of any offence against either the spirit or substance of the law252  yet the escape was narrow the government only missed censure in the lords by a majority of one in the commons the evening was anxious “you will see” says mr bruce feb 20 1872 “that we got but a small majority last night the fact is that our victory in the lords made men slack about coming to town and glyn got very nervous in the course of the evening however palmer’s and gladstone’s speeches both of which were excellent improved the feeling and many who had announced their intention to go away without voting remained to support us” at one moment it even looked as if the speaker might have to give a casting vote and he had framed it on these lines “i have concluded that the house while it looks upon the course taken by government as impolitic and injudicious is not prepared at the present juncture to visit their conduct with direct parliamentary censure”253 in the end ministers had a majority of twentyseven and reached their homes at three in the morning with reasonably light hearts    iii   m127 the ecclesiastical case of complaint against mr gladstone was of a similar sort by an act of parliament passed in 1871 the queen was entitled to present to the rectory of ewelme but only a person who was a member of convocation of the university of oxford this limitation was inserted by way of compensation to the university for the severance of the advowson of the rectory from a certain chair of divinity the living fell vacant and the prime minister offered it june 15 to jelf of christ church a tory and an evangelical by jelf it was declined among other names on the list for preferment was that of mr harvey a learned man who had published an edition of irenæus a work on the history and theology of the three creeds articles on judaism jansenism and jesuitism and other productions of merit as might perhaps have been surmised from the nature of his favourite pursuits he was not a liberal in politics and he had what was for the purposes of this preferment the further misfortune of being a cambridge man to him mr gladstone now offered ewelme having been advised that by the process of formal incorporation in the oxford convocation the requirement of the statute would be satisfied mr harvey accepted he was told that it was necessary that he should become a member of convocation before he could be appointed a little later aug 1 he confessed to the prime minister his misgivings lest he should be considered as an “interloper in succeeding to the piece of preferment that parliament had appropriated to bonafide members of the university of oxford” these scruples were set aside he was incorporated as a member of oriel in due form and after fortytwo days of residence was admitted to membership of convocation but whether to such plenary membership as the ewelme statute was taken to require became matter of dispute all went forward and the excellent man was presented and instituted to his rectory in regular course there was no secret about operations at oxford the oriel men were aware of his motive in seeking incorporation and the vicechancellor and everybody else concerned knew all about it mr gladstone when squalls began to blow wrote to mr harvey feb 26 ’72 that he was advised that the presentation was perfectly valid  the attack in parliament was as such attacks almost always are much overdone mr gladstone it appeared was far worse than oliver cromwell and the parliament of the great rebellion for though those bad men forced three professors upon oxford between 1648 and 1660 still they took care that the intruders should all be men trained at oxford and graduates of oxford who could be sure that the prime minister would not next appoint an ultramontane divine from bologna or a greek from corfu such extravagances did as little harm as the false stories about mr harvey being jobbed into the living because he had been at eton with mr gladstone and was his political supporter as it happened he was a conservative and mr gladstone knew nothing of him except that a number of most competent persons had praised his learning in spite of all this however and of the technical validity of the appointment we may wish that the rector’s doubts had not been overruled a worthy member regaled the house by a story of a gentleman staying in the mansion of a friend one morning he heard great noise and confusion in the yard looking out he saw a kitchenmaid being put on a horse and so carried round and round the yard when he went downstairs he asked what was the matter and the groom said “oh sir ’tis only that we’re going to take the animal to the fair to sell and we want to say he has carried a lady” the apologue was not delicate but it conveyed a common impression “gladstone spoke” says mr bruce march 9 1872 “with great vigour and eloquence on the ewelme case but i think that with the best possible intentions he had placed himself in a wrong position”    iv   in 1872 the wide popularity of the government underwent a marked decline the award at geneva caused lively irritation the most active nonconformists were in active revolt the licensing bills infuriated the most powerful of all trade interests the collier case and the ewelme case seemed superfluous and provoking blunders a strong military section thirsted for revenge on the royal warrant mr goschen’s threatened bill on local rating spread vague terrors individual ministers began to excite particular odium  as time went on the essentially composite character of a majority that was only held together by mr gladstone’s personality his authority in the house and his enormous strength outside revealed itself in awkward fissures the majority was described by good critics of the time as made up of three sections almost well defined enough to deserve the name of three separate parties first were the whigs who never forgot that the prime minister had been for half his life a tory who always suspected him and felt no personal attachment to him though they valued his respect for property and tradition and knew in any case that he was the only possible man then came the middleclass liberals who had held predominance since 1832 who were captivated by mr gladstone’s genius for finance and business and who revered his high moral ideals third there was the left wing not strong in parliament but with a certain backing among the workmen who thought their leader too fond of the church too deferential to the aristocracy and not plain enough and thorough enough for a reforming age the murmurs and suspicions of these hard and logical utilitarians of the left galled mr gladstone as ungrateful phillimore records of him at this moment—       feb 21 1872—gladstone in high spirits and in rather a     conservative mood 29—gladstone sees that the time is fast coming     when he must sever himself from his extreme supporters he means     to take the opportunity of retiring on the fair plea that he does     not like to oppose those who have shown such great confidence in     him or to join their and his opponents the plea seems good for     retirement but not for refraining in his individual capacity from     supporting a government which is liberal and conservative   here is a sketch from the aberdare papers of the temper and proceedings of the session—       april 19—we have had a disastrous week—three defeats of which     much the least damaging was that on local taxation where we     defended the public purse against a dangerous raid there is no     immediate danger to be apprehended from them but these defeats     lower prestige encourage the discontented and envious and     animate the opposition i think that gladstone who behaved     yesterday with consummate judgment and temper is personally very     indifferent at the result he is vexed at the ingratitude of men     for whom he has done such great things which would have been     simply impossible without him and would not be unwilling to leave     them for a while to their own guidance and his feeling is shared     by many of the ministry our measures must for the most part be     taken up by our successors and we should of course be too happy     to help them but i don’t see the end near although of course     everybody is speculating   yet business was done progress of a certain kind was made in the thorny field of the better regulation of public houses but mr gladstone seems never to have spoken upon it in parliament the subject was in the hands of mr bruce the home secretary an accomplished and amiable man of the purest public spirit and he passed his bill but nothing did more to bring himself and his colleagues into stern disfavour among the especially pagan strata of the population an entry or two from mr bruce’s papers will suffice to show mr gladstone’s attitude—       home office dec 9 1869—i am just returned from the cabinet     where my licensing bill went through with flying colours i was     questioned a great deal as to details but was ready and i think     that gladstone was very well pleased      jan 16 1871—i called upon gladstone yesterday evening he was     in high spirits and full of kindness he said that he had told     cardwell that i must be at the bottom of the abuse the press was     pouring upon him as i had contrived to relieve myself of it     “some one minister” he added “is sure to be assailed you caught     it in the autumn and now poor cardwell is having a hard time of     it” i went with him afterwards to the chapel royal which he     never fails to attend      dec 14—we have a cabinet today when i hope to have my     licensing bill in its main principles definitely settled     unfortunately gladstone cares for nothing but “free trade” in the     sale of liquor which the house won’t have and i cannot get him     really to interest himself in the subject   this is speaker brand’s account of the general position—       throughout the session the opposition ably led by disraeli were     in an attitude of watchfulness he kept his eye on the proceedings     of the government day by day on the alabama treaty had that     treaty failed no doubt disraeli would have taken the sense of the     house on the conduct of the government for the larger part of the     session the alabama question hung like a cloud over the     proceedings but as soon as that was settled the sky cleared it     has been a good working session of the two leading men     gladstone and disraeli neither has a strong hold on his     followers the radicals below the right gangway are turbulent and     disaffected and the same may be said of the independent     obstruction below the left gangway b e h l avowedly     obstruct all legislation and thus bring the house into discredit   m128 it was now that mr disraeli discerned the first great opportunity approaching and he took the field at manchester april 3 he drew the famous picture of the government one of the few classic pieces of the oratory of the century—       extravagance is being substituted for energy by the government     the unnatural stimulus is subsiding their paroxysms end in     prostration some take refuge in melancholy and their eminent     chief alternates between a menace and a sigh as i sit opposite     the treasury bench the ministers remind me of one of those marine     landscapes not very unusual on the coasts of south america you     behold a range of exhausted volcanoes not a flame flickers upon a     single pallid crest but the situation is still dangerous there     are occasional earthquakes and ever and anon the dark rumblings     of the sea   on midsummer day he essayed at the crystal palace a higher flight and first struck the imperialist note he agreed that distant colonies could only have their affairs administered by selfgovernment “selfgovernment when it was conceded ought to have been conceded as part of a great policy of imperial consolidation it ought to have been accomplished by an imperial tariff by securities for the people of england for the enjoyment of the unappropriated lands which belonged to the sovereign as their trustee and by a military code which should have precisely defined the means and the responsibilities by which the colonies should have been defended and by which if necessary this country should call for aid from the colonies themselves it ought further to have been accompanied by the institution of some representative council in the metropolis which would have brought the colonies into constant and continuous relations with the home government” he confessed that he had himself at one time been so far caught by the subtle views of the disintegrationists that he thought the tie was broken opinion in the country was at last rising against disintegration the people had decided that the empire should not be destroyed “in my judgment” he said “no minister in this country will do his duty who neglects any opportunity of reconstructing as much as possible our colonial empire and of responding to those distant sympathies which may become the source of incalculable strength and happiness to this land” toryism now sought three great objects “the maintenance of our institutions the preservation of our empire and the improvement of the condition of the people” the time was at hand when england would have to decide between national and cosmopolitan principles and the issue was no mean one “you must remember” he concluded “that in fighting against liberalism or the continental system you are fighting against those who have the advantage of power—against those who have been high in place for nearly half a century you have nothing to trust to but your own energy and the sublime instinct of an ancient people”  disraeli’s genius at once brooding over conceptions and penetrating in discernment of fact had shown him the vast tory reserves that his household suffrage of 1867 would rally to his flag the same genius again scanning the skies read aright the signs and characteristics of the time nobody would seriously have counselled intervention in arms between france and germany yet many felt a vague humiliation at a resettlement of europe without england nobody seriously objected to the opening of the black sea yet many were affected by a restive consciousness of diplomatic defeat everybody was glad that—as i am about to describe in the following chapter—we had settled the outstanding quarrel with america yet most people were sore at the audacity of the indirect claims followed by the award of swingeing damages national pride in short was silently but deeply stirred the steady splendour of the economic era for a season paled in uncalculating minds this coming mood the tory leader with his rare faculty of wide and sweeping forecast confidently divined and he found for it the oracle of a party cry in phrases about empire and social reform when power fell into his hands he made no single move of solid effect for either social reform or imperial unity when mr gladstone committed himself to a policy he brought in bills to carry it out forecast without a bill is interesting but not to be trusted     chapter ix washington and geneva 18701872       although i may think the sentence was harsh in its extent and     unjust in its basis i regard the fine imposed on this country as     dust in the balance compared with the moral value of the example     set when these two great nations of england and america—which are     among the most fiery and the most jealous in the world with regard     to anything that touches national honour—went in peace and concord     before a judicial tribunal rather than resort to the arbitrament     of the sword—gladstone254    i   one morning in the summer of 1862 a small wooden sloop screw and steam of a little over a thousand tons register dropped slowly down the waters of the mersey the decks were rough and unfinished but guests on board with bright costumes made a gay picture flags were flying and all wore the look of a holiday trial trip after luncheon in the cabin the scene suddenly changed at a signal from the vessel a tug came alongside the cheerful visitors to their surprise were quickly transferred and the sloop made off upon her real business she dropped anchor in a bay on the coast of anglesey where she took twenty or thirty men mostly english on board from a tug sent after her from liverpool with or without the knowledge of the officials thence she sailed to the azores where a steamer from london and a steamer from liverpool brought officers armaments and coal as soon as these were transshipped the british ensign was hauled down the confederate flag run up and the captain opened sealed orders directing him to sink burn or destroy everything that flew the ensign of the socalled united states of america these orders the captain of the rover faithfully executed and in a few months the alabama—for that was henceforth her memorable name—had done much to sweep the commercial marine of america from the ocean  m129 on the day on which she sailed july 29 the government made up its mind that she should be detained on the strength of affidavits that had been almost a week in their hands the bird of prey had flown the best definition of due diligence in these matters would seem to be that it is the same diligence and exactness as are exercised in proceedings relating to imposts of excise or customs we may guess how different would have been the vigilance of the authorities if a great smuggling operation had been suspected this lamentable proceeding for which the want of alacrity and common sense at the foreign office and the bias or blundering of the customs agents at liverpool may divide the grave discredit opened a diplomatic campaign between england and the united states that lasted as long as the siege of troy and became an active element in the state of moral war that prevailed during that time between the two kindred communities mr gladstone like other members of the palmerston administration held for several years that the escape of the alabama was no wrong done by us lord russell admitted 1863 that the cases of the alabama and the oreto were “a scandal and in some degree a reproach to our laws” though he stated in the same sentence that the cabinet thought the law sufficient where legal evidence also was sufficient it was true that britain is the greatest shipbuilding country in the world that to interfere with ships or any other article of commerce is in so far to impose on a neutral some of the calamities of a belligerent and that restriction of trade was no element in the policy and spirit of foreign enlistment acts either here or in america which was the first country that by positive legislation sought to restrain its citizens within definite limits of neutrality by a law of this kind parliament intended to forbid all subjects within its jurisdiction to make war on people at peace with the british sovereign it is only in the words of canning when the elements of armament are combined that they come within the purview of such law this is not by way of controversy but to define an issue chief justice cockburn an ardent champion of his country if ever there was one pronounced in his judgment at geneva when the day for a verdict at length arrived that the cruiser ought to have been detained a week before that the officials of customs were misled by legal advice “perhaps erroneous” and that the right course to take was “plain and unmistakable” even lord russell after many years of obdurate selfdefence at last confessed in manly words “i assent entirely to the opinion of the lord chief justice that the alabama ought to have been detained during the four days i was waiting for the opinion of the law officers but i think that the fault was not that of the commissioners of customs it was my fault as secretary of state for foreign affairs”255  before the alabama some ten vessels intended for confederate service had been detained inquired into and if released released by order of a court for want of evidence after the alabama no vessel on which the american minister had made representation to the foreign office succeeded in quitting a british port but critical cases occurred emboldened by the successful escape of the alabama the confederate agents placed two ironclad rams upon the stocks at the birkenhead shipyard mr adams the american minister in london renewed his bombardment of the foreign office with proof of their object and design the foreign office repeated its perplexed pleas against interference made still more difficult by a colourable transfer of the rams to a french owner and the whole dreary tragicomedy of the alabama seemed likely to be acted over again by the autumn of 1863 the rams were ready to take the water and the builders were again talking of a trial trip this time lord russell gave orders that the rams were to be stopped sept 3 he felt the mortification of an honourable man at the trick of which he had allowed himself to be made the dupe in the case of the alabama perhaps also he had been impressed by language used by mr adams to a member of the cabinet and more formally to himself to the effect that the departure of the rams would mean the practical opening to the southern confederates of full liberty to use this country as a base for hostile expeditions against the north “this” said mr adams “is war”256  the affair of the rams was followed by mr gladstone with absorbed attention he confessed to the duke of argyll sept 30 1863 that he could not get the ironclads out of his head and his letter shows with what exhaustive closeness he argued the case the predicament was exactly fitted to draw out some of his most characteristic qualities—minute precision infinite acuteness infinite caution the faculty of multiplied distinction upon distinction an eye for the shadows of a shade the points are no longer of living interest but they exhibit a side of him that is less visible in his broader performances of parliament or platform  as might have been expected mr adams was instructed to solicit redress for the doings of the alabama lord russell dec 19 1862 declaring that government had used every effort to stop her refused to admit that we were under any obligation whatever to make compensation two years later aug 30 1865 he still declined both compensation and a proposal for arbitration this opened a long struggle of extreme interest in the ministerial life of mr gladstone and what was more in the history of civilised nations it was arbitration upon these issues that now began to divide politicians both inside the cabinet and outside just as mediation and recognition had divided them in the earlier stages of the american conflict  m130 in 1863 mr adams was the first to point to what after a long struggle became the solution of these difficulties by assuring lord russell that there was “no fair and equitable form of conventional arbitrament or reference” to which america would not be willing to submit in 1865 sept 2 mr gladstone wrote a letter to lord russell the reply to which has already been published257 always jealous for cabinet authority he began by submitting to lord russell that he had no idea that a despatch refusing arbitration was to be written without a cabinet being held upon a subject so important as it was they had not disposed of the question or even discussed it on the merits he inclined to believe that the demand for arbitration was highly unreasonable still though not disposed to say “yes” to the demand he doubted “no” the proper course would be to lead the americans to bring out the whole of their case so that the cabinet might have all the pleas before them previously to coming to “a decision of great delicacy and moment”  lord russell stood to his guns “the question” he said “has been the principal object of my thoughts for the last two years and i confess i think that paying twenty millions down would be far preferable to submitting the case to arbitration” england would be disgraced for ever if a foreign government were left to arbitrate whether an english secretary of state had been diligent or negligent in his duties and whether an english law officer was partial and prejudiced in giving his opinion of english law there the matter stood and the moral war smouldered on    ii   in 1870 the time arrived when mr gladstone himself no longer a minister third in standing in a palmerston government was called upon to deal with this great issue as a principal in his own administration in 1868 the conservative government had agreed to a convention by which a mixed commission british and american sitting in london should decide upon the settlement of all claims by the subjects of either country upon the other and in respect of what were known generically as the alabama claims proposing to refer these to the arbitration of the head of some friendly state in case the mixed commission should not agree the idea of a composite court or tribunal as distinguished from a single sovereign arbitrator had not yet risen above the horizon before this project ripened mr disraeli was out of government lord clarendon had taken lord stanley’s place at the foreign office and the convention with some modifications was signed by him jan 14 1869 and in due course despatched to washington there the senate not on the merits but for party and personal reasons refused to ratify though this attempt failed neither of the two english political parties was in a position any longer to refuse arbitration in principle  agreement in principle is of little avail without driving force enough for practice the driving force was found mainly from a gradual change in english sentiment though the difficulties with russia also counted for something even so early as 1863 the tide of popular opinion in england had begun slowly to swell in favour of the northern cause in 1866 victory across the atlantic was decided the union was saved and slavery was gone a desire to remove causes of difference between ourselves and the united states grew at a remarkable speed for the spectacle of success is wont to have magical effects even in minds that would indignantly reject the standards of machiavelli while benevolent feeling gained volume in this country statesmen in america took ground that made the satisfaction of it harder they began to base their claim for reparation on the original proclamation of british neutrality when the american conflict began first made in 1866 this new pretension was repeated in despatches of 1867 and in 1869 the american secretary formally recorded the complaint that the southern insurrection obtained its enduring vitality by resources drawn from england and as a consequence of england’s imperfect discharge of her duties as neutral england became they said the arsenal the navyyard and the treasury of the insurgent confederacy  in the discussion of the clarendon convention of 1869 mr sumner—a man of some great qualities but too often the slave of words where he thought himself their master—made an extravagant speech against the british government in the senate assessing the claim of the united states upon this country on principles that would have raised it to the modest figure of some four hundred million pounds sterling due from us to them or as mr gladstone himself estimated it to sixteen hundred millions it does not matter which this was only a violent and fantastic exaggeration of an idea of constructive claims for indirect damages that lay slumbering but by no means extinct in american minds until as we shall see in 1872 it very nearly led to a disastrous explosion this idea first found distinct and official utterance in the despatch of 1869 besides compensating individuals for depredations we were to pay for the cost to america of chasing the cruisers for the transfer of most of the american commercial marine to the british flag for enhanced insurance and generally for the increased difficulty of putting down the rebellion  all through 1870 a rather troublesome exchange of letters went on between washington and the foreign office and mr gladstone took an active concern in it “i grieve to trouble you with so much manuscript” lord clarendon writes him on one occasion mar 17 1870 “but i don’t venture singlehanded to conduct a correspondence with the united states all this correspondence can do nothing but harm and i have made my answer as short as is consistent with courtesy i should like to send it on saturday but if you have not time to look at it or think it ought to be seen by the cabinet i could make an excuse for the delay to motley” all this was in entire conformity to mr gladstone’s enduring conception of the right relations between a prime minister and the foreign secretary we need not follow details but one must not be omitted in 1868 a royal commission recommended various material changes in the foreign enlistment act and in 1870 accordingly a new law was passed greatly strengthening the hands of the executive and furnishing due means of selfprotection against such nefarious manœuvres as those of the alabama258 by this act among other things it was made an offence to build a ship with reasonable cause to believe that it would be employed in the service of a foreign state at war with a friendly state  as the year 1870 went on the expediency of an accommodation with america strengthened in mr gladstone’s mind one member of the cabinet pointed out to the foreign secretary that if there was any chance of a war with russia about the black sea it would be as well to get causes of differences with america out of the way otherwise however unprepared the united states might be at the moment we should undoubtedly have them on our hands sooner or later259 with mr gladstone the desire was not a consequence of the possible troubles with russia his view was wider and less specific he was alive to the extent to which england’s power in europe was reduced by the smothered quarrel with america but he took even higher ground than this in his sense of the blessing to the world of an absolute reconciliation in good faith between the old england and the new at first the government proposed nov 28 1870 to send over sir john rose to america he was one of the many scots who have carried the british flag in its best colours over the face of the globe his qualities had raised him to great prominence in canada he had enjoyed good opportunities of measuring the american ground he was shrewd wise well read in the ways of men and the book of the world and he had besides the virtue of being pleasant rose himself did not formally undertake the mission but he applied himself with diligence and success to bring the american government to the project of a joint high commission to examine and consider a situation that there was a common desire to terminate  m131 on feb 1 1871 mr gladstone was able to report to the queen the arrival of news that the government of the united states were willing to concur in a commission for the discussion of international questions at present depending without a previous understanding that liability in respect of the alabama was to be acknowledged by this country the cabinet naturally thought that on this they might close and they at once considered the composition of the commission and the proper instructions lord de grey consented to be its president lord derby on being invited to join the commission was very grateful for the compliment but declined being of opinion that firmness and not concession to the americans was what was wanted sir george grey declined so did lord halifax “i asked northcote” lord granville reports to mr gladstone “his eyes twinkled through his spectacles but he said he must ask lady northcote and requested permission to consult dizzy the former consented ditto dizzy which looks well” so the commission was made up of lord de grey as the head of it northcote thornton the british minister at washington sir john macdonald as the representative of canada and mr mountague bernard a theoretic jurist who had written a book about our neutrality the year before260    iii   the personal relations of lord de grey and his brethren with their american colleagues were excellent they worked hard all day and enjoyed washington hospitality in its full strength every night in business mr fish occasionally advanced or supported contentions thought by the englishmen to be almost amusing for instance mr sumner in a memorandum jan 17 1871 to mr fish had submitted a singular species of political syllogism he desired nothing so much he said as that entire goodwill should prevail between great britain and the united states and that the settlement should be complete now the greatest trouble and peril in the way of a complete settlement was fenianism fenianism was excited by the proximity of the british flag over the canadian border therefore the british flag should be withdrawn from the whole hemisphere including the islands and the american flag should fly in its stead in conformity with this tight and simple chain of reasoning mr fish threw out a hint to lord de grey that the cession of canada might end the quarrel the english envoy contented himself with the dry remark that he did not find such a suggestion in his instructions261  though sometimes amused the commissioners soon understood that at heart the american negotiators desired to settle difficulties with their own people were great a presidential campaign with all its necessities approached a settlement of outstanding accounts with england might be a good card to play in the election on the other hand if the peace card were not available it was just possible that a war card might do nearly as well mr fish was mortally afraid of sumner who had been chairman of the foreign relations committee in the senate and whose antienglish temper as we have seen was redhot the constitutional requirement of a twothirds majority in the senate for the ratification of a treaty was awkward and menacing and it was necessary to secure dubious senators by the exhibition of high national temper on the public stage it is interesting to note in passing that the english visitors were persuaded how much better it would have been if according to our own parliamentary system at westminster the american system had allowed mr fish to meet mr sumner on the floor of congress and instead of seeking victory by unseen manipulation fight the battle out before the country  m132 the british commissioners were almost as much embarrassed by their friends at home as by their friends or foes at washington both ministers and lawyers from the safe distance of downing street were sometimes excessive in pressing small and trivial alterations which the americans after the diplomatist’s manner insisted on treating as if they were not small but great the sharp corner in the london cabinet was the more serious proposal that certain rules as to the duty of neutrals should be laid down and should be made guiding principles for the arbitrators although the rules themselves had not been formally established when england’s alleged breaches of neutral obligation had been committed this retroactive or expostfacto quality when the cabinet considered it march 18 gave trouble and it was used by passionate and impolitic persons to tarnish the whole policy in this country much heat was evoked for a cabinet of many talents is not always the same thing as a cabinet of plain minds one clever man objected at large to the commission to concession to obtaining any principle of settlement for future contingencies a second was violent against all such arbitration as this and thought they had much better pay up at once and have done with it a third clever man even let fall some high words about “national dishonour” granville argyll forster the last described by a colleague as “a tower of strength” were steadfast and unfaltering for conciliation mr gladstone agreed but eager though he was for a settlement he “agreed with reluctance” sir roundell palmer had now great influence with him and palmer had come round to the conclusion that the risk from translating retrospectively into the form of a hypothetical international convention not existing when the events happened a duty that we had recognised as incumbent on us under our own law might be safely run262 in plain english the adverse way of describing this peculiar substitute for a free and open arbitration was that great britain owed the americans nothing and if she had not consented to accept a set of newfangled rules and to be judged retroactively by them she could not possibly have been made to pay anything to this the short answer was that though the rules might or might not be newfangled as principles of international law yet they were not new as principles of english municipal law which as construed by the british government itself was coincident in substance with those rules was it in fact reasonable to contend that ironclads might be built in the mersey sent out a few miles beyond the river mouth there armed from lighters and sent off to bombard new york if not was it reasonable that england should invite the arbitrators to judge the alabama case according to one rule in the past and then to lay down another rule for the future  a minor objection raised by mr gladstone gave much alarm to his commissioners and it is too characteristic to be omitted speaking of the ardently desired treaty he writes to lord granville april 12 1871—       with regard to the preamble it designates the late war in america     as “the rebellion” i do not think it is right for us now to adopt     a mode of speech different from that which we maintained     throughout the struggle further it tends to discredit our     recognition of belligerency and if we declare it a rebellion we     have given an example available to be quoted hereafter for the     dealings of a foreign power with rebels as belligerents if on     the other hand the americans object to speaking of the “civil     war” it is quite easy so i think to leave out the words “during     the recent rebellion in the us” altogether and to say in the     years 186—or even to begin “whereas hbm” perhaps inserting in     after “us” “in respect of such depredations”   this is an instance of the tenacity with which he sometimes held his ground after its relations and bearings had entirely changed something too may doubtless be set down to the lingering remains of his old feeling of the strength of the constitutional argument of the south that sovereign states had a right to withdraw from the union if they pleased if the proposal to drop the word “rebellion” had been brought without warning or preparation before the full commission assent would have been hopeless but by the discretion of informal interviews the matter was canvassed beforehand the obnoxious word was silently left out mr gladstone’s point was gained and things went prosperously forward “i am quite sure” wrote sir stafford northcote to mr gladstone march 17 “that there was no other way in which you could have hoped to settle these questions than by such a commission as ours what may be our fate i do not presume to guess but if we succeed it will be mainly due to de grey’s excellent sense tact and temper” in the end notwithstanding the power of the senate over treaties the want of control by the american government over its party and the exigencies of canada all at last fell into decent shape and the substantial objects in view were effectively maintained canadian fishery questions were adjusted and the boundary of san juan remitted to the arbitration of the newly made german emperor  m133 after thirtyseven sittings spread over a period of two months the treaty was signed on may 8 in a room decorated with flowers with the good omen of brilliant sunshine and everybody in such good humour that the american secretary of the commission tossed up with lord tenterden which should sign first—the englishman happily winning the treaty began by the declaration that her britannic majesty authorised the commissioners to express in a friendly spirit the regret felt by her majesty’s government for the escape under whatever circumstances of the alabama and other vessels from british ports and for the depredations committed by these vessels it embraced a definition of the rules of maritime neutrality which some legal textwriters have applauded and other legal textwriters have therefore condemned finally and most important of all whether we look at the immediate purpose or at its contribution to a great though slowmoving cause the treaty of washington secured a judgment by the arbitration of a tribunal of all claims growing out of acts committed by the cruisers “and generically known as the alabama claims” the tribunal was to consist of five members named by great britain the united states switzerland italy and brazil  the effect of the rules of washington as applied at geneva remains as i have said a topic of controversy maine for example while admitting that the result for the occasion was good holds that by making the rule of neutral duty more severe it marked reaction rather than progress in the general drift of international law263 others maintain that the amended foreign enlistment act of 1870 which is in fact a partial incorporation of the washington rules went far beyond what international law requires and made a new crime out of an act namely the building of a ship which is not forbidden either by the law of nations or by other municipal laws264    iv   m134 once after some crowning mercy in the war president lincoln said to his cabinet “now gentlemen we have got our harpoon into the monster but we must still take uncommon care or else by a single flop of his tail he will send us into all eternity” this wholesome caution too often overlooked by headlong politicians was suddenly found to be much needed at the eleventh hour of the treaty of washington at the end of 1871 mr gladstone experienced a severe shock for he found that the case put in by america for the arbitrators insisted upon an adjudication by them not only upon the losses suffered by individual american citizens but upon the indirect constructive consequential and national claims first propounded in their full dimensions by mr sumner a storm at once arose in england and nobody was more incensed than the prime minister in reporting to the queen he used language of extreme vehemence and in the house of commons feb 9 1872 when mr disraeli spoke of the indirect claims as preposterous and wild as nothing less than the exacting of tribute from a conquered people mr gladstone declared that such words were in truth rather under the mark than an exaggeration and went on to say that “we must be insane to accede to demands which no nation with a spark of honour or spirit left could submit to even at the point of death” speaking of the construction put upon the treaty by the government he declared such a construction to be “the true and unambiguous meaning of the words and therefore the only meaning admissible whether tried by grammar by reason by policy or by any other standard” some persons argued that this was to accuse the americans of dishonesty “i learn really for the first time” exclaimed mr gladstone to lord granville feb 8 “that a man who affirms that in his opinion a document is unambiguous in his favour thereby affirms that one who reads it otherwise is dishonest” his critics retorted that surely a construction that could not stand the test of grammar of reason of policy or any other test must be due either to insanity or to dishonesty and as we could hardly assume general grant mr fish and the others to be out of their wits there was nothing for it but dishonesty  for five anxious months the contest lasted the difficulties were those of time and form often worse than those of matter and substance nor would this have been the first case in which small points hinder the settlement of great questions the manner of proceeding as mr gladstone reports to the queen was of such complication that hours were given almost every day for many weeks to the consideration of matter which on the day following was found to have moved out of view suggestions came from washington mostly inadmissible whether their faults were due to accident and haste or to design sometimes refusals of this suggestion or that from our side were couched in “terms of scant courtesy and bordering upon harshness” still the cabinet persisted in husbanding every chance of saving the treaty they charitably judged the attitude of the washington government in mr gladstone’s ample language “to be directed by considerations belonging to the sphere of its own domestic policy and to the contentions of party in that sphere but they will attempt by patient consideration avoidance of selflaudation and of irritating topics and a steady endeavour to be right to attain the great end in view of an honourable settlement which it would be a sad disgrace as well as misfortune to both countries now to miss” and here occurs a consideration as we pass upon the american constitution “the fact remains indisputable june 1 that there is no conclusive evidence of any serious subject the substance of which is at present in dispute between the two governments but the difficulties arising on the american side from what may be termed electioneering considerations are greatly aggravated by the position of the american senate and the reference to that body for previous counsel for which it seems to be miserably unsuited as it takes days and almost weeks for debate where a cabinet would require only hours”  the opposition in parliament was patriotic and as a rule made no difficulties “mr disraeli” reports mr gladstone june 3 “behaved with the caution and moderation which have generally marked his conduct with regard to the washington treaty on the whole the house of commons showed the same dignified selfcommand for which it has been remarkable during the whole period since the opening of the session with reference to this question although the more inflammatory expressions which fell from a few members were warmly cheered by a portion and a portion only of the opposition”  the cabinet was unanimous against the submission of the indirect claims but there were marked differences of leaning as in fact there had been throughout all accepted lord ripon’s265 view that if he had insisted on getting into the treaty nothing less than a formal and express repudiation of the indirect claims no treaty at all would have been possible both sides in the washington conferences had been more anxious to submit to the arbitrators the principle of allowing indirect claims than to embark on any discussion of them the american commissioners knew this principle to be unsound but knowing also that their own people expected the claims to be referred they could only abstain from insisting on their inclusion the british commissioners were willing silently to waive an express renunciation of them being confident that the terms of the protocols and the language of the treaty would be so construed by the arbitrators as to exclude the indirect claims266 all this was a rational and truly diplomatic temper on both sides but then the immortal events of a hundred years before had shown too plainly that englishmen at home cannot always be trusted to keep a rational and diplomatic temper and many events in the interval had shown that english colonists even when transfigured into american citizens were still chips of the old block the cabinet agreed that a virtual waiver of the claims was to be found both in the protocols of the conference and in the language of the treaty lord ripon and mr forster however thought it would be safe to go on at geneva in the assurance that the arbitrators would be certain to rule the indirect claims out at the other extreme of the cabinet scale the view was urged that england should not go on unless she put upon record a formal declaration that did she not and never would assent to any adjudication upon the indirect claims to a certain minister who pressed for some declaration in this sense—also formulated in a motion by lord russell in parliament himself responsible for so much of the original mischief267—mr gladstone wrote as follows—       june 17— i doubt whether the cabinet can legitimately be     asked as a cabinet to make these affirmations inasmuch as     according to my view they are not within the purview of its     present undertaking—that undertaking has reference exclusively to     the scope of the arbitration we have contended all along that the     claims would not legitimately come before the arbitrators but     we had never demanded the assent of the americans to our     reasoning only to our conclusion that the claims were not within     the scope of the arbitration it is my view but this is quite     another matter that they lie cast aside a dishonoured carcass     which no amount of force fraud or folly can again galvanise into     life you will see then in sum that if i rightly understand     you i accept for myself broadly and freely what may be called the     extreme doctrine about the indirect claims but i think the     cabinet cannot fairly be challenged for an official judgment on a     matter really not before it   the little entries in the diary give us a good idea of the pressure on the prime minister—       feb 6 1872—spoke an hour after disraeli on the address     the alabama and washington question lay heavy on me till the     evening even during the speech i was

11th—the cabinet met at 2 and sat     intermittently with the house to 5¾ again 9141   m135 the arbitrators were to meet on june 15 yet no break in the clouds seemed likely mr gladstone and his colleagues had a meeting at the foreign office and did not separate until after midnight on june 11 the british agent was to be directed to apply for an immediate adjournment and without lodging the summary of our case as provided by the treaty if the arbitrators declined to adjourn either because the americans objected or from a belief that they had no title to adjourn without a formal opening of business by lodging summaries then was or was not our agent to change tack and lodge his summary or was the arbitration and with the arbitration the whole treaty to fall to the ground for want of it on this question mr gladstone thought it his duty to mention to the queen that it had not yet june 13 been found possible to bring the cabinet to a decision for a day or two it looked as if the ministry might fall to pieces but the head of it was indomitable—       june 13 thursday—since tuesday morning i have constantly     resolved or discussed this proposition that we should not be     justified in breaking off the proceedings at geneva if an     adjournment can be had after presentation of the summary upon a     refusal to present it my determination upon it is now firmly     rooted and tested by all the mental effort i can apply and the     time i thought had come today for looking forward as well as     backward i therefore wrote to the queen in terms which might a     little prepare her for difficulties in the cabinet i saw     granville first who had not reached my point but seemed to come     up to it then arranged for him to see halifax ripon to see     kimberley and the chancellor lowe to see cardwell as the     knot of the probable difficulty is in these three on the whole     i hope we shall in one way or another work through at any     rate if anything like a government can be held together i will     not shrink      june 15—cabinet 12214 and with brief intervals to 7½     dined with princess louise after dinner granville and i went to     see mr hammond then on to the f 0 where we got before     midnight the protocol of today from geneva thank god that up to     a certain point the indications on this great controversy are     decidedly favourable      june 16—sunday bunker hill anniversary no—june 17 cabinet     here 1½314 we sent off a telegram which i hope may finish     the good work at geneva   what happened at geneva was this when the day came the british agent did not lodge his summary but asked for an adjournment for eight months as the two governments did not agree upon the scope of the arbitration this looked dark enough and the treaty seemed doomed it was saved by mr adams the american nominee on the tribunal when he reached geneva and learned how things stood he decided that the knot which they could not untie must be cut268 his golden idea was this the arbitrators should make a spontaneous declaration that on the principles of international law the indirect claims ought to be excluded from their consideration adams saw his colleagues one by one and brought them round to his view the english chief justice had made up his mind that the whole thing was dead as he had for many months been loudly telling all london that it ought to be but when asked by mr adams whether the spontaneous extrajudicial declaration would remove all obstacles to progress cockburn answered that he thought it would “i said” mr adams continued “that in that event i was prepared to make a proposition i should be assuming a heavy responsibility but i should do so not as an arbitrator representing my country but as representing all nations” so the indirect claims were summarily ruled out and the arbitration proceeded in some notes prepared for the cabinet on all these proceedings feb 4 1873 lord tenterden the clever and experienced british agent at geneva writes “i cannot conclude this part of the memorandum without saying that the dignity tact selfcommand and moderation with which mr adams discharged his functions as arbitrator did honour to his country”  m136 in september 1872 the five arbitrators at geneva gave their award they were unanimous in finding great britain liable for the acts of the alabama all save the british representative found her liable for the florida the italian the swiss and the american against the englishman and the brazilian found her liable for the shenandoah after leaving melbourne they awarded in satisfaction and final settlement of all claims including interest a gross sum of about three and a quarter million pounds sterling the award though hardly a surprise still inflicted a lively twinge of mortification on the masterful and confident people of this island opinion was divided but the decision was not one of those that cut deep or raise the public temperature to fever the prints of the opposition insisted that the result was profoundly vexatious it was a bungled settlement and the arguments used in favour of it were “wild sentimental rubbish” on the other hand the times regarded it with profound satisfaction and ministerial writers with a lyric turn hailed it as a magnificent victory though we had to pay a heavy bill a little balm was extracted from the fact that the americans had preferred before the tribunal a demand of nine millions and a half and thus got little more than onethird of what they had asked so ended what has been called the greatest of all arbitrations extinguishing the embers that could not have been left to smoulder without constant peril of a vast and fratricidal conflagration the treaty of washington and the geneva arbitration stand out as the most notable victory in the nineteenth century of the noble art of preventive diplomacy and the most signal exhibition in their history of selfcommand in two of the three chief democratic powers of the western world for the moment the result did something to impair the popularity of mr gladstone’s government but his association with this high act of national policy is one of the things that give its brightest lustre to his fame     chapter x as head of a cabinet 18681874       rational cooperation in politics would be at an end if no two     men might act together until they had satisfied themselves that     in no possible circumstances could they be divided—gladstone    i   the just complacency with which mr gladstone regarded his cabinet on its first construction held good—       i look back with great satisfaction on the internal working of the     cabinet of 186874 it was a cabinet easily handled and yet it     was the only one of my four cabinets in which there were members     who were senior to myself the lord chancellor hatherley lord     clarendon with many other men of long ministerial experience     when this cabinet was breaking up in 1874 i took the opportunity     of thanking them for the manner in which they had uniformly     lightened my task in the direction of business in reply halifax     who might be considered as the senior in years and experience     taken jointly very handsomely said the duty of the cabinet had     been made more easy by the considerate manner in which i had     always treated them some of them were as colleagues absolutely     delightful from the manner in which their natural qualities     blended with their consummate experience i refer especially to     clarendon and granville   m137 if we may trust some of those who were members of it no cabinet ever did its business with livelier industry or effect under mr gladstone’s hand it was a really working cabinet not an assemblage of departmental ministers each minding his own affairs available as casual members of this or the other subcommittee and without an eye for the general drift and tendency of their proceedings of course ministers differed in importance one was pleasant and popular but not forcible another overflowed with knowledge and was really an able man but somehow he carried no guns and nobody cared what he said one had aptitude without weight—perhaps the true definition of our grossly overworked epithet of clever another had weight and character without much aptitude the cabinet as a whole was one of extraordinary power not merely because its chief had both aptitude and momentum enough for a dozen but because it was actively homogeneous in reforming spirit and purpose this solidarity is the great element in such combinations and the mainspring of all vigorous cabinet work  of mr gladstone as head of his first cabinet we have a glimpse from mr stansfeld—       mr gladstone’s conduct in the cabinet was very curious when i     first joined in 1871 i naturally thought that his position was so     commanding that he would be able to say “this is my policy     accept it or not as you like” but he did not he was always     profuse in his expressions of respect for the cabinet there was a     wonderful combination in mr gladstone of imperiousness and of     deference in the cabinet he would assume that he was nothing i     thought he should have said “this is my policy what do you think     of it” and then have fought it out until they had come to an     agreement he always tried to lead them on by unconscious steps to     his own conclusions269   to this we may add some words of lord granville used in 1883 but doubtless just as true of 186874—       i have served under several prime ministers men for whom i had     high respect and to whom i had the greatest attachment but i can     say that i never knew one who showed a finer temper a greater     patience or more consideration for his colleagues than mr     gladstone in all deliberations on any important subject in his     official position with his knowledge with his ability and with     the wonderful power of work that characterises him he of course     has an immense influence on the deliberations of the cabinet but     notwithstanding his tenacity of purpose and his earnestness it is     quite extraordinary how he attends to the arguments of all and     except on any question of real vital principle he is ready to     yield his own opinion to the general sense of the colleagues over     whom he presides270   imputing his own qualities to others and always keen to make the best of people and not the worst if he had once invited a man to office he held on to him to the last possible moment “the next most serious thing to admitting a man into the cabinet” he said “is to leave a man out who has once been in” not seldom he carried his invincible courtesy deference and toleration even beyond the domain where those qualities ought to be supreme this was part of what men meant when they said that life was to him in all its aspects an application of christian teaching and example to this we must add another consideration of first importance and one that vulgar criticism of great statesmen too commonly ignores in the words of lord aberdeen 1856 who knew from sharp experience how much his doctrine might cost a man “a prime minister is not a free agent to break up a government to renounce all the good you hoped to do and leave imperfect all the good you have done to hand over power to persons whose objects or whose measures you disapprove even merely to alienate and politically to injure your friends is no slight matter”271  a member of this first cabinet wrote to mr gladstone long after it had come to an end “i suppose there was no one of your then colleagues less sympathetic with you less in tune with your opinions and enthusiasms than lowe nevertheless this happened to me with him—after you had resigned lowe opened to me one day on the subject of your relations with your colleagues he spoke in terms of warm admiration and to my great surprise ended by saying ‘i have the same kind of feeling towards him that i can suppose must be the feeling of a dog for his master’ lowe is a perfectly sincere man he would not have said this if he had not felt it” “in everything personal” mr gladstone replied “lowe was an excellent colleague and member of cabinet but i had never been in personal relations with him before and at the outset of the ministry of 1868 i knew very little of him moreover he was the occasion of much trouble to me by his incessant broils with —— who was an awkward customer” in sheer intellect mr gladstone held that lowe had not many equals but in nobody else did he discover so many mixed and contradictory qualities—“splendid in attack but most weak in defence at times exhibiting pluck beyond measure but at other times pusillanimity almost amounting to cowardice one day headstrong and independent and the next day helpless as a child to walk alone capable of tearing anything to pieces but of constructing nothing”272  m138 when lord clarendon died—“an irreparable colleague” mr gladstone notes in his diary “a statesman of many gifts a most lovable and genial man” elsewhere he commemorates his “unswerving loyalty his genial temper his kindness ever overflowing in acts yet more than in words his liberal and indulgent appreciation of others” in the short government of 18656 lord granville had described clarendon to mr gladstone as “excellent communicating more freely with the cabinet and carrying out their policy more faithfully than any foreign secretary i have known” mr gladstone himself told me twenty years after that of the sixty men or so who had been his colleagues in cabinet clarendon was the very easiest and most attractive it is curious to observe that with the exception of mr bright he found his most congenial adherents rather among the patrician whigs than among the men labelled as advanced  mr bright as we have seen was forced by illhealth to quit the government thirty years of unsparing toil more than ten of them devoted especially to the exhausting but in his case most fruitful labours of the platform had for the time worn down his stock of that energy of mind which in the more sinewy frame of the prime minister seemed as boundless as some great natural element to mrs bright mr gladstone wrote—       it is not merely a selfish interest that all his colleagues feel     in him on account of his great powers just fame and political     importance but it is one founded on the esteem and regard which     one and all they entertain towards him god grant that any     anxieties you may entertain about him may soon be effectually     relieved i wish i felt quite certain that he is as good a patient     as he is a colleague but the chief object of my writing was to     say that the queen has signified both by letter and telegraph her     lively interest in mr b’s health and she will not forgive me     unless i am able to send her frequent reports   he is quite capable of dealing faithfully with colleagues breaking rules to a member of the cabinet who had transgressed by absence from a division of life and death—       i should not act frankly by you if i did not state it without     hesitation as a general and prospective proposition that without     reference to the likelihood or unlikelihood of defeat upon     motions which must from their nature be votes of confidence     there can be but one rule for the members of the government and     that is to give the votes themselves which at the same time the     government with less strong title is asking from the members of     their party   he scolds a leading minister pretty directly for placing him in a disagreeable and rather ludicrous position by failing to give the proper information about a government bill containing an important change so that nobody could explain the reason for it to the house his own personal example of absolutely unremitting attendance on the scene of action entitled him to rebuke slackness nothing escaped him here is the way in which he called defaulters to their duty—       april 8 1873—the chancellor of the exchequer thinks he has     some reason to complain of your having quitted london on thursday     without any prior communication with him or glyn four days before     the budget i have heard with regret that the state of your health     has compelled you to spend your vacation abroad but scarcely even     a direct medical order and certainly in my opinion nothing less     could render such an example innocent in its effects as is set by     a departure from london under such circumstances although it has     been a great pleasure to me to admit and recognise your     parliamentary services and distinctions and though i have always     thought your accession to the government an acquisition of great     value i must frankly avow my opinion that it is hardly possible     for the chancellor of exchequer to discharge his duties without     your constant and sedulous cooperation or for the official corps     in general to avoid suffering if the members of it make     themselves the judges of the question when and under what     circumstances their absence may be permitted during the sittings     of the house      june 25 1870—i am led to suppose by your absence from the     division yesterday that there may not be a perfectly clear     understanding between us as to the obligations of members of the     government on these occasions yesterday gave occasion of much     inconvenience on account of the entertainment at windsor but all     the members of the government who could be expected to attend     voted in the division except yourself i can say from my own     recollection that as far as regards political officers the     sovereign always permits the claim of the house of commons to     prevail   changes among subordinate members of the government came early of one of these ministers mr gladstone writes to lord granville august 18 1869 “he has great talent and is a most pertinacious worker with a good deal of experience and widely dispersed knowledge of public affairs but he seems to be somewhat angular and better adapted for doing business within a defined province of his own than in common stock or partnership with others” unfortunately the somewhat angular man shared his work with a chief who had intellectual angularities of his own not very smoothly concealed as it happened there was another minister of secondary rank who did not come up to the expected mark “though he has great talents remarkable power of speech and some special qualifications for his department he has not succeeded in it with the house of commons and does not seem very thoroughly to understand pecuniary responsibility and the management of estimates and there is no doubt whatever that in his department the present house of commons will be vigilant and exacting while the rapid growth of its expenditures certainly shows that it should be filled by some one capable of exercising control” not thoroughly “to understand pecuniary responsibility” was counted a deadly sin in those halcyon days so the transgressor accepted a diplomatic mission and this made room to plant his angular colleague in what seemed a “province of his own” but few provinces are definite enough to be independent of the treasury and the quarrels between this minister and the chancellor of the exchequer became something of a scandal and a weakness to the government one of the fiercest battles of the time 1872 broke out in respect of kew gardens between the minister with a definite province of his own and a distinguished member of “a scientific fraternity which valuable as it is has been unduly pampered of late from a variety of causes into a somewhat overweening idea of its own importance” the premier’s pacifying resources were taxed by this tremendous feud to the uttermost he holds a stiffish tone to the minister and tries balm for the savant by propitiatory reminder of “a most interesting fact made known to me when i had the pleasure and advantage of seeing you at kew namely the possibility of saving for purposes of food a portion of the substance of the diseased potato the rescue of a sensible percentage of this valuable esculent will be a noble service rendered by scientific knowledge and skill to the general community” but science is touchy and wounds are sometimes too deep to be healed by words  m139 a point worth noting is his strict limitation of his own rights as head of a government “hope you will not think” he wrote to a colleague “i am evading my duties but while it is my duty to deal with all difficulties arising between members of the government it is wholly beyond my power and in no way belongs to my province to examine and settle the controversies which may arise between them and civil servants who are employed under them” he is careful to distinguish his own words from the words of the cabinet careful both to lean upon and to defer to the judgment of that body and when the decision is taken it is in their name that he writes to the vexatious colleague july 24 1872 “the cabinet have come to their conclusion and directed me to make it known to you if you think proper to make the announcement of these intentions of the government they are quite willing that you should do so if otherwise mr bruce will do it as home minister thus far as to making known what will be done as to the doing of it the rules will have to be cancelled at once by you”  the reader of an authoritarian or arbitrary cast of mind may ask why he did not throw a handful of dust upon the angry combatants “it is easy” he wrote to cardwell nov 20 1871 “to talk of uprooting x but even if it were just it will as glyn the party whip would tell you be very difficult but y perhaps proceeds more like moloch and x in the manner of belial why cannot they follow the good example of those worthies who cooperated in pandemonium if you thought you could manage y i would try to tackle x i commend this subject to your meditations” sulphureous whiffs from this pandemonium were pretty copiously scented both by parliament and the public and did the ministry some harm  of a peer of much renown in points of procedure private business and the like he says “he looks at everything out of blinkers and has no side lights” of one brilliant and able colleague in the first administration he writes that “he has some blank in his mental constitution owing to which he receives admonitions most kindly and then straightway does the same thing over again” of another colleague “though much nearer the rights of the case than many who were inclined to object he is thin and poor in the cabinet” some one else is “a sensitive man given beyond most men to speak out his innermost and perhaps unformed thoughts and thereby to put himself at a disadvantage” another public servant is “not unmanageable but he needs to be managed” in the same letter he speaks of the hibernian presbyterian as “that peculiar cross between a scotchman and an irishman”  of his incessant toil the reader has already a good idea here are a few items to one correspondent jan 21 1869 he writes “i hope you do not think my ‘holiday’ at hawarden has proved my idleness for i think ten hours a day has been a moderate estimate of my work there on public business to which some other matters have had to be added” to the attorneygeneral he says when he has had three years more of it sept 18 1872 “i cannot say with you that my office never gives me a day without business for in the four ‘vacations’ so far as they have gone i think i have had no less than five days this vacation has thus far been the best but heavy and critical work impends” in october 1871 he writes to mrs gladstone from edinburgh “i have for the first time since the government was formed had a holiday of two whole days” to lord clarendon he writes from lord granville’s at walmer sept 2 1869 “at the end of a holiday morning of work since i breakfasted at nine which has lasted till near four i have yet to say a few words about” to archdeacon harrison may 25 1873 “as you may like to have the exact anatomy of my holiday on the queen’s birthday i will give it you 214 am return home from the h of c 10 am two hours’ work in my room 27 the cabinet threequarters of an hour’s walk 812 thirtytwo to dinner and an evening party 12 bed” to sir r phillimore july 23 1873 “not once this year except a day in bed have i been absent from the hours of government business in the house and the rigour of attendance is far greater now than at earlier periods of the session”  his colleagues grudged his absence for a day on one occasion in accordance with a lifelong passion and rooted habit he desired to attend a funeral this time in scotland and lord granville’s letter of remonstrance to him is interesting in more points than one it shows the exacting position in which the peculiarities of some colleagues and of a certain section of his supporters placed him—       it is the unanimous desire of the cabinet that i should try to     dissuade you it is a duty of a high order for you to do all     you can for your health you hardly ever are absent from the     house without some screw getting loose i should write much more     strongly if i did not feel i had a personal interest in the     matter in so strained a state as europe is now in the slightest     thing may lead to great consequences and it is possible that it     may be a disadvantage to me and to the chose publique if     anything occurs during the thirtysix hours you are absent   this letter of lord granville’s was written on july 10 1870 just five days before war was declared between france and prussia  he wrote to the spectator may 1873 to correct a report “that every day must begin for me with my old friend homer” he says “as to my beginning every day with homer as such a phrase conveys to the world a very untrue impression of the demands of my present office i think it right to mention that so far as my memory serves me i have not read homer for fifty lines now for a quarter of an hour consecutively for the last four years and any dealings of mine with homeric subjects have been confined to a number of days which could be readily counted on the fingers” yet at the end of 1869 he winds up a letter of business by saying “i must close i am going to have a discussion with huxley on the immortality of the soul”  who can wonder that after a prolonged spell of such a strain as this he was found laying down strong doctrine about the age of a prime minister bishop wilberforce met him twice in the may of 1873 “gladstone much talking how little real good work any premier had done after sixty peel palmerston his work really all done before duke of wellington added nothing to his reputation after i told him dr clark thought it would be physically worse for him to retire ‘dr clark does not know how completely i should employ myself’ he replied” four days later “gladstone again talking of sixty as full age of premier”273    ii   in words already quoted mr gladstone spoke of most of his life having been given to working the institutions of his country of all these institutions—house of commons lords cabinet church stern courts of law—that which he was most apt to idealise was the throne his sense of chivalry and his sense of an august tradition continuously symbolised by a historic throne moved him as the sight of the french queen at versailles had moved the majestic political imagination of burke a century before about the throne he sometimes used language that represented almost at its highest the value set upon it in textbooks of the constitution and in the current conventions of ceremonial speech274 although what he called the iron necessities of actual business always threw these conventions into the background when the time came yet his inmost feeling about the crown and the person of its wearer was as sincere as it was fervid in business it is true he never yielded yet even in his most anxious and pressing hours he spared neither time nor toil in endeavours to show the queen why he could not yield “though decisions” he said “must ultimately conform to the sense of those who are to be responsible for them yet their business is to inform and persuade the sovereign not to overrule him” one writer describes the queen as “superb in standing sentry over the business of the empire” this is obsequious phrasemaking but i will borrow the figure in saying what is more real that mr gladstone from beginning to end stood sentry over the interests whether profound and enduring or trivial and fleeting of the ancient monarchy of this kingdom none who heard it will ever forget the moving and energetic passage in which when he was the doughty veteran of eighty years speaking against his own followers on some question of a royal annuity he moved the whole house to its depths by the passionate declaration “i am not ashamed to say that in my old age i rejoice in any opportunity that enables me to testify that whatever may be thought of my opinions whatever may be thought of my proposals in general politics i do not forget the service that i have borne to the illustrious representative of the british monarchy”275  m140 my readers have had opportunity enough of judging mr gladstone’s estimate of the queen’s shrewdness simplicity high manners above all he constantly said how warmly he recognised her sincerity frankness straightforwardness and love of truth on the other side his own eager mobility versatility and wide elastic range was not likely to be to the taste of a personage with a singular fixity of nature then the queen was by the necessity of her station a politician as was elizabeth or george iii although oddly enough she had a bitter dislike of what she thought the madness of “women’s rights” as politician she often took views that were not shared either by the constituencies or by the ministers whom the constituencies imposed upon her the queen in truth excellently represented and incorporated in her proper person one whole set of those qualities in our national character on which the power of her realm had been built up mr gladstone stood for a different and in some aspects and on some occasions almost an antagonistic set of national qualities the queen according to those who knew her well276 dreaded what in the eighteenth century they called enthusiasm she dreaded or disdained it in religion and in politics almost more yet her englishmen are full of capacity for enthusiasm and the scots for whom she had such cordial affection have enthusiasm in measure fuller still unhappily in the case of ireland that occupied so much of mr gladstone’s life her sympathies with his long and vigorous endeavour notoriously stood at zero the queen’s loyalty to the constitution and to ministers in office was unquestioned but she was not well placed nor was she perhaps by character well fitted to gauge the fluctuating movements of an age of change as it was the duty of her statesmen to gauge and plumb them if a cabinet with the confidence of the house of commons decides upon a policy it must obviously be a premier’s duty to persist and in that duty mr gladstone was resolute if he had been otherwise he knew that he would be falling short in loyalty to the country and to its chief magistrate most of all  in 1871 a wave of critical feeling began to run upon the throne an influential journalist of that day singularly free from any tincture of republican sentiment thus describes it “a few weeks ago” he says “a deep and universal feeling of discontent at the queen’s seclusion or rather at its consequences found voice in the journals of the country no public print of any importance failed to take part in the chorus which was equally remarkable for its suddenness fulness and harmony indeed the suddenness of the cry was surprising—till we remembered that what was then said had lain unexpressed in the minds of the whole community for years with annual increment and that when popular feeling gathers in that way it is generally relieved at last by something of the nature of an explosion” he then goes on to speak of “republicanism of a very revolutionary form flooding in” and says that such a complexion of affairs could be viewed with pleasure by no friend of the monarchy277 the details of this movement are no longer of much interest and they only concern us here because they gave mr gladstone real anxiety for him it was one of the special duties of a prime minister as distinguished from his cabinet to watch and guard relations between the crown and the country whether in office or in opposition he lost no opportunity of standing forth between the throne and even a faint shadow of popular or parliamentary discontent he had done it in the case of prince albert278 and he did it now when the end came after nearly thirty years from our present date the queen wrote “i shall ever gratefully remember his devotion and zeal in all that concerned my personal welfare and that of my family” in 1871 his zeal went beyond the queen’s personal welfare and his solicitude for the institution represented by the queen undoubtedly took a form of deferential exhortation—an exhortation that she should return to a fuller discharge of public duty which the queen found irksome the queen was as fond of balmoral as mr gladstone was fond of hawarden the contrast between the formality of windsor and the atmosphere of simple attachment and social affection that surrounded her in scotland was as delightful to her as the air and the scenery a royal progress through applauding multitudes in great cities made her ill hence when mr gladstone pressed her to defer a northern journey or to open parliament or to open a bridge or otherwise emerge from seclusion the queen though well aware that he had not and could not have any motive save her own and the public interest undoubtedly felt that her energetic minister was attempting to overwork her this feeling as most of us know breeds resistance and even in time resentment to say however that “in his eagerness mr gladstone pressed her to do what she knew to be not her work so much as his” is misleading and a little ludicrous279 mr gladstone had persuaded himself that in the humour of the day persistence in seclusion did harm it was his duty to give advice accordingly and this duty he could not consent to shirk  in other ways his very awe of the institution made him set an exacting standard for the individual who represented it the letters contain a hundred instances one may suffice on the occasion of the irish church bill of 1869 the prime minister sent to the queen a print of its clauses and along with this draft a letter covering over a dozen closelywritten quarto pages in explanation himself intensely absorbed and his whole soul possessed by the vital importance of what he was doing he could not conceive that the sovereign nursing a decided dislike of his policy should not eagerly desire to get to the bottom of the provisions for carrying the policy out the queen read the letter and reread it and then in despair desired a gentleman practised in dealing with parliamentary bills happening at that time to be at osborne to supply her with a summary280 the gaunt virtues of a précis—a meagre thing where qualifying sentences drop off parentheses are cut out adverbs hardly count the noun stands denuded of its sheltering adjective—were never congenial to mr gladstone’s copious exactitude in hypothesis conditions and contingencies neither of these two illustrious personages was without humour and it seems at once a wonder and a pity that the monarch did less than justice to this laborious and almost military sense of discipline and duty in the minister while the minister failed in genial allowance for the moderation of a royal lady’s appetite for bread and honey from the draftsman’s kitchen if failing there were it was natural to a man of earnest and concentrated mind be all this as it may he became more and more conscious that the correspondence and occurrences of 18712 had introduced a reserve that was new perhaps it recalled to him the distance and formality that marked the relations between king george iii and the proudest the most intrepid and the greatest of his prime ministers    iii   once in a conversation with mr gladstone i asked him whether he remembered peel’s phrase to cobden about the odious power that patronage confers he replied “i never felt that when i was prime minister it came in the day’s work like the rest i don’t recall that i ever felt plagued by improper applications peel was perhaps a little over fond of talking of the sacrifices of office a man has no business to lay himself out for being prime minister or to place himself in the way of it unless he is prepared to take all the incidents of the post whether disagreeable or not i’ve no sympathy with talk of that kind” he was far from the mind of carteret “what is it to me” cried that glittering minister “who is a judge or who is a bishop it is my business to make kings and emperors and to maintain the balance of europe”  m141 to the bestowal of honours he brought the same diligent care as to branches of public business that to men of peel’s type seemed worthier of care he treated honours on fixed considerations especially in the altitudes of the peerage he tried hard to find solid political ground to go upon he noted the remarkable fact that though a very large majority of the peerages granted since 1835 had been made on the advice of liberal ministers yet such is the influence of wealth and privileged station that the liberal minority in the lords had decreased in 1869 the conservative majority was between sixty and seventy without counting bishops or nominal liberals yet household suffrage at this very time had immensely increased the moral strength of the house of commons the crisis upon the irish church had been borne with impatience and mr gladstone discerned a combustible temper at the action of the lords that might easily have burst into flame still he saw no signal plan for improving the upper house the appointment of life peers might be desirable he said but it was not easy to arrange nor could its effect be great the means of action therefore for bringing the lords into more conformity or better proportions to the commons were very moderate but that made it all the more important that they should not be overlooked the governing idea in respect of both classes of hereditary honours was in his judgment the maintenance of a due relation between the members in those elevated ranks and the number of persons offering the proper conditions for promotion of this kind in a country so rapidly growing in wealth and population  with characteristic love of making knowledge quantitative—one definition i rather think of science—mr gladstone caused returns to be prepared for him which showed that in 1840 there were about seventeen peers for every million of the population while in 1869 this number had fallen to fourteen in 1880 it was about the same lord palmerston in his second government appears to have recommended sixteen peerages and lord derby in little more than a quarter of the time recommended fourteen mr gladstone himself during his first administration excluding royal nonpolitical and exofficio peerages added thirty members to the house of lords besides making five promotions in the same period twelve peerages became extinct lord beaconsfield counting the same exclusions created between 1874 and 1880 twentysix new peers and made nine promotions281  in two directions mr gladstone made an honourable innovation he recommended a member of the jewish faith for a peerage and in the first list of his submissions to the queen two roman catholics were included no catholic peer had been created within living memory one of these two was lord acton afterwards so intimate a friend whose character he told the queen “is of the first order and he is one of the most learned and accomplished though one of the most modest and unassuming men of the day” if religious profession was not in his eyes relevant in making peers neither was the negation of profession for at the same time he proposed a peerage to grote “i deeply and gratefully appreciate” he wrote to mr gladstone “the sentiments you are pleased to express respecting my character and services these i shall treasure up never to be forgotten coming as they do from a minister who has entered on the work of reform with a sincerity and energy never hitherto paralleled such recognition is the true and sufficient recompense for all useful labours of mine”282  at the same time the prime minister thought that some honour ought to be tendered to mr mill but lord granville whom he consulted thought otherwise “merely on the ground that honours should go as much as possible with general acceptance” lord granville was a man of thoroughly liberal and even generous mind still not particularly qualified to be a good judge either of the merits of a man like mill or of his “acceptance” in circles well worth considering    iv   it was to be expected that preferments in the church should get a special share of mr gladstone’s laborious attention and so they did as member for oxford he had been so much importuned in lord palmerston’s time that he wrote in a moment of unusual impatience 1863 “i think these church preferments will be the death of me” palmerston favoured the evangelicals and mr gladstone was mortified that church did not succeed stanley in the chair of ecclesiastical history at oxford and that wilberforce was not elevated to the throne of york in 1862  m142 during his first administration he recommended for no fewer than twelve bishoprics and eight deaneries he was not unprepared to find as he put it to acland that “saints theologians preachers pastors scholars philosophers gentlemen men of business—these are not to be had every day least of all are they to be commonly found in combination but these are the materials which ought to be sought out and put forward in the church of england if she is to stand the trials and do her work”  according to his fashion he wrote down upon a fragmentary piece of paper what qualifications he ought to look for in a bishop and this is the list—       piety learning sacred eloquence administrative power     faithful allegiance to the church and to the church of england     activity tact and courtesy in dealings with men knowledge of the     world accomplishments and literature an equitable spirit     faculty of working with his brother bishops some legal habit of     mind circumspection courage maturity of age and character     corporal vigour liberal sentiments on public affairs a     representative character with reference to shades of opinion     fairly allowable in the church   one of his earliest preferments that of dr temple to the bishopric of exeter created lively excitement he had been a contributor to essays and reviews—       on some of the papers contained in the volume mr gladstone wrote     to the bishop of lichfield i look with a strong aversion but dr     temple’s responsibility prior to the publication was confined to     his own essay the question whether he ought to have disclaimed or     denounced any part of the volume afterwards is a difficult one     and if it was a duty it was a duty in regard to which a generous     man might well go wrong as regards his own essay i read it at     the time of publication and thought it of little value but did     not perceive that it was mischievous   in speaking of him to acland in 1865 mr gladstone had let fall a truly remarkable saying going deep down to the roots of many things—       you need not assure me of dr temple’s christian character i have     read his sermons and if i had doubted—but i never did—they would     have removed the doubt indeed i think it a most formidable     responsibility at the least in these times to doubt any man’s     character on account of his opinions the limit of possible     variation between character and opinion ay between character and     belief is widening and will widen   how could the leading mark of progress made in mr gladstone’s age be more truly hit how defined with more pith and pregnancy how could the illumination of his own vigorous mind in forty years of life and thought be better demonstrated it would even be no bad thing if those who are furthest removed from mr gladstone’s opinions either in religion or politics could lay this farreaching dictum of his to heart by many men in all schools his lesson is sorely needed shrill was the clamour dr pusey in mr gladstone’s own phrase was “rabid” he justified his anger by reputed facts which proved to be no facts at all but the anger did not die with the fable even phillimore was disquieted “it has cut very deep indeed” he said mr gladstone confident of his ground was not dismayed “the movement against dr temple is like a peculiar cheer we sometimes hear in the house of commons vehement but thin”  no appointment proved so popular and successful as that of bishop fraser to manchester he was the first person named by mr gladstone for the episcopate without some degree of personal knowledge a remarkable concurrence of testimony established the great breadth of his sympathies a trait much in his favour for the particular see of manchester yet strange to say when by and by stanley died mr gladstone was a party to trying to remove fraser from the north to westminster  when in 1883 mr gladstone was challenged as confining his recommendations to the high church side he defended himself to sufficient purpose he had a list made out of appointments to bishoprics deaneries and the most important parishes—       there have been thirty important appointments out of them i have     recommended eleven who would probably be called high churchmen     not one of them so far as i know unsympathetic towards other     portions of the clergy and nineteen who are not on further     examination it will appear that the high churchmen whom i take to     be a decided majority of the clergy as well as a decided minority     of my recommendations have gone as a rule to the places of hard     work and little pay for example they have got five out of ten     parochial recommendations but out of sixteen appointments to     deaneries and canonries they have received four and those with     the exception of mr furse the worst i could supply you with the     lists in detail      one admission i must make the evidently broad churchmen are too     large a proportion of the nonhigh and the low churchmen rather     too small a disproportion which i should hope to remove but     undoubtedly the low churchman of the present day has a poorer     share than half a century ago of the working energy of the church      all these terms high low and broad are rather repugnant to me     but i use them as a currency of tokens with which it is difficult     to dispense   turning from this point of view to the recognition of learning and genius in the course of his first administration we find that he made church dean of st paul’s and scott of the greek lexicon dean of rochester liddon and lightfoot canons of st paul’s kingsley first canon of chester and then of westminster vaughan master of the temple     chapter xi catholic country and protestant parliament 1873       it is all very well to establish united education but if the     persons to be educated decline to unite your efforts will be     thrown away the question then occurs whether it is best to     establish a system rejected by those concerned in the hope that     it will gradually work its way into acceptance in spite of the     intolerance of priests or to endow the separate denominational     bodies on the ground that even such education is better than none     or finally to do nothing the question is one of statesmanship     enlightened by a knowledge of facts and of the sentiments of the     population—leslie stephen    i   descending from her alien throne the irish church had now taken her place among the most prosperous of free communions to irish cultivators a definite interest of possession had been indirectly confirmed in the land to which most of its value had been given by their own toil a third branch of the upas tree of poisonous ascendency described by mr gladstone during the election of 1868 still awaited his axe the fitness of an absentee parliament to govern ireland was again to be tested this time the problem was hardest of all for it involved direct concession by nations inveterately protestant to a catholic hierarchy having at its head an ultramontane cardinal of uncompromising opinions and inexorable will  everybody knew that the state of university education in ireland stood in the front rank of unsettled questions ever since the establishment of three provincial colleges by peel’s government in 1845 the flame of the controversy had been alight even on the very night when graham introduced the bill creating them no less staunch a tory and protestant than sir robert inglis had jumped up and denounced “a gigantic scheme of godless education” the catholics loudly echoed this protestant phrase the three colleges were speedily condemned by the pope as fatal to faith and morals and were formally denounced by the synod of thurles in 1850 the fulminations of the church did not extinguish these modest centres of light and knowledge but they cast a creeping blight upon them in 1865 a demand was openly made in parliament for the incorporation by charter of a specifically catholic university mr gladstone along with sir george grey then admitted the reality of a grievance namely the absence in ireland of institutions of which the catholics of the country were able to avail themselves declining for good reasons or bad to use opportunities of college education by the side of protestants and not warmed by the atmosphere and symbols of their own church and faith catholics contended that they could not be said to enjoy equal advantages with their fellowcitizens of other creeds they repudiated a system of education repugnant to their religious convictions and in the persistent efforts to force ’godless education’ on their country they professed to recognise another phase of persecution for conscience’ sake  in 1866 lord russell’s government tried its hand with a device known as the supplemental charter it opened a way to a degree without passing through the godless colleges this was set aside by an injunction from the courts and it would not have touched the real matter of complaint even if the courts had let it stand next year the tories burnt their fingers though mr disraeli told parliament that he saw no scars for a time he believed that an honourable and satisfactory settlement was possible and negotiations went on with the hierarchy the prelates did not urge endowment mr disraeli afterwards said but “they mentioned it” the country shrank back from concurrent endowment though as mr disraeli truly said it was the policy of pitt of grey of russell of peel and of palmerston ever since 1794 catholic students had been allowed to graduate at trinity college and ever since the disestablishment of the irish church in 1869 trinity had asked parliament for power to admit catholics to her fellowships and emoluments this however did not go to the root whether we regard it as sound or unsound of the catholic grievance which was in fact their lack of an endowed institution as distinctively catholic in all respects as trinity was protestant  such was the case with which mr gladstone was called upon to grapple and a delicate if not even a desperate case it was the prelates knew what they wished though they lay in shadow what they wanted a protestant parliament with its grip upon the purse was determined that they should not have the same conclusion as came to many liberals by prejudice was reached by the academic school on principle on principle they held denominational endowment of education to be retrograde and obscurantist then there was the discouraging consideration of which lord halifax reminded mr gladstone “you say with truth” he observed when the situation had developed “that the liberal party are behaving very ill and so they are but liberal majorities when large are apt to run riot no men could have stronger claims on the allegiance of their party than lord grey and lord althorp after carrying the reform bill nevertheless the large majority after the election of 18323 was continually putting the government into difficulty” so it befell now and now as then the difficulty was irish    ii   m143 well knowing the hard work before him mr gladstone applied himself with his usual indomitable energy to the task “we go to oxford tomorrow” he writes to lord granville nov 12 “to visit edward talbot and his wife forward to london on thursday when i dine with the templars my idea of work is that the first solid and heavy bit should be the irish university—some of this may require to be done in cabinet when we have got that into shape i should be for taking to the yet stiffer work of local taxation—most of the cabinet take a personal interest in this i think it will require immeasurable talking over which might be done chiefly in an open informal cabinet before any binding resolutions are taken but i propose to let palmer have his say general about law reform on friday” at oxford he saw dr pusey “who behaved with all his old kindness and seemed to have forgotten the temple283 business or rather as if it had never been” on november 20 he records “cabinet 2346½ some heads of a measure on irish university education” no communications were opened with the irish bishops beforehand probably from a surmise that they would be bound to ask more than they could obtain       jan 16 1873 hawarden—dr ingram the distinguished fellow of     trinity college came in afternoon and i was able to spend     several hours with him on the university question 17—many hours     with dr ingram on the bill and

explanation diary   phillimore has an interesting note or two on his friend at this critical time—       feb 2—gladstone looking well but much aged spoke of anxiety     to retire when he could do so with honour said he had forced     himself into the study of the whole question relating to trinity     college dublin and that he was sure that his enemies did not     understand the very curious facts relative to the university it     seemed as if he meant to frame the government measure on a     historical and antiquarian basis this will not satisfy the     country if the practical result is to place more power in the     hands of the papists 10—gladstone looked very worn and anxious     spoke about the relief he should experience after thursday the     weight of the matter which he had to deal with and the general     misapprehension which prevailed thought the tide was turning in     their favour 11—gladstone in high spirits confident of success     on thursday 14—dined at gladstone’s our host in high spirits at     his achievement of yesterday   the leading provisions of the measure though found by the able and expert draftsman unusually hard to frame may be very shortly stated for the question by the way is still in full blast a new university of dublin was to rise a teaching as well as an examining body governed by a council who were to appoint officers and regulate all matters and things affecting the university the constitution of this governing council was elaborately devised and it did not make clerical predominance ultimately impossible the affiliation of colleges not excluding purely denominational institutions was in their hands there were to be no religious tests for either teachers or taught and religious profession was to be no bar to honours and emoluments money was provided by trinity college the consolidated fund and the church surplus to the tune of £50000 a year the principle was the old formula of mixed or united education in which protestants and catholics might side by side participate  m144 what many found intolerably obnoxious were two “gagging clauses” by one of these a teacher or other person of authority might be suspended or deprived who should in speaking or writing be held to have wilfully given offence to the religious convictions of any member the second and graver of them was the prohibition of any university teacher in theology modern history or moral and mental philosophy the separate affiliated colleges might make whatever arrangements they pleased for these subjects but the new university would not teach them directly and authoritatively this was undoubtedly a singular limitation for a university that had sent forth berkeley and burke nor was there ever a moment when in spite of the specialisation of research the deepest questions in the domain of thought and belief more inevitably thrust themselves forward within common and indivisible precincts    iii   on feb 14 mr gladstone reported to the queen—       the general impression last night appeared to be that the friends     of trinity college were relieved that the liberal party and the     nonconformists were well satisfied with the conformity between the     proposed measure and the accepted principles of university     organisation in england but that the roman catholics would think     themselves hardly or at least not generously used all that mr     gladstone has heard this morning through private channels as well     as the general tone of the press tends to corroborate the     favourable parts of what he gathered last night and to give hope     that reasonable and moderate roman catholics may see that their     real grievances will be removed generally also to support the     expectation that the bill is not likely to pass   delane of the times said to manning when they were leaving the house of commons “this is a bill made to pass” manning himself heartily acquiesced even the bitterest of mr gladstone’s critics below the gangway on his own side agreed that if a division could have been taken while the house was still under the influence of the three hours’ speech the bill would have been almost unanimously carried284 “it threw the house into a mesmeric trance” said the seconder of a hostile motion effects like these not purple passages not epigrams nor aphorisms are the test of oratory mr bruce wrote home feb 15 “alas i fear all prospect of ministerial defeat is over the university bill is so well received that people say there will not be even a division on the second reading i see no other rock ahead but sometimes they project their snouts unexpectedly and cause shipwreck”  soon did the projecting rocks appear out of the smooth water lord spencer had an interview with cardinal cullen at dublin castle feb 25 and found him though in very good humour and full of gratitude for fair intentions yet extremely hostile to the bill it was in flat opposition he said to what the roman catholics had been working for in ireland for years it continued the queen’s colleges and set up another queen’s college in the shape of trinity college with a large endowment it perpetuated the mixed system of education to which he had always been opposed and no endowment nor assistance was given to the catholic university the council might appoint professors to teach english literature geology or zoology who would be dangerous men in catholic eyes lord spencer gathered that the cardinal would be satisfied with a sum down to redress inequality or a grant for buildings  archbishop manning wrote to cardinal cullen the day after the bill was produced “strongly urging them to accept it” it seemed to him to rest on a base so broad that he could not tell how either the opposition or the radical doctrinaires could attack it without adopting “the german tyranny” he admitted that he was more easily satisfied than if he were in ireland but he thought the measure framed with skill and success after a fortnight the archbishop told mr gladstone that he still saw reason to believe that the irish hierarchy would not refuse the bill on march 3rd he says he has done his utmost to conciliate confidence in it by the 7th he knew that his efforts had failed but he urges mr gladstone not to take the episcopal opposition too much to heart “nonendowment mixed education and godless colleges are three bitter things to them” “this” he wrote to mr gladstone when all was over march 12 “is not your fault nor the bill’s fault but the fault of england and scotland and three anticatholic centuries”  m145 the debate began on march 3rd and extended to four sittings the humour of the house was described by mr gladstone as “fitful and fluctuating” speeches “void of real argument or point yet aroused the mere prejudices of a section of the liberal party against popery and did much to place the bill in danger” then that cause of apprehension disappeared and a new change passed over the shifting sky for the intentions of irish members were reported to be dubious there was not a little heat and passion mainly from below the ministerial gangway the gagging clauses jarred horribly though they were trenchantly defended by mr lowe the very man to whose line of knowledge and intellectual freedom they seemed likely to be most repugnant it soon appeared that neither protestant nor catholic set any value on these securities for conscience and the general assembly of the presbyterians declared war upon the whole scheme the cabinet—“most harmonious at this critical time”—still held firmly that the bill was well constructed so that if it once reached committee it would not be easy to inflict mortal wounds on march 8th the prime minister reported to the queen—       strange to say it is the opposition of the roman catholic bishops     that brings about the present difficulty and this although they     have not declared an opposition to the bill outright but have     wound up their list of objections with a resolution to present     petitions praying for its amendment still their attitude of what     may be called growling hostility has had these important results     firstly it has deadened that general willingness of the liberal     party which the measure itself had created to look favourably on     a plan such as they might hope would obtain acquiescence and     bring about contentment secondly the great majority of the     bishops are even more hostile than the resolutions which were     apparently somewhat softened as the price of unanimity and all     these bishops working upon liberal irish members through their     political interest in their seats have proceeded so far that from     twenty to twentyfive may go against the bill and as many may     stay away when to these are added the small knot of discontented     liberals and mere fanatics which so large a party commonly     contains the government majority now taken at only 85     disappears      it is not in the power or the will of your majesty’s advisers to     purchase irish support by subserviency to the roman bishops their     purpose has been to offer justice to all and their hope has been     that what was just would be seen to be advantageous as far as the     roman catholics of ireland are concerned the cabinet conceive     that they are now at perfect liberty to throw up the bill but     they are also of opinion that its abandonment would so impair or     destroy their moral power as to render it impossible for them to     accept the defeat there are whispers of a desire in the liberal     party should the catastrophe arrive to meet it by a vote of     confidence which would probably be carried by a still larger     majority but the cabinet look with extreme disfavour upon this     method of proceeding which would offer them the verbal promise of     support just when its substance had been denied   he then proceeds to more purely personal aspects and contingencies—       what lies beyond it would be premature to describe as having been     regularly treated or even opened today mr gladstone considers     himself far more tied to the bill and the subject than his     colleagues and if they upon a defeat were disposed to carry on     the government without him he would with your majesty’s sanction     take effectual means to provide at least against his being an     impediment in the way of an arrangement eligible in so many points     of view but his colleagues appear at present indisposed to adopt     this method of solution there would then remain for them the     question whether they should humbly tender their resignations to     your majesty or whether they should advise a dissolution of the     parliament which was elected under other auspices this would be     a matter of the utmost gravity for consideration at the proper     time mr gladstone as at present advised has no foregone     conclusion in favour of either alternative and would act with his     colleagues as between them but he does not intend to go into     opposition and the dissolution of this government brought about     through languor and through extensive or important defections in     the liberal party which has made him its leader would be the     close of his political life he has now for more than forty years     striven to serve the crown and country to the best of his power     and he is willing though with overtaxed faculties and diminishing     strength to continue the effort longer if he sees that the     continuance can be conducive to the objects which he has     heretofore had at heart but the contingency to which he has last     referred would be for him the proof that confidence was gone     that usefulness was at an end and that he might and ought to     claim the freedom which best befits the close of life   the next day in reporting that the estimates of the coming division were far from improving mr gladstone returned in a few words to the personal point—       mr gladstone is very grateful for your majesty’s caution against     being swayed by private feelings and he will endeavour to be on     his guard against them he has however always looked to the     completion of that commission so to call it which events in a     measure threw into his hands five years ago as the natural close     of the main work of the present government and many circumstances     have combined to impress him with the hope that thus an honourable     path would be opened for his retirement he ought perhaps to add     that he has the strongest opinion upon political grounds and     grounds other than political against spending old age under the     strain of that perpetual contention which is inseparable from his     present position and this opinion could only be neutralised by     his perceiving a special call to remain that is to say some     course of public service to be done by him better than if it were     in other hands such a prospect he neither sees nor anticipates     but it is premature to trouble your majesty on this minor subject   on the 9th cardinal cullen blazed forth in a pastoral that was read in all the churches he described the bill as richly endowing noncatholic and godless colleges and without giving one farthing to catholics inviting them to compete in their poverty produced by penal laws and confiscations with those left in possession of enormous wealth the new university scheme only increased the number of queen’s colleges so often and so solemnly condemned by the catholic church and by all ireland and gave a new impulse to that sort of teaching that separates education from religion and its holy influences and banishes god the author of all good from our schools the prelate’s pastoral had a decisive effect in regions far removed from the ambit of his crosier the tory leader could not resist a temptation thus offered by the attitude of the irish cardinal and the measure that had been much reviled as a dark concordat between mr gladstone and the pope was now rejected by a concordat between the pope’s men and mr disraeli  the discussion was on a high level in mr gladstone’s judgment lyon playfair criticised details with some severity and much ability but intended to vote for the bill miall the nonconformist leader supported the second reading but required alterations that were admissible enough on march 10 mr harcourt who was not yet an old member “opened the discussion by a speech in advance of any he has yet delivered as to effect upon the house severe in criticism on detail he was favourable to the substance of the bill” one significant incident of the debate was a declaration by bentinck a conservative ultra that he would vote against the bill in reliance on the declaration of mr hardy which he understood to be a pledge for himself and others near him not to take office during the existence of the present parliament “mr hardy remained silent during this appeal which was several times repeated” then the end came march 1112—       mr disraeli rose at halfpast ten and spoke amidst rapt     attention till midnight mr gladstone followed in a speech of two     hours and at two o’clock the division was called during the     whole evening the greatest uncertainty had prevailed for himself     mr gladstone leaned to expecting an unfavourable result the     numbers were ayes for the government 284 noes 287 majority     against the government 3 it is said that 45 adherents of the     government or thereabouts voted against them it was the irish     vote that grew continually worse285   m146 of the speech in which the debate was wound up forster says in his diary “gladstone with the house dead against him and his bill made a wonderful speech—easy almost playful with passages of great power and eloquence but with a graceful play which enabled him to plant deep his daggers of satire in horsman and co”286 speaker brand calls it “a magnificent speech generous highminded and without a taint of bitterness although he was sorely tried especially by false friends” he vindicated the obnoxious clauses but did not wish to adhere to them if opinion from all quarters were adverse and he admitted that it was the opposition of members from ireland that principally acted on his hearers his speech contained a remarkable passage pronouncing definitely against denominational endowment of university education     chapter xii the crisis 1873        alla fortuna come vuol son presto     pero giri fortuna la sua rota     come le piace e il villan la sua marra                      —inferno xv 93      for fortune as she wills i am ready so     let her turn her wheel as she may please     and the churl his spade    i   a week of lively and eventful interests followed—not only interesting in the life of mr gladstone but raising points with important constitutional bearings and showing a match between two unsurpassed masters of political swordplay the story was told generally and partially in parliament but the reader who is curious about either the episode itself or mr gladstone’s modes of mind and action will find it worth a little trouble to follow details with some closeness       march 11—h of c spoke 122 and voted in a division of     284287—which was believed to cause more surprise to the opposite     side than it did to me at 245 am i apprised the queen of our     defeat      thursday march 12—saw the queen at 1215 failed to find     granville cabinet 1234 we discussed the matter with a general     tendency to resignation rather than dissolving confab on my     position with granville and glyn then joined by bright to the     queen again at six to keep her informed large dinner party for     the duke of edinburgh and an evening party afterwards to hear     joachim      friday march 13—after seeing mr glyn and lord f cavendish i     went at 1040 to see dr clark he completed his examination and     gave me his careful judgment i went to lord granville sketched     out to him and glyn my views and went to the cabinet at 1215     stated the case between the two alternatives of resignation and     dissolution as far as regarded myself on the side of resignation     it would not be necessary to make any final announcement of his     retirement from the leadership i am strongly advised a temporary     rest on the other hand if we now dissolve i anticipate that     afterwards before any long time difficulties will arise and my     mission will be terminated so that the alternatives are not so     unequally weighed the cabinet without any marked difference or     at least without any positive assertion to the contrary     determined on tendering their resignations287 after cabinet saw     hartington and others respecting honours at 245 saw the queen     and resigned the queen informed me that she would send for mr     disraeli suggested for consideration whether i would include the     mention of this fact in my announcement to parliament and added     as i was leaving the room without looking apparently for an     answer that she would inform me of what might take place at 345     saw granville respecting the announcements made announcement in     house of commons at 430 more business at downing street and     home at six      at a quarter to seven or a little later colonel ponsonby called     with a communication from her majesty “any news” i said “a     great deal” he replied and informed me as follows mr disraeli     had been with the queen did not see the means of carrying on the     government by the agency of his party under present circumstances     did not ask for the dissolution of parliament this was understood     to mean did not offer to become minister on condition of being     permitted to dissolve did not say that his renunciation of the     task was final recommended that the queen should call for my     advice upon this the queen sent colonel ponsonby and he said     “she considers this as sending for you anew” i replied that i did     not regard the queen’s reference of this intelligence to me as     her calling upon me anew to undertake the work of government that     none of my obligations to the sovereign were cancelled or impaired     by the resignation tendered and accepted that i was still the     minister for the purpose of rendering any service she might be     pleased to call for in the matter on which she is engaged exactly     as before until she has a new minister when my official     obligations will come to an end that i felt there was great     inconvenience and danger of misapprehension out of doors in     proceeding overrapidly with a matter of such gravity and that     each step in it required to be well measured and ascertained     before proceeding to consider of the next following step that i     had great difficulty in gathering any precise idea of mr     disraeli’s account of what he could not do and what he either     could or did not say that he could not that as this account was     to present to me the state of facts on which i was commanded to     advise it was quite necessary for me to have an accurate idea of     it in order that i might do justice to her majesty’s commands i     would therefore humbly suggest that mr disraeli might with great     propriety be requested to put his reply into writing that i     presumed i might receive this reply if it were her majesty’s     pleasure to make it known to me at some not late hour tomorrow     when i would at once place myself in a condition to tender my     humble advice this is an account of what colonel ponsonby might     fairly consider as my answer to her majesty’s communication i     enlarged the conversation however by observing that the division     which overthrew us was a party division it bore the express     authentic symbol of its character in having party tellers on the     opposition as well as on the government side that we were aware     of the great even more than ordinary efforts of colonel taylor     with mr disraeli’s countenance to bring members to london and to     the house that all this seemed to impose great obligations on the     opposition and if so that it would be the duty of the leader of     the opposition to use every exertion of consultation with his     friends and otherwise before declining the task or in any manner     advising the queen to look elsewhere to colonel ponsonby indeed     i observed that i thought mr disraeli was endeavouring by at     once throwing back on me an offer which it was impossible for me     at the time and under the circumstances to accept to get up a     case of absolute necessity founded upon this refusal of mine and     thus becoming the indispensable man and party to have in his     hands a lever wherewith to overcome the reluctance and resistance     of his friends who would not be able to deny that the queen must     have a government   m147 mr disraeli’s reply to the queen’s inquiry whether he was prepared to form a government was put into writing and the two operative paragraphs of it were sent through colonel ponsonby to mr gladstone they ran as follows—       in answer mr disraeli said he was prepared to form an     administration which he believed would carry on her majesty’s     affairs with efficiency and would possess her confidence but he     could not undertake to carry on her majesty’s government in the     present house of commons subsequently her majesty having     remarked that mr gladstone was not inclined to recommend a     dissolution of parliament mr disraeli stated that he himself     would not advise her majesty to take that step   viewing these paragraphs as forming the answer offered by mr disraeli to the queen mr gladstone reported to her march 14 that “he did not find himself able to gather their precise effect”—       the former of the two if it stood alone would seem to imply that     mr disraeli was prepared to accept office with a view to an     immediate dissolution of parliament but not otherwise since it     states that he believes himself able to form a suitable     administration but not “to carry on your majesty’s government in     the present house of commons” in the latter of the two paragraphs     mr disraeli has supposed your majesty to have remarked that “mr     gladstone was not inclined to recommend a dissolution of     parliament” and has stated that “he himself would not advise your     majesty to take that step” your majesty will without doubt     remember that mr gladstone tendered no advice on the subject of     dissolution generally but limited himself to comparing it with     the alternative of resignation which was the only question at     issue and stated that on the part of the cabinet he humbly     submitted resignation of their offices which they deemed to be     the step most conformable to their duty mr gladstone does not     clearly comprehend the bearing of mr disraeli’s closing words as     he could not tender advice to your majesty either affirmatively or     negatively on dissolution without first becoming your majesty’s     adviser founding himself upon the memorandum mr gladstone is     unable to say to what extent the apparent meaning of the one     paragraph is modified or altered by the other and he is obliged     to trouble your majesty however reluctantly with this     representation inasmuch as a perfectly clear idea of the tenor of     the reply is a necessary preliminary to his offering any remark or     advice upon it which had it been a simple negative he would     have felt it his duty to do   between six and seven in the evening colonel ponsonby came with a letter from the queen to the effect that mr disraeli had unconditionally declined to undertake the formation of a government in obedience to the queen’s commands mr gladstone proceeded to give his view of the position in which her majesty was placed—       march 15—not being aware that there can be a question of any     intermediate party or combination of parties which would be     available at the present juncture he presumes that your majesty     if denied the assistance of the conservative or opposition party     might be disposed to recur to the services of a liberal     government he is of opinion however that either his late     colleagues or any statesman or statesmen of the liberal party on     whom your majesty might call would with propriety at once observe     that it is still for the consideration of your majesty whether the     proceeding which has taken place between your majesty and mr     disraeli can as yet be regarded as complete the vote of the house     of commons on wednesday morning was due to the deliberate and     concerted action of the opposition with a limited amount of     adventitious numerical aid the division was a party division and     carried the wellknown symbol of such divisions in the appointment     of tellers of the opposition and government respectively the vote     was given in the full knowledge avowed in the speech of the     leader of the opposition that the government had formally     declared the measure on which the vote was impending to be vital     to its existence mr gladstone humbly conceives that according     to the wellknown principles of our parliamentary government an     opposition which has in this manner and degree contributed to     bring about what we term a crisis is bound to use and to show     that it has used its utmost efforts of counsel and inquiry to     exhaust all practicable means of bringing its resources to the aid     of the country in its exigency he is aware that his opinion on     such a subject can only be of slight value but the same     observation will not hold good with regard to the force of a     wellestablished party usage to show what that usage has been     mr gladstone is obliged to trouble your majesty with the     following recital of facts from the history of the last half     century this apt and cogent recital the reader will find at     the end of the volume see appendix there is therefore a     very wide difference between the manner in which the call of your     majesty has been met on this occasion by the leader of the     opposition and the manner which has been observed at every former     juncture including even those when the share taken by the     opposition in bringing about the exigency was comparatively slight     or none at all it is in mr gladstone’s view of the utmost     importance to the public welfare that the nation should be     constantly aware that the parliamentary action certain or likely     to take effect in the overthrow of a government the reception and     treatment of a summons from your majesty to meet the necessity     which such action has powerfully aided in creating and again the     resumption of office by those who have deliberately laid it     down—are uniformly viewed as matters of the utmost gravity     requiring time counsel and deliberation among those who are     parties to them and attended with serious responsibilities mr     gladstone will not and does not suppose that the efforts of the     opposition to defeat the government on wednesday morning were made     with a previously formed intention on their part to refuse any aid     to your majesty if the need should arise in providing for the     government of the country and the summary refusal which is the     only fact before him he takes to be not in full correspondence     either with the exigencies of the case or as he has shown with     the parliamentary usage in humbly submitting this representation     to your majesty mr gladstone’s wish is to point out the     difficulty in which he would find himself placed were he to ask     your majesty for authority to inquire from his late colleagues     whether they or any of them were prepared if your majesty should     call on them to resume their offices for they would certainly     he is persuaded call on him for their own honour and in order     to the usefulness of their further service if it should be     rendered to prove to them that according to usage every means had     been exhausted on the part of the opposition for providing for the     government of the country or at least that nothing more was to be     expected from that quarter   this statement prepared after dinner mr gladstone took to lord granville that night march 14 the next morning he again saw lord granville and colonel ponsonby and despatched his statement to the queen “at 245” he writes to granville—       i saw the queen not for any distinct object but partly to fill     the blank before the public hm was in perfect humour she will     use the whole or part of my long letter by sending it to disraeli     she seemed quite to understand our point of view and told me     plainly what shows that the artful man did say if it came back     to him again at this juncture he would not be bound by his     present refusal i said “but ma’am that is not before me” “but     he told it to me” she said   m148 the queen sent mr gladstone’s long letter to mr disraeli and he replied in a tolerably long letter of his own he considered mr gladstone’s observations under two heads first as an impeachment of the opposition for contributing to the vote against the bill when they were not prepared to take office second as a charge against mr disraeli himself that he summarily refused to take office without exhausting all practicable means of aiding the country in the exigency on the first article of charge he described the doctrine advanced by mr gladstone as being “undoubtedly sound so far as this that for an opposition to use its strength for the express purpose of throwing out a government which it is at the time aware that it cannot replace—having that object in view and no other—would be an act of recklessness and faction that could not be too strongly condemned” but this he contended could not be imputed to the conservative opposition of 1873 the irish bill was from the first strongly objected to by a large section of the liberal party and on the same grounds that led the conservative opposition to reject it namely that it sacrificed irish education to the roman catholic hierarchy the party whom the bill was intended to propitiate rejected it as inadequate if the sense of the house had been taken irrespective of considerations of the political result of the division not onefourth of the house would have voted for it mr gladstone’s doctrine disraeli went on amounted to this that “whenever a minister is so situated that it is in his power to prevent any other parliamentary leader from forming an administration likely to stand he acquires thereby the right to call on parliament to pass whatever measures he and his colleagues think fit and is entitled to denounce as factious the resistance to such measures any such claim is one not warranted by usage or reconcilable with the freedom of the legislature it comes to this that he tells the house of commons ‘unless you are prepared to put some one in my place your duty is to do whatever i bid you’ to no house of commons has language of this kind ever been addressed by no house of commons would it be tolerated”  as for the charge of summary refusal to undertake government mr disraeli contented himself with a brief statement of facts he had consulted his friends and they were all of opinion that it would be prejudicial to the public interests for a conservative ministry to attempt to conduct business in the present house of commons what other means were at his disposal was he to open negotiations with a section of the late ministry and waste days in barren interviews vain applications and the device of impossible combinations was he to make overtures to the considerable section of the liberal party that had voted against the government the irish roman catholic gentlemen surely mr gladstone was not serious in such a suggestion the charge of deliberate and concerted action against the irish bill was ’not entirely divested of some degree of exaggeration’ his party was not even formally summoned to vote against the government measure but to support an amendment which was seconded from the liberal benches and which could only by a violent abuse of terms be described as a party move  on saturday afternoon mr gladstone had gone down to cliveden and there at ten o’clock on the sunday evening march 16 he received a message from the queen enclosing mr disraeli’s letter and requesting him to say whether he would resume office this letter was taken by mr gladstone to show that “nothing more was to be expected in that quarter” and at eleven o’clock he sent off the messenger with his answer in the affirmative—       march 16 1873 1034 pm—it is quite unnecessary for him to     comment upon any of the statements or arguments advanced by mr     disraeli as the point referred by your majesty for him to     consider is not their accuracy sufficiency or relevancy but     simply whether any further effort is to be expected from the     opposition towards meeting the present necessity your majesty has     evidently judged that nothing more of this kind can be looked for     your majesty’s judgment would have been conclusive with mr     gladstone in the case even had he failed to appreciate the full     cogency of the reason for it but he is bound to state that he     respectfully concurs with your majesty upon that simple question     as one not of right but of fact he therefore does not hesitate at     once to answer your majesty’s gracious inquiry by saying that he     will now endeavour to prevail upon your majesty’s late advisers     generally to resume their offices and he again places all such     service as it is in his power to offer at your majesty’s     disposal according to your majesty’s command then he will     repair to london tomorrow morning and will see some of the most     experienced members of the late government to review the position     which he regards as having been seriously unhinged by the shock of     last wednesday morning to such an extent indeed that he doubts     whether either the administration or parliament can again be what     they were the relations between them and the course of business     laid down in the royal speech will require to be reconsidered or     at least reviewed with care    ii       tuesday march 18—to the queen the cabinet met informally     at this house 11 carlton house terrace at 2 pm and sat till     5½      the whole of the cabinet were ready to resume their offices it     was decided to carry on the government in the present parliament     without contemplating any particular limit of time for existence     in connection with the recent vote      wednesday march 19—went down to windsor at midday 34 hour     with the queen on the resignation the statement tomorrow the     duke of edinburgh’s marriage royal precedence tennyson’s honour     also she mentioned railway accidents and an assault on a soldier     and on luxury in food and dress dined with the duke of cambridge     speaker’s levee saw mr fawcett who had been active in fomenting     hostility and other members then mrs glyn’s party      thursday march 20—h of c made my explanation advisedly let     pass mr disraeli’s speech without notice   mr gladstone said among other things—       i felt reluctance personally from a desire for rest the title to     which had possibly been  earned by labour also politically     because i do not think that as a general rule the experience we     have had in former years of what may be called returning or     resuming governments has been very favourable in its     character the subsequent fortunes of such governments lead to     the belief that upon the whole though such a return may be the     lesser of two evils yet it is not a thing in itself to be     desired it reminds me of that which was described by the roman     general according to the noble ode of horace—           neque amissos colores       lana refert medicata fuco     nec vera virtus cum semel excidit     curat reponi deterioribus288   mr disraeli made a lengthy statement covering a much wider field the substance of the whole case after all was this the minister could not dissolve for the reason that the defeat had strengthened all the forces against the bill and against the government and the constituencies who had never looked on it with much favour after its rejection by the irish to satisfy whom it had been invented now regarded it with energetic disfavour the leader of the opposition on the other hand produced a long string of ingenious reasons for not abiding by the result of what was his own act as for example that dissolution could not be instant to form a government would take time financial business must be arranged a policy could not be shaped without access to official information in this interval motions would be made and carried on plausible questions and when the election came his friends would go to the country as discredited ministers instead of being a triumphant opposition in writing to his brother robertson mr gladstone glances at other reasons—       march 21—we have gone through our crisis and i fear that     nobody is much the better for it for us it was absolutely     necessary to show that we did not consider return as we had not     considered resignation a light matter as to the opposition the     speech of disraeli last night leaves it to be asked why did he not     come in wind up the business of the session and dissolve there     is no reason to be given except that a portion of his party was     determined not to be educated again and was certain that if he     got in he would again commence this educating process the     conservative party will never assume its natural position until     disraeli retires and i sometimes think he and i might with     advantage pair off together   speaker brand says “disraeli’s tactics are to watch and wait not showing his hand nor declaring a policy he desires to drive gladstone to a dissolution when he will make the most of gladstone’s mistakes while he will denounce a policy of destruction and confiscation and take care to announce no policy of his own his weakness consists in the want of confidence of some of his party”     chapter xiii last days of the ministry 1873       ὤσπερ ἂν εἴ τις ναύκληρον πάντ᾽ ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ πράξαντα καὶ     κατασκευάσαντα τὸ πλοῖον ἀφ᾽ ὧν ὑπελάμβανε σωθήσεσθαι εἶτα     χειμῶνι χρησάμενον καὶ πονησάντων αὐτῷ τῶν σκευῶν ἤ καὶ     συντριβέτων ὅλως τῆς ναυαγίας

strains and labours until     it is torn to pieces we should blame him for the wreck    i   the shock of defeat resignation and restoration had no effect in lessening ministerial difficulties the months that followed make an unedifying close to five glorious years of progress and reform with plenty of differences they recall the sunless days in which the second administration of the younger pitt ended that lofty career of genius and dominion the party was divided and some among its leaders were centres of petty disturbance in a scrap dated at this period mr gladstone wrote “divisions in the liberal party are to be seriously apprehended from a factious spirit on questions of economy on questions of education in relation to religion on further parliamentary change on the land laws on these questions generally my sympathies are with what may be termed the advanced party whom on other and general grounds i certainly will never head nor lead”  the quarrel between the government and the nonconformists was not mitigated by a speech of mr gladstone’s against a motion for the disestablishment of the church it was described by speaker brand as “firm and good” but the dissenters with all their kindness for the prime minister thought it firm and bad289 to dr allon one of the most respected of their leaders mr gladstone wrote july 5—       the spirit of frankness in which you write is ever acceptable to     me i fear there may be much in your sombre anticipations but if     there is to be a great schism in the liberal party i hope i shall     never find it my duty to conduct the operations either of the one     or of the other section the nonconformists have shown me great     kindness and indulgence they have hitherto interpreted my acts     and words in the most favourable sense and if the time has come     when my acts and words pass beyond the measure of their patience     i contemplate with repugnance at my time of life especially the     idea of entering into conflict with them a political severance     somewhat resembling in this a change in religion should at most     occur not more than once in life at the same time i must observe     that no one has yet to my knowledge pointed out the expressions or     arguments in the speech that can justly give offence   a few personal jottings will be found of interest—       april 7 1873—h of c the budget

interview yesterday     at chiselhurst with the empress he thought her majesty much     thinner and more worn than last year but she showed no want of     energy in conversation her majesty felt much interest and a     little anxiety about the coming examination of the prince her son     at woolwich      june 8—chapel royal at noon it was touching to see dean hook     and hear him now old in years and very old i fear in life but he     kindled gallantly 17—had a long conversation with mr holloway     of the pills on his philanthropic plans which are of great     interest 25—audience of the shah with lord granville and the     duke of argyll came away after 114 hours he displayed abundant     acuteness his gesticulation particularly expressive 26—sixteen     to breakfast mme norman neruda played for us she is also most     pleasing in manner and character went to windsor afterwards had     an audience july 1—h of c received the shah soon after six     a division on a trifling matter of adjournment took place during     his majesty’s presence in which he manifested an intelligent     interest the circumstance of his presence at the time is singular     in this view and of this he was informed rather to his     amusement that until the division was over he could not be     released from the walls of the house it is probably or possibly     the first time for more than five hundred years that a foreign     sovereign has been under personal restraint of any kind in     england query mary queen of scots   m149 then we come upon an entry that records one of the deepest griefs of this stage of mr gladstone’s life—the sudden death of bishop wilberforce—       july 19—off at 425 to holmbury290 we were enjoying that     beautiful spot and expecting granville with the bishop of     winchester when the groom arrived with the message that the     bishop had had a bad fall an hour and a half later granville     entered pale and sad “it’s all over” in an instant the thread     of that very precious life was snapped we were all in deep and     silent grief 20—woke with a sad sense of a great void in the     world 21—drove in the morning with lord granville to abinger     hall saw him for the last time in the flesh resting from his     labours attended the inquest inspected the spot all this cannot     be forgotten 23—gave way under great heat hard work and     perhaps depression of force kept my bed all day   “of the special opinions of this great prelate” he wrote to the queen “mr gladstone may not be an impartial judge but he believes there can be no doubt that there does not live the man in any of the three kingdoms of your majesty who has by his own indefatigable and unmeasured labours given such a powerful impulse as the bishop of winchester gave to the religious life of the country” when he mentioned that the bishop’s family declined the proposal of westminster abbey for his last resting place the queen replied that she was very glad for “to her nothing more gloomy and doleful exists”  “few men” mr gladstone wrote later in this very year “have had a more varied experience of personal friendships than myself among the large numbers of estimable and remarkable people whom i have known and who have now passed away there is in my memory an inner circle and within it are the forms of those who were marked off from the comparative crowd even of the estimable and remarkable by the peculiarity and privilege of their type”291 in this inner circle the bishop must have held a place not merely by habit of life which accounts for so many friendships in the world but by fellowship in their deepest interests by common ideals in church and state by common sympathy in their arduous aim to reconcile greetings in the marketplace and occupation of high seats with the spiritual glow of the soul within its own sanctuary  m150 while still grieving over this painful loss mr gladstone suddenly found himself in a cauldron of ministerial embarrassments an inquiry into certain irregularities at the general post office led to the discovery that the sum of eight hundred thousand pounds had been detained on its way to the exchequer and applied to the service of the telegraphs the persons concerned in the gross and inexcused irregularities were mr monsell mr ayrton and the chancellor of the exchequer “there probably have been times” mr gladstone wrote to the queen aug 7 “when the three gentlemen who in their several positions have been chiefly to blame would have been summarily dismissed from your majesty’s service but on none of them could any illintent be charged two of them had among whatever errors of judgment done much and marked good service to the state” under the circumstances he could not resort to so severe a course without injustice and harshness “the recent exposures” mr gladstone wrote to lord russell “have been gall and wormwood to me from day to day” “ever since the failure of the irish university bill” he said “the government has been in a condition in which to say the least it has had no strength to spare and has stood in need of all the strength it could derive from internal harmony and vigorous administration” the post office scandal exposed to the broad light of day that neither harmony nor vigour existed or could be counted on it was evident that neither the postmaster nor the chancellor of the exchequer could remain where they were in submitting new arrangements to the queen mr gladstone said that he would gladly have spared her the irksome duty of considering them had it been “in his power either on the one side to leave unnoticed the scandals that have occurred or on the other to have tendered a general resignation or to have advised a dissolution of parliament” the hot weather and the lateness of the session made the house of commons disinclined for serious conflict still at the end of july various proceedings upon the scandals took place which mr gladstone described to the queen as of “a truly mortifying character” mr ayrton advanced doctrines of ministerial responsibility that could not for a moment be maintained and mr gladstone felt himself bound on the instant to disavow them292  sir robert phillimore gives a glimpse of him in these evil days—       july 24—gladstone dined here hastily very unwell and much     worn he talked about little else than bishop wilberforce’s     funeral and the ecclesiastical appeals in the judicature bill     29th—saw gladstone better but pale said the government deserved     a vote of censure on monsell and lowe’s account monsell ought to     resign but lowe he said ought for past services to be defended     30th—dined at gladstone’s radical mp’s  agreed that     government was tottering and that gladstone did everything     gladstone walks with a stick aug 7—an interview with     gladstone he was communicative a great reform of his government     has become necessary the treasury to be swept out he looked much     better   nothing at any time was so painful almost intolerably painful to mr gladstone as personal questions and cabinet reconstruction is made up of personal questions of the most trying and invidious kind “i have had a fearful week” he wrote to the duke of argyll aug 8 “but have come through a few behave oddly most perfectly well some incomparably well of these last i must name honoris causâ bright bruce and f cavendish” to mr bright he had written when the crisis first grew acute—       aug 2—you have seen the reports without doubt of what has     been going on you can hardly conceive the reality i apprehend     that the house of commons by its abstinence and forbearance must     be understood to have given us breathing time and space to     consider what can be done to renovate the government in something     like harmony and something like dignity this will depend greatly     upon men and partly upon measures changes in men there must be     and some without delay a lingering and discreditable death after     the life we have lived is not an ending to which we ought to     submit without effort and as an essential part of the best effort     that can be made i am most desirous to communicate with you here     i rely on your kindness to come up here only can i show you the     state of affairs which is most dangerous and yet not unhopeful   from the diary—       aug 1—saw lord f cavendish also lord granville lord     wolverton mr cardwell repeatedly on the crisis 2—an anxious     day the first step was taken cardwell broke to lowe the     necessity of his changing his office also i spoke to forster and     fortescue 4—a very anxious day of constant conversation and     reflection ending with an evening conclave 5—my day began with     dr clark rose at eleven wrote most of these carried much     powder and shot some were jack ketch and calcraft the public     executioner letters 6—incessant interviews much anxiety     respecting the queen’s delay in replying saw lord wolverton late     with her reply 9—to osborne a long and satisfactory audience of     hm attended the council and received a third time the seals of     my old office   this resumption of the seals of the exchequer which could no longer be left with mr lowe was forced upon mr gladstone by his colleagues from a fragmentary note he seems to have thought of mr goschen for the vacant post “but deferring to the wishes of others” he says “i reluctantly consented to become chancellor of the exchequer” the latest instance of a combination of this office with that of first lord of the treasury were canning in 1827 and peel in 18845293  the correspondence on this mass of distractions is formidable but luckily for us it is now mere burntout cinder the two protagonists of discord had been mr lowe and mr ayrton and we may as well leave them with a few sentences of mr gladstone upon the one and to the other—       mr ayrton he says has caused mr gladstone so much care and     labour on many occasions that if he had the same task to     encounter in the case of a few other members of the cabinet his     office would become intolerable but before a public servant of     this class can properly be dismissed there must be not only a     sufficient case against him but a case of which the sufficiency     can be made intelligible and palpable to the world some of his     faults are very serious yet he is as towards the nation an     upright assiduous and able functionary   to mr lowe who had become home secretary he writes aug 13—       i do not know whether the word “timid” was the right one for l——     but at any rate i will give you proof that i am not “timid”     though a coward in many respects i may be i always hold that     politicians are the men whom as a rule it is most difficult to     comprehend ie understand completely and for my own part i     never have thus understood or thought i understood above one or     two though here and there i may get hold of an isolated idea     about others such an idea comes to me about you i think the     clearness power and promptitude of your intellect are in one     respect a difficulty and a danger to you you see everything in a     burning almost a scorching light the case reminds me of an     incident some years back sir d brewster asked me to sit for my     photograph in a black frost and a half mist in edinburgh i     objected about the light he said this is the best light it is     all diffused not concentrated is not your light too much     concentrated does not its intensity darken the surroundings by     the surroundings i mean the relations of the thing not only to     other things but to persons as our profession obliges us     constantly to deal with persons in every question flesh and blood     are strong and real even if extraneous elements and we cannot     safely omit them from our thoughts      now after all this impudence let me try and do you a little more     justice you have held for a long time the most important office     of the state no man can do his duty in that office and be popular     while he holds it i could easily name the two worst chancellors     of the exchequer of the last forty years against neither of them     did i ever hear a word while they were in i might almost add nor     for them after they were out “blessed are ye when men shall     revile you” you have fought for the public tooth and nail you     have been under a storm of unpopularity but not a fiercer one     than i had to stand in 1860 when hardly any one dared to say a     word for me but certainly it was one of my best years of service     even though bad be the best of course i do not say that this     necessity of being unpopular should induce us to raise our     unpopularity to the highest point no doubt both in policy and in     christian charity it should make us very studious to mitigate and     abate the causes as much as we can this is easier for you than it     was for me as your temper is good and mine not good      while i am faultfinding let me do a little more and take     another scrap of paper for the purpose i took only a scrap     before as i was determined then not to “afflict you above     measure” i note then two things about you outstripping others     in the race you reach the goal or conclusion before them and     being there you assume that they are there also this is     unpopular you are unpopular this very day with a poor wretch     whom you have apprised that he has lost his seat and you have not     told him how again and lastly i think you do not get up all     things but allow yourself a choice as if politics were a     flowergarden and we might choose among the beds as lord     palmerston did who read foreign office and war papers and let     the others rust and rot this i think is partially true i do     not say of your reading but of your mental processes you will i     am sure forgive the levity and officiousness of this letter for     the sake of its intention and will believe me always and sincerely     yours   then at last he escaped from downing street to hawarden—       aug 11—off at 850 with a more buoyant spirit and greater     sense of relief than i have experienced for many years on this     the only pleasant act of moving to me in the circuit of the year     this gush is in proportion to the measure of the late troubles and     anxieties    ii   the reader will perhaps not thank me for devoting even a short page or two to a matter that made much clatter of tongue and pen in its day the points are technical minute and to be forgotten as quickly as possible but the thing was an episode though a trivial one enough in mr gladstone’s public life and paltry use was made of it in the way of groundless innuendo being first lord of the treasury he took besides the office of chancellor of the exchequer was this a fresh acceptance of a place of profit under the crown did he thereby come within the famous statute of anne and vacate his seat or was he protected by a provision in the act of 1867 to the effect that if any member had been duly reelected since his acceptance of any office referred to in the act of anne he should be free to accept any other such office without further reelection mr gladstone had been reelected after being first lord of the treasury was he free to accept the office of chancellor of the exchequer in addition without again submitting himself to his constituents the policy and object of the provision were obvious and they were notorious unluckily for good reasons not at all affecting this object mr disraeli inserted certain words the right construction of which in our present case became the subject of keen and copious contention the section that had been unmistakable before now ran that a member holding an office of profit should not vacate his seat by his subsequent acceptance of any other office “in lieu of and in immediate succession the one to the other”294 not a word was said in the debate on the clause as to the accumulation of offices and nobody doubted that the intention of parliament was simply to repeal the act of anne in respect of change of office by existing ministers was mr gladstone’s a case protected by this section was the act of 1867 which had been passed to limit the earlier statute still to be construed in these circumstances as extending it  unsuspected hares were started in every direction what is a first lord of the treasury is there such an office had it ever been named up to that time in a statute is the chancellor of the exchequer besides being something more also a commissioner of the treasury if he is and if the first lord is only the same and if there is no legal difference between the lords of the treasury does the assumption of the two parts by one minister constitute a case of immediate succession by one commissioner to another or is the minister in mr gladstone’s circumstances an indivisible personality as commissioner discharging two sets of duties then the precedents perceval was chancellor of the exchequer in 1809 when he accepted in addition the office of first lord with an increased salary and yet he was held not to have vacated his seat295 lord north in 1770 then chancellor of the exchequer was appointed first lord on the resignation of the duke of grafton and he at the same time retained his post of chancellor yet no writ was ordered and no reelection took place  into this discussion we need not travel what concerns us here is mr gladstone’s own share in the transaction the plain story of what proved a complex affair mr gladstone recounted to the speaker on august 16 in language that shows how direct and concise he could be when handling practical business—       i had already sent you a preliminary intimation on the subject of     my seat for greenwich before i received your letter of the 14th     i will now give you a more complete account of what has taken     place knowing only that the law had been altered with the view of     enabling the ministers to change offices without reelection and     that the combination of my two offices was a proper and common     one we had made no inquiry into the point of law nor imagined     there was any at the time when deferring to the wish of others i     reluctantly consented to become c of e on saturday last aug 9     when i was at osborne the question was opened to me i must     qualify what i have stated by saying that on friday afternoon some     one had started the question fully into view and it had been on     a summary survey put aside on monday i saw mr lambert who i     found had looked into it we talked of it fully and he undertook     to get the materials of a case together the act throws the     initiative upon me but as the matter seemed open to discussion i     felt that i must obtain the best assistance viz that of the law     officers i advisedly abstained from troubling or consulting sir     e may because you might have a subsequent and separate part to     take and might wish to refer to him also the blundering in the     newspapers showed that the question abounded in nice matter and     would be all the better understood from a careful examination of     precedents the law officers were out of town but the     solicitorgeneral jessel was to come up in the later part of the     week it was not possible in so limited a time to get a case into     perfect order still i thought that as the adverse argument lay     on the surface i had better have him consulted i have had no     direct communication with him but mr lambert with his usual     energy put together the principal materials and i jotted down all     that occurred to me yesterday mr lambert and my private     secretary mr gurdon who as well as the solicitor to the     treasury had given attention to the subject brought the matter     fully before the solicitorgeneral he has found himself able to     write a full opinion on the questions submitted to him 1 my     office as c of e is an office of profit 2 my commissionership     of the treasury under the new patent in preparation is an “other     office” under the meaning of the late act 3 i cannot be advised     to certify to you any avoidance of the seat had the opinion of     sir g jessel been adverse i should at once have ceased to urge     the argument on the act strong as it appears to me to be but in     point of form i should have done what i now propose to do viz     to have the case made as complete as possible and to obtain the     joint opinion of the law officers perhaps that of the chancellor     should be added here ends my narrative which is given only for     your information and to show that i have not been negligent in     this matter the act requiring me to proceed “forthwith”   speaker brand replied aug 18 that while speaking with reserve on the main point at issue he had no hesitation in saying that he thought mr gladstone was taking the proper course in securing the best legal advice in the matter and he did not know what more could be done under present circumstances  m151 the question put to jessel was “whether mr gladstone having accepted the office of chancellor of the exchequer is not under the circumstances stated protected by the provision contained in section 52 of the representation of the people act 1867 from vacating his seat” jessel answered “i am of opinion that he is so protected” “i may be wrong” this strong lawyer once said “and sometimes am but i have never any doubts” his reasons on this occasion were as trenchant as his conclusion next came coleridge the attorneygeneral he wrote to mr gladstone on sept 1 1873—       i have now gone carefully through the papers as to your seat and     looked at the precedents and though i admit that the case is a     curious one and the words of the statute not happily chosen yet     i have come clearly and without doubt to the same conclusion as     jessel and i shall be quite prepared if need be to argue the     case in that sense in parliament still it may be very proper as     you yourself suggest that you should have a written and formal     opinion of the law officers and bowen upon it296   selborne volunteered the opposite view aug 21 and did not see how it could be contended that mr gladstone being still a commissioner of the treasury under the then existing commission took the office of the chancellor with increase of pay in lieu of and in immediate succession to the other office which he still continued to hold a day or two later selborne however sent to mr gladstone a letter addressed to himself by baron bramwell in this letter that most capable judge and strongheaded man said “as a different opinion is i know entertained i can’t help saying that i think it clear mr gladstone has not vacated his seat his case is within neither the spirit nor the letter of the statute” he then puts his view in the plain english of which he was a master the lord advocate now lord young went with the chancellor and against the english law officers lowe at first thought that the seat was not vacated and then he thought that it was “sir erskine may” says mr gladstone feb 2 1874 “has given a strong opinion that my seat is full” well might the minister say that he thought “the trial of this case would fairly take as long as tichborne” on september 21 the chancellor while still holding to his own opinion wrote to mr gladstone—       you have followed the right course especially in a question which     directly concerns the house of commons in obtaining the opinion     of the law officers of the crown but having taken this proper     course and being disposed yourself to agree to the conclusions of     your official advisers you are clearly free from all personal     fault if you decide to act upon those conclusions and leave the     house when it meets to deal with them in way either of assent or     dissent as it may think fit   coleridge and jessel went on to the bench and sir henry james and sir william harcourt were brought up from below the gangway to be attorney and solicitor in november the new law officers were requested to try their hands taking the brilliant and subtle charles bowen into company they considered the case but did not venture dec 1 beyond the singularly shy proposition that strong arguments might be used both in favour of and against the view that the seat was vacated  meanwhile the times had raised the question immediately aug 11 though not in adverse language the unslumbering instinct of party had quickly got upon a scent and two keennosed sleuth hounds of the opposition four or five weeks after mr gladstone had taken the seals of the exchequer sent to the speaker a certificate in the usual form sept 17 stating the vacancy at greenwich and requesting him to issue a writ for a new election the speaker reminded them in reply that the law governing the issue of writs during the recess in cases of acceptance of office required notification to him from the member accepting and he had received no such notification297 everybody knew that in case of an election mr gladstone’s seat was not safe though when the time came he was in fact elected the final state and the outlook could not be better described than in a letter from lord halifax to mr gladstone dec 9—       lord halifax to mr gladstone      dec 9 1873—on thinking over the case as to your seat i     really think it is simple enough i will put my ideas shortly for     your benefit or you may burn them you did not believe that you     had vacated your seat on accepting the office of chancellor of the     exchequer and you did not send notice to the speaker as required     by the act of 1858 were you right the solicitorgeneral said     that you were in a deliberate opinion the attorneygeneral     concurred the present law officers consider it so very doubtful     that they will not give an opinion the speaker either from not     having your notice or having doubts has not ordered a new writ     these are the facts what should you do up to the meeting of     parliament you clearly must act as if there was no doubt if you     do not you almost admit being wrong you must assume yourself to     be right that you are justified in the course which you have     taken and act consistently on that view when parliament meets i     think the proper course would be for the speaker to say that he     had received a certificate of vacancy from two members but not     the notice from the member himself and having doubts he referred     the matter to the house according to the act this ensures the     priority of the question and calls on you to explain your not     having sent the notice you state the facts as above place     yourself in the hands of the house and withdraw i agree with     what bright said that the house of commons will deal quite fairly     in such a case a committee will be appointed i don’t think it     can last very long and you will be absent during its sitting no     important business can be taken during your absence and i do not     know that any evil will ensue from shortening the period of     business before the budget they may vote estimates or take minor     matters   this sensible view of lord halifax and mr bright may be set against lord selborne’s dogmatic assertion that a dissolution was the only escape as for his further assertion about his never doubting that this was the determining cause of the dissolution i can only say that in the mass of papers connected with the greenwich seat and the dissolution there is no single word in one of them associating in any way either topic with the other mr gladstone acted so promptly in the affair of the seat that both the speaker of the house of commons and lord selborne himself said that no fault could be found with him his position before the house was therefore entirely straightforward finally mr gladstone gave an obviously adequate and sufficient case for the dissolution both to the queen and to the cabinet and stated to at least three of his colleagues what was “the determining cause” and this was not the greenwich seat but something wholly remote from it298    iii   the autumn recess began with attendance at balmoral of which a glimpse or two remain—       to mrs gladstone      balmoral aug 22 1873—the queen in a long conversation asked     me today about you at holyhead she talked of many matters and     made me sit down because odd to say i had a sudden touch of my     enemy yesterday afternoon which made me think it prudent to beg     off from dining with her and keep on my back taking a strong dose     of sal volatile the queen had occasion to speak about the     crown princess lauded her talents did not care a pin for her     the queen’s opinion used to care only for that of her     father      aug 24—today i had a long talk nothing can be better than     her humour she is going to fort william on the 8th i leave on     saturday but if i make my highland walk it cannot be till monday     and all next week will probably be consumed in getting me home      aug 27—i enclose a copy of my intimation to the queen the     engagement of his eldest daughter which has drawn forth in a     few minutes the accompanying most charming letter from her i     think the original of this should be given to agnes herself as     she will think it a great treasure we keeping a copy is it not a     little odd on our part more than his that at least so far as i     am concerned we have allowed this great aye to be said without a     single word on the subject of the means of support forthcoming it     is indeed a proceeding worthy of the times of the acts of the     apostles you perhaps know a little more than i do your family     were not very worldly minded people but you will remember that     before our engagement stephen was spirited up most properly to     put a question to me about means yesterday i was not so much     struck at hearing nothing on the subject of any sublunary     particular but lo again your letter of today arrives with all     about the charms of the orphanage but not a syllable on beef and     mutton bread and butter which after all cannot be altogether     dispensed with   of this visit lord granville wrote to him sept 20 “the queen told me last night that she had never known you so remarkably agreeable” the journey closed with a rather marked proof of bodily soundness in a man nearly through his sixtyfourth year thus recorded in his diary—       aug 25—at balmoral walked thirteen miles quite fresh     26—walked 8½ miles in 2 h 10 m sept 1—off at 915 from     invercauld to castleton and derry lodge driving from the lodge     at 1115 thirtythree miles to kingussie on foot half an hour     for luncheon 14 hour waiting for the ponies the road so rough     on the hill touched a carriageable road at 5 the top at 3 very     grand hill views floods of rain on speyside good hotel at     kingussie but sorely disturbed by rats   “think” he wrote to his daughter mary from naworth “of my walking a good three and thirty miles last monday some of it the roughest ground i ever passed” he was always wont to enjoy proofs of physical vigour never forgetting how indispensable it is in the equipment of the politician for the athletics of public life on his return home he resumed the equable course of life associated with that happy place though political consultations intruded—       sept 6—settled down again at hawarden where a happy family     party gathered today 13—finished the long and sad but     profoundly interesting task of my letter to miss hopescott on     her father also sent her father’s letters 105 to her we     finished cutting down a great beech our politicians arrived     conversations with bright with wolverton with granville and     with all three till long past twelve when i prayed to leave off     for the sake of the brain 14—church morning and evening a     stiff task for a half exhausted brain but i cannot desist from a     sacred task conversation with lord granville lord wolverton mr     bright 15—church 8½ am spent the forenoon in conclave till     two after a preliminary conversation with bright spent the     evening also in conclave we have covered a good deal of     ground cut down the halfcut alder 16—final conversation     with granville with

how completely in the press of turbid affairs he could fling off the load and at once awake afresh the thoughts and associations that in truth made up his inmost life  m152 next came the autumn cabinets with all their embarrassments so numerous that one minister tossed a scrap across the table to another “we ought to have impeached dizzy for not taking office last spring” disraeli had at least done them one service an election took place at bath in october the conservative leader wrote a violent letter in support of the conservative candidate “for nearly five years” said mr disraeli “the present ministers have harassed every trade worried every profession and assailed or menaced every class institution and species of property in the country occasionally they have varied this state of civil warfare by perpetrating some job which outraged public opinion or by stumbling into mistakes which have been always discreditable and sometimes ruinous all this they call a policy and seem quite proud of it but the country has i think made up its mind to close this career of plundering and blundering”300 mr gladstone described this curious outburst as “mr disraeli’s incomparable stroke on our behalf” and in fact its effect on public opinion was to send the liberal candidate to the head of the poll but the victory at bath stood solitary in the midst of reverses  as for the general legislative business of the coming session mr gladstone thought it impossible to take up the large subject of the extension of the county franchise but they might encourage mr trevelyan to come forward with it on an early day and give him all the help they could still the board was bare the meal too frugal they were afraid of proposing a change in the laws affecting the inheritance of land or reform of london government or a burials bill or a county government bill the home secretary was directed to draw up a bill for a group of difficult questions as to employers and employed no

because it     everywhere takes for granted all sorts of knowing intrigues and     puts little artful dramas in the place of truth there is less     premeditation in human affairs and their course is more natural     than people commonly believe    i   in the summer of 1873 before leaving london for hawarden mr gladstone sent for the chairman of the board of inland revenue and for the head of the finance department of the treasury he directed them to get certain information into order for him his requests at once struck these experienced officers with a surmise that he was nursing some design of dealing with the incometax here are two entries from his diary—       aug 11 1873—saw mr cardwell to whom at the war office i     told in deep secrecy my ideas of the possible finance of next     year based upon the abolition of incometax and sugar duties     with partial compensation from spirit and death duties sept     29—wrote a rough mem and computation for budget of next year i     want eight millions to handle   so much for the charitable tale that he only bethought him of the incometax when desperately hunting for a card to play at a general election  the prospect was dubious and dark to mr bright he wrote from hawarden aug 14—       my dear bright—let us bid farewell to misters  as to the     parliamentary future of the question of education we had better     talk when we meet i remember your saying well and wisely how we     should look to the average opinion of the party what we want at     present is a positive force to carry us onward as a body i do     not see that this can be got out of local taxation or out of the     suffrage whether we act in that matter or not and individually     i am more yes than no or out of education it may possibly i     think be had out of finance of course i cannot as yet see my     way on that subject but until it is cleared nothing else will to     me be clear if it can be worked into certain shapes it may     greatly help to mould the rest at least for the time i think the     effect of the reconstruction may be described as follows first     we have you secondly we have emerged from the discredit and     disgrace of the exposures by an administration of mild penal     justice which will be complete all round when monsell has been     disposed of thirdly we have now before us a clean stage for the     consideration of measures in the autumn we must i think have a     good bill of fare or none if we differ on the things to be done     this may end us in a way at least not dishonourable if we agree     on a good plan it must come to good whether we succeed or fail     with it such are my crude reflections and such my outlook for     the future let me again say how sensible i am of the kindness     friendship and public spirit with which you have acted in the     whole of this matter   in the early part of the year his mind was drawing towards a decision of moment on january 8 1874 he wrote a letter to lord granville and the copy of it is docketed “first idea of dissolution” it contains a full examination of the actual case in which they found themselves it is instructive on more than one constitutional point and it gives an entirely intelligible explanation of a step that was often imputed to injurious and lowminded motives—       hawarden jan 8 1874—the signs of weakness multiply and for     some time have multiplied upon the government in the loss of     control over the legislative action of the house of lords the     diminution of the majority in the house of commons without its     natural compensation in increase of unity and discipline and the     almost unbroken series of defeats at single elections in the     country301 in truth the government is approaching though i     will not say it has yet reached the condition in which it will     have ceased to possess that amount of power which is necessary for     the dignity of the crown and the welfare of the country and in     which it might be a godsend if some perfectly honourable     difference of opinion among ourselves on a question requiring     immediate action were to arise and to take such a course as to     release us collectively from the responsibilities of office      the general situation being thus unfavourable the ordinary     remedies are not available a ministry with a majority and with     that majority not in rebellion could not resign on account of     adverse manifestations even of very numerous single     constituencies without making a precedent and constitutionally a     bad precedent and only a very definite and substantive difficulty     could warrant resignation without dissolution after the     proceedings of the opposition in march last when they or at any     rate their leaders and their whips brought the queen into a     ministerial crisis and deserted her when there if then we turn     to consider dissolution what would be its results in my opinion     the very best that could happen would be that we should come back     with a small majority composed of irish home rulers and a decided     minority without them while to me it seems very doubtful whether     even with home rulers counted in we should command a full half of     the house of commons in a word dissolution means either     immediate death or at the best death a little postponed and the     party either way shattered for the time for one i am anxious to     continue where we are because i am very loath to leave the party     in its present menacing condition without having first made every     effort in our power to avert this public mischief      if i have made myself intelligible up to this point the question     that arises is can we make out such a course of policy for the     session either in the general conduct of business or in some     departments and by certain measures as will with reasonable     likelihood reanimate some portion of that sentiment in our favour     which carried us in a manner so remarkable through the election of     1868 i discuss the matter now in its aspect towards party it is     not necessary to make an argument to show that our option can only     be among things all of which are sound in principle first then     i do not believe that we can find this recovery of vital force in     our general administration of public business as men     notwithstanding the advantage drawn from bright’s return the     nation appears to think that it has had enough of us that our     lease is out it is a question of measures then can we by any     measures materially mend the position of the party for an     impending election      looking to legislation there are but three subjects which appear     to me to be even capable of discussion in the view i have     presented they are local taxation the county suffrage and     finance i am convinced it is not in our power to draw any great     advantage as a party from the subject of local taxation     equally strong is my opinion with respect to the party bearings of     the question of the county franchise we have indeed already     determined not to propose it as a government had we done so a     case would have opened at once comfortably furnished not with men     opposing us on principle like a part of those who opposed in     1866 but with the men of pretext and the men of disappointment     with intriguers and with egotists and i believe that in the     present state of opinion they would gain their end by something     like the old game of playing redistribution against the     franchise      can we then look to finance as supplying what we want this is the     only remaining question it does not admit as yet of a positive     answer but it admits conditionally of a negative answer it is     easy to show what will prevent our realising our design through     the finance of the year we cannot do it unless the circumstances     shall be such as to put it in our power by the possession of a     very wide margin to propose something large and strong and     telling upon both the popular mind and the leading elements of the     constituency we cannot do it without running certain risks of     the kind that were run in the budget of 1853 i mean without some     impositions as well as remissions of taxes we cannot do it     without a continuance of the favourable prospects of harvest and     of business lastly we cannot do it unless we can frame our     estimates in a manner to show our desire to adhere to the     principles of economy which we proposed and applied with such     considerable effect in 186870 but subject to the fulfilment of     these conditions my opinion is that we can do it can frame a     budget large enough and palpably beneficial enough not only to do     much good to the country but sensibly to lift the party in the     public view and estimation and this although a serious sum will     have to be set apart even in the present year for the claims of     local taxation      if we can get from threequarters of a million upwards towards a     million off the naval and military estimates jointly then as far     as i can judge we shall have left the country no reason to     complain and may proceed cheerily with our work though we should     not escape the fire of the opposition for having failed to     maintain the level of feb 1870 which indeed we never announced     as our ultimatum of reduction i have had no communication with     those of our colleagues who would most keenly desire reductions i     might say with any one i will only add that i think a broad     difference of opinion among us on such a question as this would be     a difference of the kind which i described near the opening of     this letter as what might be in certain circumstances however     unwelcome in itself an escape from a difficulty otherwise     incapable of solution      let me now wind up this long story by saying that my desire in     framing it has been simply to grasp the facts and to set aside     illusions which appear to me to prevail among sections of the     liberal party nowhere so much as in that section which believes     itself to be the most enlightened if we can only get a correct     appreciation of the position i do not think we shall fail in     readiness to suit our action to it but i am bound to confess     myself not very sanguine if the best come to the best as to     immediate results though full of confidence if we act aright as     to the future and early reward    ii   m153 in notes written in the last year of his life mr gladstone adds a detail of importance to the considerations set out in the letter to lord granville the reader will have observed that among the conditions required for his operation on the incometax he names economic estimates in this quarter he tells us grave difficulties arose—       no trustworthy account of the dissolution of parliament which took     place early in 1874 has ever been published when i proposed the     dissolution to the cabinet they acceded to it without opposition     or i think even discussion the actual occasion of the measure     was known i think only to lord granville and lord cardwell with     myself it having a sufficient warrant from other sources      in 1871 the year of the abolition of purchase and other important     army reforms i had in full understanding with cardwell made a     lengthened speech in which i referred to the immediate     augmentations of military expenditure which the reforms demanded     but held out to the house of commons the prospect of compensating     abatements at early dates through the operation of the new system     of relying considerably upon reserves for imperial defence      when cardwell laid before me at the proper time in view of the     approaching session his proposed estimates for 18745 i was     strongly of opinion that the time had arrived for our furnishing     by a very moderate reduction of expenditure on the army some     earnest of the reality of the promise made in 1871 which had been     so efficacious in procuring the enlargement that we had then     required cardwell though not an extravagant minister objected     to my demand of i think £200000 i conferred with granville     who without any direct knowledge of the subject took my side     and thought cardwell would give way but he continued to resist     and viewing the age of the parliament i was thus driven to the     idea of dissolution for i regarded the matter as virtually     involving the whole question of the value of our promises an     anticipation which has proved to be correct cardwell entered     readily into the plan of dissolving and moreover thought that if     my views carried the day with the constituencies this would     enable him to comply   the papers in my hands confirm mr gladstone’s recollection on this part of the transaction except that mr goschen then at the head of the admiralty was to some extent in the same position as mr cardwell the prime minister was in active controversy with both the great spending departments and with little chance of prevailing it was this controversy that opened the door for immediate dissolution though the general grounds for dissolution at some near time were only too abundant here is his note of the position—in a minute addressed to mr cardwell and mr goschen—       jan 22 1874—we arrived yesterday at the conclusion that     apart from this or that shade of view as to exact figure of the     estimates the measure now proposed stood well on its own general     grounds this being so after consulting lord granville and     indeed at his suggestion i have in a preparatory letter to the     queen founded myself entirely on general grounds this being so i     would propose to consider the point raised between us as one     adjourned though with a perfect knowledge in each of our minds as     to the views of the others my statement to the cabinet must be on     the same basis as my statement to the queen the actual decision     of the estimates would stand over from tomorrow’s cabinet until     we saw our way as to their position and as to the time for their     production i am sure i might reckon on your keeping the future as     far as possible open and unprejudiced by contracts for works or     for building or construction any reference to economy which i     make tomorrow will be in general terms such as i propose to use     in an address if i have made myself clear and you approve please     to signify it on this paper or to speak to me as you may prefer     i am reluctant to go out with my chest still tender in the fog   cardwell in the few words of his minute in reply makes no objection mr goschen says “i quite take the same view as you do indeed i had proposed myself to ask you whether what had passed between us had not better remain entirely confidential for the present as it is best not to state differences where the statement of them is not indispensable”  the diary for these important days is interesting—       jan17 ’74—the prospects of agreement with the two departments     on estimates are for the present bad 18—this day i thought of     dissolution told bright of it in evening at dinner told     granville and wolverton all seemed to approve my first thought     of it was as an escape from a difficulty i soon saw on reflection     that it was the best thing in itself 19—confined all day in bed     with tightness on the chest much physicking 20—bed all day i     spent the chief part of the day and evening in reflection on our     “crisis” and then in preparing a letter to go to the queen for     her information at once and a long address for an unnamed     constituency—almost a pamphlet—setting out the case of the     government in an immediate appeal to the country 21—altered and     modified letter to the queen which went off came down at two     much conversation today on the question of my own seat     23—cabinet 12144 address further amended there on partial     perusal in evening corrected proofs of address which runs well     a very busy stirring day of incessant action   in the letter of jan 21 to the queen mr gladstone recapitulates the general elements of difficulty and apprises her majesty that it will be his duty at the meeting of the cabinet fixed for the 23rd to recommend his colleagues humbly and dutifully to advise an immediate dissolution as the best means of putting an end to the disadvantage and the weakness of a false position he trusts that the queen may be pleased to assent the queen jan 22 acknowledged the receipt of his letter “with some surprise” as she had understood him to say when last at windsor that he did not think of recommending a dissolution until the end of the session or later but she expressed her “full appreciation of the difficulties of mr gladstone’s position” and assented thinking that “in the present circumstances it would be desirable to obtain an expression of the national opinion”  the next day 23rd the cabinet met and mr gladstone in the evening reported the proceedings to the queen—       to the queen      jan 23 1874— mr gladstone laid before the cabinet a     pretty full outline of the case as to the weakness of the     government since the crisis of last march and the increase of     that weakness especially of late from the unfavourable character     of local indications as to the false position in which both the     crown and the house of commons are placed when there can be no     other government than the one actually existing finally as to     the present calls of business and prospects of the country     especially as to its finance which are such as in mr gladstone’s     judgment to warrant the presentation of a very favourable picture     of what may be effected with energy and prudence during the     present year in this picture is included as mr gladstone on     wednesday intimated might be the case the total repeal of the     incometax the cabinet unanimously concurred upon a review of     its grounds in the wisdom of the proposed measure it is as yet     profoundly secret but tomorrow morning it will be placed before     the world with a lengthened and elaborate exposition in the shape     of an address from mr gladstone to his constituents at greenwich     there can be no doubt that a large portion of the public will at     first experience that emotion of surprise which your majesty so     very naturally felt on receiving mr gladstone’s letter but     judging from such indications as have reached them the cabinet     are disposed to anticipate that this course will be approved by     all those who are in any degree inclined to view their general     policy with sympathy or favour large portions and the most     important portions of mr gladstone’s address were read to and     considered by the cabinet and it was in some respects amended at     the suggestion of his esteemed colleagues it is however so     framed as not to commit them equally with himself except only as     to the remissions of taxes and aid to local rates contemplated in     the finance of the year this method of stating generally the case     of the government in substance corresponds to the proceedings of     sir r peel in 18345 when he addressed the electors of tamworth     before concluding mr gladstone will humbly offer to your majesty     a brief explanation when he last adverted to the duration of the     present parliament his object was to remind your majesty of the     extreme point to which that duration might extend when he had the     honour of seeing your majesty at windsor302 the course of the     local elections had been more favourable and mr gladstone had     not abandoned the hope of retaining sufficient strength for the     due conduct of affairs in the present house on this question the     events of the last few weeks and the prospects of the present     moment have somewhat tended to turn the scale in his mind and that     of his colleagues303 but finally it was not within his power     until the fourth quarter of the financial year had well begun to     forecast the financial policy and measures which form a necessary     and indeed the most vital part of the matter to be stated to the     public immediately after he had been able sufficiently to ripen     his own thoughts on the matter he did not scruple to lay them     before your majesty and your majesty had yourself in one sense     contributed to the present conclusion by forcibly pointing out to     mr gladstone on one or more occasions that in the event of     difficulty under the present peculiar circumstances no     alternative remained except a dissolution the mild weather is     very favourable to mr gladstone and if as he has prayed there     shall be a council on monday he hopes to have the honour of     coming down to osborne   to his eldest son he wrote on the following day—       we here of the cabinet304 and the whips are in admirable     spirits we dissolve on finance the surplus will be over five     millions we promise as in our judgment practicable—1 pecuniary     aid to local taxation but with reform of it 2 repeal of the     incometax 3 some great remission in the class of articles of     consumption this last remission probably means sugar but     nothing is to be said by any member of the government as to choice     of the article we make it a question of confidence on the     prospective budget as far as we can judge friends will much     approve our course although for the public there may at first be     surprise and the enemy will be furious    iii   the prime minister’s manifesto to his constituents at greenwich was elaborate and sustained in substance it did no more than amplify the various considerations that he had set forth in his letter to lord granville the pith of it was a promise to diminish local taxation and to repeal the incometax at the same time marked relief was to be given to the general consumer in respect of articles of popular consumption one effective passage dealt with the charge that the liberal party had endangered the institutions of the country “it is time” said mr gladstone “to test this trite and vague allegation there has elapsed a period of forty or more exactly fortythree years since the liberal party acquired the main direction of public affairs this followed another period of about forty years beginning with the outbreak of the revolutionary war during which there had been an almost unbroken rule of their opponents who claimed and were reputed to be the great preservers of the institutions of the country” he then invited men to judge by general results and declared that the forty years of tory rule closing in 1830 left institutions weaker than it had found them whereas the liberal term of forty years left throne laws and institutions not weaker but much stronger the address was a fine bold composition but perhaps it would have been more effective with a public that was impatient and out of humour if it had been shorter  m154 the performance was styled by his rival “a prolix narrative” but it is said that in spite of this mr disraeli read it with much alarm he thought its freshness and boldness would revive mr gladstone’s authority and carry the elections his own countermanifesto was highly artificial he launched sarcasms about the greenwich seat about too much energy in domestic legislation and too little in foreign policy about an act of folly or of ignorance rarely equalled in dealing with the straits of malacca though for that matter not one elector in a hundred thousand had ever heard of this nefarious act while absolving the prime minister himself “certainly at present” from hostility to our national institutions and the integrity of the empire he drew a picture of unfortunate adherents—some assailed the monarchy others impugned the independence of the house of lords while others would relieve parliament altogether from any share in the government of one portion of the united kingdom others again urged mr gladstone to pursue his peculiar policy by disestablishing the anglican as he has despoiled the irish church even trusted colleagues in his cabinet openly concurred with them in their desire altogether to thrust religion from the place which it ought to occupy in national education what is remarkable in disraeli’s address is that to the central proposal of his adversary he offered no objection as for remission of taxation he said that would be the course of any party or any ministry as for the promise of reduced local burdens and the abolition of the incometax why these “were measures which the conservative party have always favoured and which the prime minister and his friends have always opposed”  by critics of the peevish school who cry for better bread than can be made of political wheat mr gladstone’s proffer to do away with the incometax has been contumeliously treated as dangling a shameful bait such talk is surely pharisaic stuff as if in 1852 disraeli in his own address had not declared that the government would have for its first object to relieve the agricultural interest from certain taxes was that a bribe as if peel in 18345 had not set forth in the utmost detail all the measures that he intended to submit to parliament if the constituencies would give him a majority was this to drive an unprincipled bargain as if every minister does not always go to the country on promises and as if the material of any promise could be more legitimate than a readjustment of taxation the proceeding was styled a sordid huckstering of a financial secret for a majority why was it more sordid to seek a majority for abolition of the incometax than it was sordid in peel in 1841 to seek a majority for corn laws or in whigs and manchester men to seek to win upon free trade why is it an ignoble bargain to promise to remove the tax from income and pure statesmanship to remove the tax from bread “give us a majority” said mr gladstone “and we will do away with incometax lighten local burdens and help to free the breakfast table” if people believed him what better reason could they have than such a prospect as this for retaining him in the place of their chief ruler    iv   parliament was dissolved on january 26 and the contending forces instantly engaged mr gladstone did not spare himself—       jan 26 ’74—834534 to osborne audience of hm who     quite comprehends the provisional character of the position      boundless newspaper reading 28—25 to greenwich spoke an hour     to 5000 an enthusiastic meeting but the general prospects are     far from clear305 31—woolwich meeting the meeting disturbed     by design was strangely brought round again feb 2—third great     meeting and speech of an hour at new cross for deptford much     enthusiasm and fair order 3—many telegrams and much conversation     with granville and wolverton in the evening the general purport     was first indifferent then bad my own election for greenwich     after boord the distiller is more like a defeat than a victory     though it places me in parliament again a wakeful night but more     i believe from a little strong coffee drunk incautiously than     from the polls which i cannot help and have done all in my power     to mend   the greenwich seat the cause of such long perturbation was saved after all but as mr gladstone wrote to a defeated colleague “in some points of view it is better to be defeated outright than to be pitched in like me at greenwich” the numbers were boord c 6193 gladstone l 5968 liardet c 5561 langley l 5255  m155 the conservative reaction was general scotland and wales still returned a liberal majority but even in these strongholds a breach was made—a net loss of 3 in wales of 9 in scotland from the english counties 145 tories were returned and no more than 27 liberals a loss of 13 in the greater boroughs hitherto regarded as staunchly ministerial some of the most populous returned tories the metropolitan elections went against the government and 7 seats were lost—three in the city one in westminster in both cases by immense majorities the net liberal loss in the english boroughs was 32 in england and wales the tory majority was 105 in great britain it stood at 83 when all was over the new house contained a conservative majority of 48 or on another estimate of 50 but really in mr gladstone’s words “of much greater strength”  numbers as mr gladstone said afterwards did not exhibit the whole measure of the calamity an extraordinary portent arose in that quarter from which so many portents spring “the liberal majority reckoned to have been returned from ireland was at once found to be illusory out of the 105 members the liberals were little more than a dozen the period immediately following the church act and land act had been chosen as one appropriate for a formal severance of the irish national party from the general body of british liberals their number was no less than fiftyeight an actual majority of the irish representation they assumed the name of home rulers and established a separate parliamentary organisation on some questions of liberal opinion cooperation was still continued but as regards the party the weight of the home rulers clearly told more in favour of the conservative ministry than of the opposition and the liberal party would have been stronger not weaker had the entire body been systematically absent”306 before the election was over mr chichester fortescue had warned him that he expected defeat in the county of louth for which he had sat ever since 1847 the defeat came mr gladstone wrote to him feb 11—       i receive with great concern your dark prognostication of the     result of the louth election it would be so painful in a public     view with regard to the gratitude of irishmen that i will still     hope for a better result but with reference to the latter part of     your letter i at once write to say that in the double event of     your rejection and your wish i consider your claim to a peerage     indisputable it would be hard to name the man who has done for     ireland all that you have done or any man that knew the greatest     irish questions as you know them   mr parnell by the way was not elected for meath until april 1875    v   as the adverse verdict became more and more emphatic mr gladstone stated to the queen feb 13 what was the bias of his mind on the question whether the expiring government should await its sentence from parliament he had no doubt he said that this course was the one most agreeable to usage and to the rules of parliamentary government any departure from it could only be justified upon exceptional grounds he was not however clear that this case like that of 1868 was to be treated as exceptional partly by reason of prevalent opinion partly because it should be considered what is fair to an incoming administration with reference to the business especially the financial business of the year lord granville from the first seems to have been against waiting for formal decapitation by the new house of commons to him mr gladstone wrote feb 7—       i presume you will answer bismarck’s kind telegram please to     mention me in your reply or not as you think proper as to the     impending crisis of our fate one important element i admit will     be the feeling of the party i have asked peel whose first     feeling seems rather to be with you to learn what he can i tend     to harden in my own view principle and precedent seeming to me     alike clear there are four precedents of our own time—1835 1841     1852 1859 under three ministers the only case the other way is     that of 1868 of which the circumstances were altogether peculiar     but i admit it to be very doubtful whether we should get beyond     the address on the other hand i admit freely that i have no title     to press my view beyond a certain point   m156 “it is parliament” he argued “not the constituencies that ought to dismiss the government and the proper function of the house of commons cannot be taken from it without diminishing somewhat in dignity and authority” there would be reproach either way he said either it would be clinging to office or it would be running away to run away was in every circumstance of politics the thing to mr gladstone most unbearable according to sir robert phillimore feb 8 “gladstone would have met parliament but his colleagues objected though it seems they would have stood by him if he had pressed them to do so but as he did not mean or was not going to fight in the van of opposition he thought it unfair to press them”       feb 16 ’74—cabinet dinner 812 it went well i did something     towards snapping the ties and winding out of the coil     conversation afterwards with granville on the flags up and down     then with wolverton to bed at 134 but lay three hours awake     rare with me with an overwrought brain  17—12½6 went to     windsor and on behalf of the cabinet resigned took with me     merchant of venice and thomas à kempis each how admirable in     its way307 20—went by 510 to windsor final audience and     kissed hands her majesty very kind the topics of conversation     were of course rather limited 21—i cleared my room in downing     street and bade it farewell giving up my keys except the cabinet     key 28—set aside about 300 vols of pamphlets for the shambles     march 3—i have given up all my keys quitted downing street a     week ago not an official box remains but i have still the daily     visit of a kind private secretary when that drops all is over     5—hamilton paid me his last visit tomorrow i encounter my own     correspondence singlehanded   the queen repeated a former proposal of a peerage in returning some submissions for her approval she wished “likewise to record her offer to mr gladstone of a mark of her recognition of his services which however he declines from motives which she fully appreciates” mr gladstone writes to his brother sir thomas feb 13—       accept my best thanks for your kind note of yesterday my reply to     the queen was first made twelve months ago when we proposed to     resign simply from the failure of a great measure in h of c i     repeated it this year with similar expressions of gratitude but     with the remark that even if my mind had been open on the     question i did not think i could have accepted anything while     under that national condemnation which has been emphatically     enough pronounced at the elections i may be wrong in my view of     the matter generally but i can only judge for the best i do not     see that i am wanted or should be of use in the house of lords     and there would be more discrepancy between rank and fortune     which is a thing on the whole rather to be deprecated on the     other hand i know that the line i have marked out for myself in     the h of c is one not altogether easy to hold but i have every     disposition to remain quiet there and shall be very glad if i can     do so    vi   letters from two of his colleagues explain the catastrophe the shrewd lord halifax says to him feb 12—       as far as i can make out people are frightened—the masters were     afraid of their workmen manufacturers afraid of strikes     churchmen afraid of the nonconformists many afraid of what is     going on in france and spain—and in very unreasoning fear have all     taken refuge in conservatism ballot enabled them to do this     without apparently deserting their principles and party things in     this country as elsewhere are apt to run for a time in opposite     directions the reaction from the quiet of palmerston’s government     gave you strength to remove four or five oldstanding abuses which     nobody had ventured to touch for years the feelings of those who     suffer from the removal of abuses are always stronger than those     of the general public who are benefited gratitude for the reform     bill and its sequel of improvements hardly gave a liberal majority     in 1835 and gratitude for the removal of the irish church     purchase etc has not given us a majority in 1874   m157 mr bright wrote to him that as things had turned out it would perhaps have been wiser first to secure the budget with that and better organisation the result might have been better three or six months later in lancashire said bright publicans and irishmen had joined together one for delirium tremens and the other for religious education the 25th clause and mr forster’s obstinacy he added had done much to wreck the ship mr gladstone’s own diagnosis was not very different to his brother robertson he wrote feb 6—       for many years in the house of commons i have had more fighting     than any other man for the last five years i have had it almost     all and of it a considerable part has been against those     “independent” liberals whose characters and talents seem to be     much more appreciated by the press and general public than the     characters and talents of quieter members of the party i do not     speak of such men as —— who leave office or otherwise find     occasion to vindicate their independence and vote against us on     the questions immediately concerned these men make very little     noise and get very little applause but there is another and more     popular class of independent liberals who have been represented by     the daily news and who have been one main cause of the weakness     of the government though they generally and their organ have     rallied to us too late during the election we have never     recovered from the blow which they helped to strike on the irish     education bill      but more immediately operative causes have determined the     elections i have no doubt what is the principal we have been     borne down in a torrent of gin and beer next to this has been the     action of the education act of 1870 and the subsequent     controversies many of the roman catholics have voted against us     because we are not denominational and many of the dissenters have     at least abstained from voting because we are doubtless there     have been other minor agencies but these are the chief ones the     effect must be our early removal from office for me that will be     a very great change for i do not intend to assume the general     functions of leader of the opposition and my great ambition or     design will be to spend the remainder of my days if it please     god in tranquillity and at any rate in freedom from political     strife   when a short idle attempt was made in the new parliament to raise a debate upon the date and circumstances of the dissolution disraeli used language rightly called by mr gladstone “generous” “the right honourable gentleman’s friends” he said “were silent and i must confess i admire their taste and feeling if i had been a follower of a parliamentary chief as eminent even if i thought he had erred i should have been disposed rather to exhibit sympathy than to offer criticism i should remember the great victories which he had fought and won i should remember his illustrious career its continuous success and splendour not its accidental or even disastrous mistakes”308                    ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐  one word upon the place of this election in our financial history in 1874 the prosperity of the country and the movement of the revenue gave an opportunity for repeal of the incometax that opportunity never recurred the election of 1874 was the fall of the curtain the play that had begun in 1842 came to its last scene it marked the decision of the electorate that the incometax—introduced in time of peace by peel and continued by mr gladstone for the purpose of simplifying the tariff and expanding trade—should be retained for general objects of government and should be a permanent element of our finance it marked at the same time the prospect of a new era of indefinitely enlarged expenditure with the incometax as a main engine for raising ways and means whether this decision was wise or unwise we need not here discuss      book vii 18741880     chapter i retirement from leadership 18741875       “ἐγὼ μὲν ὧναξ πρεσβύτερός τε ἤδη εἰμὶ καὶ βαρὺς ἀείρεσθαι σὺ δέ     τινα τῶνδε τῶν νεωτέρων κέλευε ταῦτα ποιέειν”—herodotus iv 150      “i am too old o king and slow to stir so bid thou one of the     younger men here do these things”   a member of the great government of 1868 in a letter to one of his family gave an account of the final meeting of the cabinet—       feb 17 1874—i doubt—he says—whether i ever passed a more     eventful evening than yesterday the whole cabinet was assembled     we resolved after full discussion of pros and cons and some     slight difference of opinion to resign at once after which came     the startling announcement that gladstone would no longer retain     the leadership of the liberal party nor resume it unless the     party had settled its differences he will not expose himself to     the insults and outrages of 18668 and he has a keen sense of the     disloyalty of the party during the last three years he will sit     as a private member and occasionally speak for himself but he     will not attend the house regularly nor assume any one of the     functions of leader he does this not from anger but because he     says that it is absolutely necessary to party action to learn that     all the duties and responsibilities do not rest on the leaders     but that followers have their obligations too as a consequence of     this cardwell retires to the house of lords he will not take the     leadership nor will he consent to serve under any one but     gladstone he is too old he says lowe protests against the     anarchical experiment and talks of hartington as leader as     neither lowe nor bright nor goschen nor forster is in a     position to act as leader it may come to this so that the     liberal front benches of the two houses will be entirely     remodelled309   here is mr gladstone’s own account written twentythree years later and confirmed by all other accessible papers of the moment—       i was most anxious to make the retirement of the ministry the     occasion of my own i had served for more than forty years my     age—65—was greater than that of sir robert peel at his retirement     in 1846 or at his death in 1850 and was much beyond that at     which most of the leading commoners of the century had terminated     their political career together with their natural life i felt     myself to be in some measure out of touch with some of the     tendencies of the liberal party especially in religious matters     sir a clark whom i consulted would give me on medical grounds     no encouragement whatever but i deeply desired an interval     between parliament and the grave in spite of the solicitations of     my friends i persisted for 1874 there was a sort of compromise     “without prejudice” as having a title to some rest i was not a     very regular attendant but did not formally abdicate   m158 he found specific reasons for withdrawal in the state of the party feb 12—       1 the absence of any great positive aim the late plan budget     having failed for which to cooperate 2 the difficulty of     establishing united and vigorous action in the liberal party for     the purposes of economy 3 the unlikelihood of arriving at any     present agreement respecting education   in another fragment of the same date he says—       i do not forget that i am in debt to the party generally for     kindness indulgence and confidence much beyond what i have     deserved deeming myself unable to hold it together from my     present position in a manner worthy of it i see how unlikely it     is that i should hereafter be able to give any material aid in the     adjustment of its difficulties yet if such aid should at any time     be generally desired with a view to arresting some great evil or     procuring for the nation some great good my willingness to enter     into counsel for the occasion would follow from all i have said     but always with the understanding that as between section and     section i could not become a partisan and that such interference     even in the case of its proving useful would entail no obligation     whatever on those accepting it and carry with it no disturbance     of any arrangement subsisting at the time   the situation proved as lowe had foreseen an anarchic experiment mr gladstone went up to london for the session and followed his ordinary social course—       march 9 1874—off at 445 to windsor for the fête we dined at     st george’s hall i was presented to the duchess of c by the     queen and had a few kind words from hm 11—archbishop manning     911 it is kind in him to come but most of it is rather hollow     work limited as we are 16—dined at marlborough house a civil     talk with disraeli 20—finished vivian grey the first quarter     extremely clever the rest trash      may 15—emperor of russia’s reception at 315 he thanked me for     my conduct to russia while i was minister i assured his majesty i     had watched with profound interest the transactions of his reign     and the great benefits he had conferred upon his people he hoped     the relations of the two countries would always be good dined     at marlborough house stafford house ball afterwards the emperor     complained of the burden and late hours of evening entertainments     princess of wales so nice about her picture disraeli complained     of my absence said they could not get on without me 20—dined at     the fo to meet the emperor it was very kind of derby much work     at hawarden in arranging books and papers   the house of commons is hardly attractive to an irregular and perfunctory attendant and mr gladstone’s thoughts all turned to other fields to mrs gladstone he wrote early in april—       the antiparliamentary reaction has been stronger with me even     than i anticipated i am as far as possible from feeling the want     of the house of commons i could cheerfully go there to do a work     but i hope and pray to be as little there as possible except for     such an aim in london i think we were too much hustled to speak     leisurely or effectually of the future it will open for us by     degrees i shall be glad when the matter of money after all a     secondary one is disentangled but chiefly because it seems to     put pressure upon you i spoke to stephen about these matters on     saturday he was kind reasonable and in all ways as satisfactory     as possible there is one thing i should like you to understand     clearly as to my view of things for it is an essential part of     that view i am convinced that the welfare of mankind does not now     depend on the state or the world of politics the real battle is     being fought in the world of thought where a deadly attack is     made with great tenacity of purpose and over a wide field upon     the greatest treasure of mankind the belief in god and the gospel     of christ   in june sir stephen glynne died—“a dark dark day” “my brotherinlaw” wrote mr gladstone at a later date “was a man of singular refinement and as remarkable modesty his culture was high and his character one of deep interest his memory was on the whole decidedly the most remarkable known to me of the generation and country his life however was retired and unobtrusive but he sat in parliament i think for about fifteen years and was lordlieutenant of his county”       i thank you much—mr gladstone said to the duke of argyll—for your     kind note your sympathy and that of the duchess are ever ready     but even you can hardly tell how it is on this occasion needed and     warranted my wife has lost the last member of a family united by     bonds of the rarest tenderness the last representative of his     line the best of brothers who had ever drawn closer to her as     the little rank was thinned as for me no one can know what our     personal relations were without knowing the interior details of a     long family history and efforts and struggles in common carried     on through a long series of years which riveted into the closest     union our original affection he was a very rare man but we     grieve not for him he sleeps the sleep of the just the event is     a great one also to the outward frame of our life here310   m159 in the same letter he says it is most painful to him to be dragged into ecclesiastical turmoil as for example by the scotch patronage bill which he considers precipitate unwise and daring or the bill directed against the endowed schools commissioners of whom his brotherinlaw lord lyttelton was one in the last case he acted as a leader of an organised party but in the more important instance of a bill devised as mr disraeli said to put down ritualism his dissent from most of those around him fulfilled all the anticipations that had pointed to retirement the house was heartily in favour of the bill and what is called the country earnestly supported it though in the cabinet itself at least four ministers were strenuously hostile mr gladstone writes to his wife a trenchant account of his vigorous dealing with a prominent colleague who had rashly ventured to mark him for assault he sent word to the two archbishops that if they carried a certain amendment he should hold himself “altogether discharged from maintaining any longer the establishment of the church” he wrote to lord harrowby when the recess came—       i think or rather i am convinced that the effect either of one     or two more ecclesiastical sessions of parliament such as the     last or of any prolonged series of contentious proceedings under     the recent act upon subjects of widespread interest will be to     disestablish the church i do not feel the dread of     disestablishment which you may probably entertain but i desire     and seek so long as standing ground remains to avert not to     precipitate it   to another correspondent—       individually i have serious doubts whether the whole of the penal     proceedings taken in this country with respect to church matters     from the day of dr hampden downwards have not done considerably     more harm than good there is no doubt at all that all the evils     of whatever kind at which they were aimed exist at this moment     among us in a far more aggravated shape than when they began     my object and desire has ever been and still is to keep the     church of england together both as a church and as an     establishment as a church i believe she is strong enough by     virtue of the prayerbook to hold together under all     circumstances but as an establishment in my opinion she is not     strong enough to bear either serious secession or prolonged     parliamentary agitation   finally in a letter dated from whittinghame nov 17—       there are already too many causes of demoralisation operating upon     the house of commons if it is also to become a debased copy of an     ecclesiastical council all the worst men and worst qualities of     the worst men will come to the front and the place will become     intolerable   even any member of parliament who shares none of mr gladstone’s theology may sympathise to the full with his deep disgust at theologic and ecclesiastical discussions as conducted in that secular air we can easily understand how detestable he found it and how those discussions fortified his sense of estrangement from the ruling sentiments of the parliamentary party of which he was still the titular leader  of course the whigs always for keeping a parliamentary church in its proper place disliked his line liberals like thirlwall read his speeches “with great pain and suspicion” and declared their confidence to be shaken hardly any section was completely satisfied his mind in the autumn and winter of 1874 was absorbed as we shall see within a few pages in an assault upon the decrees of the vatican council of 1870 this assault as he told lord granville dec 7 1874 while tending “to hearten” the party generally was against his resumption of formal leadership because it widened the breach with the irishmen in the house of commons apart from this there were many questions each with a group of adherents to a special view but incapable of being pursued by common and united action he ran through the list in writing to lord granville it has historic interest—       1 extension of the suffrage with redistribution of seats abreast     or in the rear 2 disestablishment in scotland england 3 land     laws 4 retrenchment 5 colonial policy territorial extension     of the empire 6 reform of local government taxation 7 secular     education 8 undenominational education 9 irish affairs on no     one of these is there known to exist a plan desired by the entire     party or by any clear and decisive majority of it   on the whole he was persuaded that neither the party generally nor the country desired another period of active reforms even if he were fit to conduct them besides this he confessed his “apprehension that differences would spring up and great shrinking from any breach with the party and a determination often expressed never if he could help it to lead one branch of it against another” in many forms he carried lord granville with him round the circle of his arguments he once sent his points on halfadozen scraps of paper granville playfully replied “i should like to treat them as old lord bessborough used to treat his playingcards when luck was adverse—tear them up into small bits and toss them in the fire” nothing shook him not even mrs gladstone’s misgivings to her he wrote from carlton house terrace on the eve of the session of 1875—       now for the grave matter about the leadership i have had much     conversation with granville and cardwell and i am going to see     hartington also goschen tomorrow my letter is rewritten and     improved but i am obliged to stand to my conclusion for many     reasons among them the church reason is one of the most serious     and the other the undefined and prolonged character of the service     if now undertaken this while arguing and deprecating they admit     i think to a great extent our old colleagues are inclined to come     up on thursday if they can and this will be rather to hear than     to debate hartington will succeed i am indeed sorry that you and     i have not been able to take the same view of this important     subject but you know that i am acting on convictions very long     entertained and will i am sure believe that i have probed myself     deeply and used all the means in my power to get at a right     conclusion nay i think you will be more reconciled when i tell     you that granville did not really see his way either to a nominal     leadership or to making any arrangement by which i could after a     short time with some certainty have escaped i saw clark last     night and this morning he gives an excellent account of me and     makes it impossible for me to plead health as my reason   the drama went rapidly forward—       jan 12—i find that the agreement made yesterday that i should     meet my former colleagues on monday will require me to remain     until this day though after a pretty busy morning the pressure is     less i have however to preside in the evening at the meeting of     the metaphysical society and to listen though i hope nothing     more to a tough discussion manning i am sorry to say will be     there his pamphlet is at length going to press and will extend     he says to 150 pages newman is not out yet      11 carlton house terrace jan 14 ’75—this great affair is     nearly arranged my old colleagues all submit under protest and i     shall be free an article in the times this morning is     undisguisedly aimed at getting rid of me but it does not express     any of their feelings we have had a morning at granville’s     halifax granville cardwell hartington aberdare forster     carlingford stansfeld selborne goschen lowe kimberley—in     short all i think except argyll and bright there was argument     and exhortation and much kindness my letter to granville will be     accompanied by a short reply from him expressing difference of     opinion and regret they are afraid of being blamed by the party     if they seem to show indifference   the queen thanked mr gladstone for communicating to her his resolution of retiring from the more active duties of parliamentary life she was not entirely unprepared for it after what he told her himself last year “she knows that his zeal and untiring energy have always been exerted with the desire of advancing the welfare of the nation and maintaining the honour of the crown and she thanks him for his loyal assurances of support on all occasions when it may become necessary”  m160 the duke of argyll wrote “sincerely to congratulate” him upon his withdrawal bright on the other hand jan 17 said he could not applaud yet he would not blame mr gladstone’s course seemed so unfortunate if not disastrous to the great public interests committed to him—       for myself says bright if i could have foreseen either the     result of the election of last year or your retirement from the     conduct of the party i should certainly have withdrawn from     parliament where now i seem to have quite as little of duty or of     a mission as you have the front opposition bench is full of     discord and when you are not there full of jealousy and i find     myself without any particular attraction to any particular part of     the house however i will not complain some door of escape may     open for me and i can become a spectator as you are proposing to     be      i hope on some occasion i may have the chance of seeing you when     you come to town i have had so much pleasure in your friendship     and have gained so much from it that i would fain hope it need     not cease now when our association will necessarily be less     frequent than it has been of late years whether you come back to     the political field or turn wholly to study and to literature i     am sure you will be usefully employed and i hope that nothing but     blessing may rest upon all your labours   the feeling among liberals in the country was of deep dismay some of the whigs doubtless found solace in the anticipation that a new middle party might be formed with “a recovery of the old liberal position demolished for the time by john mill gladstone and cobden”311 but this was limited to a narrow circle “all sunshine is gone out of politics” was a general phrase the news was compared by one correspondent to gelon’s message to the greeks that the spring was taken out of their year312  an organ of the stiff nonconformists said313 “against his government we felt that we had a great grievance for himself the nonconformists of this country have long cherished a loyalty more fervent we are inclined to imagine than that with which he has been regarded by any other section of the community he beyond all other modern statesmen with perhaps here and there a doubtful exception gave us the impression of a man who regarded politics as a part of christian duty” and the same writers most truly added “we do not know what the english people have done for mr gladstone that can be compared for a moment with what mr gladstone has done for them claims on him we have none he has far more than discharged any debt that he could have owed to the nation” these words are a just remonstrance against the somewhat tyrannical conventions of english public life  when the session began he wrote to mrs gladstone feb 15 “i came down to the house and took my seat nearly in the same spot as last year finding bright my neighbour with which i was very well pleased granville and hartington both much preferred my continuing on the front bench to my going elsewhere” lord hartington strongly encouraged against his own inclinations by mr gladstone accepted a thankless and unpromising post and held it with honour and credit for five difficult years to come     chapter ii vaticanism 18741875       let no susceptibilities puritan protestant anglican or other     be startled if we observe that rome is and may long be in some     important respects the centre of the christian world it is     indeed a centre which repels as well as attracts which probably     repels even more than it attracts but which whether repelling or     attracting influences—gladstone 1875    i   one question as the reader by this time well knows living deepest in mr gladstone’s heart and mind from his first book in 1838 onwards was the relation of the churches to modern society english statesmen are wont to be either blind to the existence of such a question or else they seek an easy refuge from it in a perfunctory erastianism sometimes intellectually refined sometimes a little brutish but always shallow in all the three great branches of christianity the latin the greek or orthodox the protestant mr gladstone’s interest was incessant sincere and profound it covered their theology their organisation their history and principles of growth the bearings of their system upon individual character and social wellbeing all over europe he was one of the very few public men capable of discerning that the fall of the temporal power of the pope marked a more startling change and a profounder crisis in human history than the unification of italy the unification of germany the reconstructed republic in france perhaps even than the preservation of the american union he knew the force of ideas in the world he realised the vast transformations that had in their succession swept over the minds of men since cardinal dogmas had been established he comprehended the motion in articles of faith as men made their “voyagings through strange seas of thought” he was alive to the fact that moral crises brought on by change in intellectual outlook and temperature are of deeper concern than questions of territory or dynasty or form of government the moral crisis is what reaches furthest and matters most a movement of the first magnitude was accentuated by pius ix when by the syllabus of 1864 he challenged modern society in all its foundations its aims its principles in the whole range of its ideals some called this daring ultimatum the gravest event since the french uprising in 1789 the syllabus prepared the way for a more elaborately organised operation on behalf of papal authority the train was secretly laid for a grand reaction a grand reinstallation of the christian faith314  m161 the pope had been despoiled of territory his sway within the walls of rome itself was in constant danger his most powerful protector north of the alps had been weakened and humiliated by protestant prussia he was now to be compensated for his calamities by a majestic demonstration of his hold upon the spiritual allegiance of millions of adherents in every portion of the habitable globe the twentieth ecumenical council assembled in st peter’s at rome on december 8 1869 in this gathering of catholic prelates from both hemispheres two antagonistic schools confronted one another the ultramontanes held that the revolutionary welter and confusion of the modern world could only be healed by solemn affirmation of the principle of sovereign authority lodged in an infallible pope with absolute power to define by that apostolic authority what ought to be held as articles of faith or morals the assumptions the standards the ruling types of the modern age they boldly encountered with rigid iteration of maxims of old time imposing obedience and submission to a fixed social order and a divinely commissioned hierarchy inflexibility was to be the single watchword by which the church could recover a world that from naples even to mexico seemed to be rapidly drifting away from her the opposing school took other ground perhaps they saw that supremacy is one thing and infallibility another thing quite different the liberal catholics did not contest the dogma of papal infallibility they questioned the expediency of its proclamation they were for associating ideas of religion with ideas of liberty they were not for extending the domain of miracle and the supernatural  then as in the old historic councils influence of race and nation had decisive effects it could not be otherwise in what was in essence a conflict between a centralised doctrinal authority on the one hand and the inextinguishable tendency towards national churches on the other the italian bishops went with the pope the germans as of old they had been for emperor against priest were now on the side of freedom against what certain of them did not hesitate to call tyranny and fraud some of the ablest of the french were true to gallican tradition and resisted the decree among the most active and uncompromising of all the ultramontane party was our english manning315    ii   at the end of november 1869 acton had written to mr gladstone from rome “your letter is a very sad one” mr gladstone answered “i feel as deep and real an interest in the affairs of other christian communions as in my own and most of all in the case of the most famous of them all and the one within which the largest number of christian souls find their spiritual food” before manning left for rome an amiable correspondence took place between mr gladstone and him “how sad it is for us both”—this was mr gladstone’s startingpoint—“considering our personal relations that we should now be in this predicament that the things which the one looks to as the salvation of faith and church the other regards as their destruction”  to mr odo russell now the informal agent of the british government in rome the prime minister wrote—       it is curious that manning has so greatly changed his character     when he was archdeacon with us all his strength was thought to     lie in a governing faculty and in its wise moderation now he is     ever quoted as the ultra of ultras and he seems greatly to have     overshot his mark the odds seem to be that the child yet unborn     will rue the calling of this council for if the best result     arrive in the triumph of the fallibilitarians will not even this     be a considerable shock to the credit and working efficacy of the     papal system you must really be all eyes and ears a very argus     in both organs until the occasion has gone by   as for the issue of the council acton having mr odo russell in agreement with him from the first conveyed to mr gladstone his opinion that the pope would prevail       the only hope in my mind said mr gladstone in reply is that     there may be a real minority and that it may speak plainly a few     bold men would easily insure themselves a noble immortality but     will any have the courage the italian government have one and     only one method in their hands of fighting the pope and that is     to run against nomination from rome the old and more popular     methods of choosing bishops by clerical election with the     approbation of the flock316 unless they resort to this they     can do nothing      all the accounts from rome he tells lacaita jan 2 1870 are     as bad as possible for the first time in my life i shall now be     obliged to talk about popery for it would be a scandal to call     the religion they are manufacturing at rome by the same name as     that of pascal or of bossuet or of ganganelli the truth is that     ultramontanism is an antisocial power and never has it more     undisguisedly assumed that character than in the syllabus   m162 the french government wrote despatches of mild protest but said nothing of withdrawing their garrison mr gladstone and lord clarendon were for informing the roman court that they were cognizant of the french despatches and approved of their tenour the queen and the cabinet however were entirely averse to meddling with the council and nothing was done officially this did not prevent mr gladstone from telling archbishop manning what impediments would be placed in the way of irish legislation by the state of english feeling as to the syllabus and other papal proceedings “my feelings and convictions” he says april 16 “are as you well know decidedly with your ‘opposition’ which i believe to be contending for the religious and civil interests of mankind against influences highly disastrous and menacing to both but the prevailing opinion is that it is better to let those influences take their course and work out the damage which they will naturally and surely entail upon the see of rome and upon what is bound to it” in parliament there was an utter aversion to the roman policy and he gives instances noting even a change of opinion about the irish land bill “what i have described is no matter of speculation i know it by actual and daily touch i am glad you have moved me to state it in some detail it is to me matter of profound grief especially as regards land in ireland”  to lord acton—       of all the prelates at rome none have a finer opportunity to     none is a more crucial test now applied than to those of the     united states for if there where there is nothing of covenant     of restraint or of equivalent between the church and the state     the propositions of the syllabus are still to have the countenance     of the episcopate it becomes really a little difficult to     maintain in argument the civil rights of such persons to     toleration however conclusive be the argument of policy in favour     of granting it i can hardly bring myself to speculate or care on     what particular day the foregone conclusion is to be finally     adopted my grief is sincere and deep but it is at the whole     thing so ruinous in its consequences as they concern faith in my     view the size of the minority though important is not nearly so     important as the question whether there will be a minority at all   there was a minority in a division taken at a late stage 451 composed the majority 88 resisted and 62 were for a new examination then the minority turned their backs on rome and on july 18 the definition of infallibility was acclaimed in st peter’s in presence of the pope by 533 against 2  mr gladstone is very glad when clarendon instructs mr russell to turn his back on the festivities at rome “the whole proceeding has been monstrous and it will hereafter become one of the laughingstocks of history the fanaticism of the middle ages is really sober compared with that of the nineteenth century” “the proclamation of infallibility” he said to bishop moriarty “i must own i look upon as the most portentous taking them singly of all events in the history of the christian church”    iii   the next day as we know war was declared by france against germany the french garrison left rome and on september 20 the italians marched in  a month before the war broke out mr gladstone wrote to lord clarendon “i would avoid any official support of the italian application to france for the evacuation of rome by saying that this country had always abstained from mixing in that question and that we were the more induced to persevere in that policy from being well convinced that the french government is perfectly aware that in this country the occupation of any part of the pontifical territories by french troops is regarded with regret pain and disapproval further that those who most strongly entertain these sentiments are generally the persons who most highly value and have most striven to promote the good understanding between france and england”  the occupation of rome by the italian government brought upon mr gladstone various demands and movements from different parts of the country his cabinet agreed that the proper course was to decline all interference with a view to the restoration of the temporal power though they accepted the task of promoting by means of friendly representations arrangements to secure the pontiff’s freedom and becoming support then some of his presbyterian friends asked him why he should even do so much as this when he would take no such steps for the moderator of the free church now consider mr gladstone replied “the pope is a sovereign who was in lawful possession of large revenues and who had charged himself with the support of a body of cardinals ministers nuncios servants and guards out of those revenues he has been dispossessed not for any fault of his own but because clerical dominion was deemed intolerable in the maintenance of the pope and his court followers and agents six millions of our fellowsubjects or thereabouts are deeply interested and they are making demands upon us which we are forced to decline but i should for one be ashamed to deny that there are the strongest equitable claims upon the italian government growing out of the past state of things that in these equitable claims the six millions i speak of have a real interest and share and as the matter is international and they have no locus standi with the italian government it is our part so far to plead their cause if need be”    iv   m163 four years elapsed before mr gladstone was in a position to follow up his strong opinions on the injury done as he believed to human liberty by the vatican decrees but the great debate between ultramontanes and old catholics was followed by him with an interest that never slackened in september 1874 he went to munich and we can hardly be wrong in ascribing to that visit the famous tract which was to make so lively a stir before the end of the year his principal object was to communicate with dr döllinger and this object he tells mrs gladstone was fully gained “i think” he says “i have spent twothirds of my whole time with dr döllinger who is indeed a most remarkable man and it makes my blood run cold to think of his being excommunicated in his venerable but thank god hale and strong old age in conversation we have covered a wide field i know no one with whose mode of viewing and handling religious matters i more cordially agree he is wonderful and simple as a child”  “i think it was in 1874” döllinger afterwards mentioned “that i remember gladstone’s paying me a visit at six o’clock in the evening we began talking on political and theological subjects and became both of us so engrossed with the conversation that it was two o’clock at night when i left the room to fetch a book from my library bearing on the matter in hand i returned with it in a few minutes and found him deep in a volume he had drawn out of his pocket—true to his principle of never losing time—during my momentary absence”317 “in the course of a walk out of munich in the travelling season of 1874” mr gladstone wrote sixteen years later “dr döllinger told me that he was engaged in the work of retrial through the whole circle of his latin teaching and knowledge the results were tested in his proceedings at bonn when he attempted to establish a formula concordiae upon the questions which most gravely divided christendom”318 among other topics mr gladstone commended to his mentor the idea of a republication in a series of the best works of those whom he would call the henotic or eirenic writers on the differences that separate christians and churches from one another he also read pichler on the theology of leibnitz not without suspicion that it was rather pichler than leibnitz but neither leibnitz nor pichler was really in his mind  after the session of 1874 when the public ear and mind had been possessed by the word ritualism he had as usual sought a vent in a magazine article for the thoughts with which he was teeming319 he speaks with some disdain of the question whether a handful of the clergy are or are not engaged in “an utterly hopeless and visionary effort to romanise the church and people of england” at no time he says since the sanguinary reign of mary has such a scheme been possible least of all he proceeds could the scheme have life in it “when rome has substituted for the proud boast of semper eadem a policy of violence and change in faith when she has refurbished and paraded anew every rusty tool she was fondly thought to have disused when no one can become her convert without renouncing his moral and mental freedom and placing his civil loyalty and duty at the mercy of another and when she has equally repudiated modern thought and ancient history” if these strong words expressed his state of mind before he went abroad we may readily imagine how the bavarian air would fan the flame  though dr döllinger himself—“so inaccessible to religious passions”—was not aware of the purpose of his english friend there can be little doubt that mr gladstone returned from munich with the same degree of internal ferment as that which had possessed his mind on his return from naples threeandtwenty years before in october he writes to lord acton from hawarden—       what you have said on the subject of ultramontanism and of the     mode in which it should be handled appears to me to be as wise     and as good as is possible it is really a case for hitting hard     but for hitting the right men in anything i say or do on the     subject i would wish heartily and simply to conform to the spirit     of your words but i feel myself drawn onwards indeed some of     your words help to draw me the question with me now is whether i     shall or shall not publish a tract which i have written and of     which the title would probably be “the vatican decrees in their     bearing on civil allegiance a political expostulation” i incline     to think that i ought to publish it if it were in your power and     will to run over here for a night or two i should seek to profit     by your counsel and should ask you to read as much of the ms as     your patience would endure a more substantial attraction would be     that i could go over much of my long and interesting conversations     with döllinger    v   m164 the pamphlet320 appeared in november and was meant for an argument that the decree of infallibility aimed a deadly blow at the old historic scientific and moderate school it was a degradation of the episcopal order it carried to its furthest point that spirit of absolutist centralisation which in its excesses is as fatal to vigorous life in the church as in the state it overthrew the principle not even denied by the council of trent in the sixteenth century that the pope and his judgments were triable by the assembled representatives of the christian world  thrice in history it seemed as if the constitutional party in the church was about to triumph at the council of constance in the fifteenth century in the conflict between the french episcopate and innocent xi in the days of bossuet and thirdly when clement xiv exactly a hundred years before now dealt with the jesuits and “levelled in the dust the deadliest foes that mental and moral liberty have ever known” from july 1870 all this had passed away and the constitutional party had seen its deathwarrant signed and sealed the “myrmidons of the apostolic chamber” had committed their church to revolutionary measures the vast new claims were lodged in the reign of a pontiff who by the dark syllabus of 1864 had condemned free speech a free press liberty of conscience toleration of nonconformity the free study of civil and philosophic things independently of church authority marriage unless sacramentally contracted and all definition by the state of the civil rights of the church  m165 “it has been a favourite purpose of my life” mr gladstone said “not to conjure up but to conjure down public alarms i am not now going to pretend that either foreign foe or domestic treason can at the bidding of the court of rome disturb these peaceful shores but although such fears may be visionary it is more visionary still to suppose for one moment that the claims of gregory vii of innocent iii and of boniface viii have been disinterred in the nineteenth century like hideous mummies picked out of egyptian sarcophagi in the interests of archæology or without a definite and practical aim” what then was the clear and foregone purpose behind the parade of all these astonishing reassertions the first was—by claims to infallibility in creed to the prerogative of miracles to dominion over the unseen world—to satisfy spiritual appetites sharpened into reaction and made morbid by “the levity of the destructive speculations so widely current and the notable hardihood of the antichristian writing of the day” this alone however would not explain the deliberate provocation of all the “risks of so daring a raid upon the civil sphere” the answer was to be found in the favourite design hardly a secret design of restoring by the road of force when any favourable opportunity should arise and of reerecting the terrestrial throne of the popedom “even if it could only be reerected on the ashes of the city and amidst the whitening bones of the people”  and this brings the writer to the immediate practical aspects of his tract “if the baleful power which is expressed by the phrase curia romana and not at all adequately rendered in its historic force by the usual english equivalent ‘court of rome’ really entertains the scheme it doubtless counts on the support in every country of an organised and devoted party which when it can command the scales of political power will promote interference and while it is in a minority will work for securing neutrality as the peace of europe may be in jeopardy and as the duties even of england as one of its constabulary authorities might come to be in question it would be most interesting to know the mental attitude of our roman catholic fellowcountrymen in england and ireland with reference to the subject and it seems to be one on which we are entitled to solicit information” too commonly the spirit of the convert was to be expressed by the notorious words “a catholic first an englishman afterwards”—words that properly convey no more than a truism “for every christian must seek to place his religion even before his country in his inner heart but very far from a truism in the sense in which we have been led to construe them” this indeed was a new and very real “papal aggression” for himself mr gladstone said it should not shake his allegiance to “the rule of maintaining equal civil rights irrespectively of religious differences” had he not given conclusive indications of that view by supporting in parliament as a minister since the council the repeal in 1871 of the law against ecclesiastical titles whose enactment he had opposed twenty years before  that the pamphlet should create intense excitement was inevitable from the place of the writer in the public eye from the extraordinary vehemence of the attack and above all from the unquenchable fascination of the topic whether the excitement in the country was more than superficial whether most readers fathomed the deep issues as they stood not between catholic and protestant but between catholic and catholic within the fold whether in fastening upon the civil allegiance of english romanists mr gladstone took the true point against vaticanism—these are questions that we need not here discuss the central proposition made a cruel dilemma for a large class of the subjects of the queen for the choice assigned to them by assuming stringent logic was between being bad citizens if they submitted to the decree of papal infallibility and bad catholics if they did not protestant logicians wrote to mr gladstone that if his contention were good we ought now to repeal catholic emancipation and again clap on the fetters syllogisms in action are but stupid things after all unless they are checked by a tincture of what seems paradox321 apart from the particular issue in his vatican pamphlet mr gladstone believed himself to be but following his own main track in life and thought in his assault upon “a policy which declines to acknowledge the high place assigned to liberty in the counsels of providence and which upon the pretext of the abuse that like every other good she suffers expels her from its system”  among the names that he was never willing to discuss with me—machiavelli for instance—was joseph de maistre the hardiest most adventurous most ingenious and incisive of all the speculative champions of european reaction322 in the pages of de maistre he might have found the reasoned base on which the ultramontane creed may be supposed to rest he would have found liberty depicted less as a blessing than a scourge even bossuet denounced as a heretic with dubious chances of salvation for his struggle on behalf of a national church against roman centralisation the old greeks held up to odium as a race of talkers frivolous light and born incorrigible dividers in dealing with de maistre mr gladstone would have had a foeman worthier of his powerful steel than the authors of the syllabus schema postulatum and all the rest of what he called the vaticanism of 1870 but here as always he was man of action and wrote for a specific though perhaps a fugitive purpose    vi   m166 at the end of the year the total number printed of the tract was 145000 and of these 120000 were in a people’s edition “my pamphlet” he tells lacaita “has brought upon me such a mass of work as i can hardly cope with and i am compelled to do all things as succinctly as possible though my work is with little intermission from morning till night i agree with you that the pamphlet in the main tells its own story and i am glad there is no need to select in a hurry some one to write on the difference between papism and catholicism there is no doubt that the discussion opens ie makes a breach in the walls of the papal theology and it ought to be turned to account but i shall have enough to do with all my hands if i am to work properly through the task i have undertaken not i trust for long for i think another pamphlet should suffice to end it on my side but i am vexed that manning as if he had been pulled up at rome after having announced his formal reply six weeks ago hangs fire and now talks of delaying it” the result he assures lord granville nov 25 “must be injurious to the pestilent opinions that have so grievously obtained the upper hand in that church and to the party which means to have a war in europe for the restoration of the temporal power to place impediments in their way has been my principal purpose”  he told acton dec 18 “when you were putting in caveats and warnings you did not say to me ‘now mind this affair will absorb some perhaps many months of your life’ it has been so up to the present moment and it evidently will be so for some time” with acton he carried on elaborate correspondence upon some of the questions raised by the syllabus notably on the effect of the pope’s disciplinary judgment on anglican marriages converting them into relations that were not marriage at all he fears that he has conceded too much to the papal party in not treating the syllabus as ex cathedra in allowing that the popes had been apt to claim dogmatic infallibility for wellnigh a thousand years as to the ecumenicity of the vatican council among other matters he was reading “the curious volumes of discorsi di pio ix published at rome and he might find it his duty to write collaterally upon them” this duty he performed with much fidelity in the quarterly review for january 1875 he is active in interest about translations keen to enlist auxiliaries in every camp and all countries delighted with all utterances from italy or elsewhere that make in his direction even noting with satisfaction that the agnostic huxley was warm in approval “i pass my days and nights” he tells the duke of argyll dec 19 “in the vatican already the pope has given me two months of incessant correspondence and other hard work and it may very well last two more nor is this work pleasant but i am as far as possible from repenting of it as no one else to whom the public would listen saved me the trouble it is full of intense interest every post brings a mass of general reading writing or both forty covers of one kind or another today and all my time is absorbed but the subject is well worth the pains” the italians lord granville told him “generally approved but were puzzled why you should have thought it necessary” retorts and replies arose in swarms including one from manning and another from newman he was accused by some of introducing a bismarckian kulturkampf into england of seeking to recover his lost popularity by pandering to nopopery of disregarding the best interests of the country for the sake of his own restoration to power323       i have now finished reading—he said at the beginning of     february—the 20th reply to my pamphlet they cover 1000 pages and     i am hard at work preparing mine with a good conscience and i     think a good argument manning has been i think as civil as he     could feb 5—all this morning i have had to spend in hunting     up one important statement of manning’s which i am almost     convinced is a gross misstatement feb 6—manning in his     200 pages has not i venture to say made a single point against     me but i shall have to show up his quotations very seriously we     have exchanged one or two friendly notes 8—worked on vaticanism     nearly all day and an exception to my rule late at night     14—eight hours’ work on my proof sheets 15—went through acton’s     corrections and notes on my proofs 19—worked much in evening on     finishing up my tract dr döllinger’s final criticisms having     arrived he thinks highly of the work which he observes will cut     deeper than the former one and be more difficult to deal with by     midnight i had the revises ready with the corrections     20—inserted one or two references and wrote “press” on the 2nd     revises may the power and blessing of god go with the work   the second tract was more pungent than the first and it gave pleasure to an important minister abroad who had now entangled himself by falk laws and otherwise in a quarrel with the papacy “i have had a letter of thanks” mr gladstone writes to hawarden march 6 “from bismarck this pamphlet is stouter sharper and cheaper than the last but is only in its eleventh thousand i believe” among others who replied to vaticanism was dr newman he appended a new postscript of fourandtwenty pages to his former answer to the first of mr gladstone’s pamphlets its tone is courteous and argumentative—far too much so to please the ultras who had the pope’s ear—and without the wild hitting that mr gladstone found in manning  newman wrote to thank him jan 17 1875 for a letter that he described as “forbearing and generous” “it has been a great grief to me” said newman “to have had to write against one whose career i have followed from first to last with so much i may say loyal interest and admiration i had known about you from others and had looked at you with kindly curiosity before you came up to christ church and from the time that you were launched into public life you have retained a hold on my thoughts and on my gratitude by the various marks of attention which every now and then you have shown me when you had an opportunity and i could not fancy my ever standing towards you in any other relation than that which had lasted so long what a fate it is that now when so memorable a career has reached its formal termination retirement from leadership i should be the man on the very day on which it closed to present to you amid the many expressions of public sympathy which it elicits a controversial pamphlet as my offering” but he could not help writing it he was called upon from such various quarters and his conscience told him that he who had been in great measure the cause of so many becoming catholics had no right to leave them in the lurch when charges were made against them as serious as unexpected “i do not think” he concluded “i ever can be sorry for what i have done but i never can cease to be sorry for the necessity of doing it”    vii   m167 this fierce controversial episode was enough to show that the habit and temperament of action still followed him in the midst of all his purposes of retreat withdrawal from parliamentary leadership was accompanied by other steps apparently all making in the same direction he sold the house in carlton house terrace where he had passed eightandtwenty years of work and power and varied sociability “i had grown to the house” he says april 15 “having lived more time in it than in any other since i was born and mainly by reason of all that was done in it” to mrs gladstone he wrote feb 28—       i do not wonder that you feel parting from the house will be a     blow and a pang it is nothing less than this to me but it must     be faced and you will face it gallantly so much has occurred     there and thus it is leaving not the house only but the     neighbourhood where i have been with you for more than     thirtyfive years and altogether nearly forty the truth is that     innocently and from special causes we have on the whole been     housed better than according to our circumstances all along     carlton house terrace i think you would not find any one with less     than £20000 a year and most of them with much more   he sold his collection of china and his wedgwood ware324 he despatched his books to hawarden he can hardly have resolved on retirement that should be effective and complete or else he must have arranged to quit the house of commons in his diary he entered march 30 1875—       views about the future and remaining section of my life in     outline they are undefined but in substance definite the main     point is this that setting aside exceptional circumstances which     would have to provide for themselves my prospective work is not     parliamentary my ties will be slight to an assembly with whose     tendencies i am little in harmony at the present time nor can i     flatter myself that what is called the public out of doors is more     sympathetic but there is much to be done with the pen all     bearing much on high and sacred ends for even homeric study as i     view it is in this very sense of high importance and what lies     beyond this is concerned directly with the great subject of     belief   to mrs gladstone he wrote may 19 1875 “i am feeling as it were my way towards the purposes of the rest of my life it will i dare say clear by degrees for the general business of the country my ideas and temper are thoroughly out of harmony with the ideas and temper of the day especially as they are represented in london”  the movement of negation had been in full swing for a dozen years before the force and weight of it had amid the stress and absorption of daily business reached his inner mind in may 1872 in a speech as member of the council of king’s college—“averse from and little used to platform speaking” as he described himself to manning—he used some strong language about those who promulgate as science what is not science and as religion what is not religion but he took care to sever himself from the recent roman decrees which “seemed much to resemble the proclamation of a perpetual war against the progress and the movement of the human mind”325 in december 1872 he caused a marked sensation by an address at liverpool in which he spoke of strauss’s book on new and old belief326 he had become a member of the metaphysical society where eminent representatives of every faith and of no faith discussed every aspect of the foundations of human creeds he was of too masculine and energetic a cast of mind to feel mere shock as he listened to huxley tyndall clifford harrison firmly arguing materialism or positivism or agnosticism or other unhistoric forms that his whole soul was energetically oppugnant i need not say his reverence for freedom never wavered he wrote to an editor who had criticised his liverpool address jan 3 1873—       in the interest of my address i wish to say that not a word to my     knowledge fell from me limiting the range of free inquiry nor     have i ever supposed st paul to say anything so silly as “prove     all things but some you must not prove” doubtless some obscurity     of mine i know not what has led to an error into which the able     writer of the article has fallen not alone   to the duke of argyll he wrote—       dec 28 ’72—i have been touching upon deep and dangerous     subjects at liverpool whether i went beyond my province many may     doubt but of the extent of the mischief i do not doubt any more     than of its virulence all that i hear from day to day convinces     me of the extension of this strange epidemic for it is not     considering how it comes worthy of being called a rational or     scientific process be it however what it may we politicians are     children playing with toys in comparison to that great work of and     for manhood which has to be done and will yet be done in     restoring belief   sir robert morier sent him from munich frohschammer’s reply to strauss “if i understand him aright” said mr gladstone “he is a unitarian minus miracle and inspiration” the whole book seemed to him able honest and diligent—       but he adds i am one of those who think the christianity of     frohschammer as i have described it is like a tall tree     scientifically prepared for the saw by the preliminary process     well known to woodcutters of clearing away with the axe all     projecting roots which as long as they remained rendered the     final operation impossible this first process leaves the tree     standing in a very trim condition much more mathematical in form     as it is more near a cylinder than in its native state the     business of the saw when the horse and the man arrive is soon     accomplished   to his article on ritualism he prefixed as motto two short lines of pindar about days that are to come being wisest witnesses327 in spite of retreat it was impossible that he should forget the vast responsibility imposed upon him both by his gifts and by the popular ascendency into which they had brought him his was not the retreat of selfindulgence and the days that were to come speedily brought him duties that were to bear him far into regions of storm and conflict now unforeseen meanwhile with occasional visits to westminster he lived even and industrious days at hawarden felling trees working at greek mythology and ethnology delighting in the woods and glades of the park above all delighting in the tranquillity of his “temple of peace” besides being the bookroom of a student this was still a farshining beacon in the popular eye if sages scholars heroes saints with time’s serene and hallowed gravity looked upon him from their shelves yet loud echoes sounded in his ear from roaring surges of an outer world—from turbid ebb and flow of all the struggle and clamorous hopes and halfblind mysterious instincts of the nations     chapter iii the octagon       it is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion it is     easy in solitude to live after our own but the great man is he     who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the     independence of solitude—emerson   near the end of the eighties mr gladstone built for himself a fireproof room at the northwestern corner of his temple of peace in this octagon—“a necessity of my profession and history”—he stored the letters and papers of his crowded lifetime he estimated the “selected letters” addressed to himself at sixty thousand and the mass of other letters that found their way into the octagon without selection along with more than a score of large folios containing copies of his own to other people run to several tens of thousands more there are between five and six hundred holographs from the queen afterward designated by him in his will to be an heirloom “it may amuse you” he told lord granville who always wrote the shortest letters that ever were known “to learn that your letters to me weigh fifteen pounds and ahalf” probably no single human being ever received sixty thousand letters worth keeping and of these it is safe to say that threefourths of them might as well have been destroyed as soon as read including a certain portion that might just as well never have been either written or read this slightly improvident thrift recalls the jealous persons who will not suffer the british museum to burn its rubbish on the curious principle that what was never worth producing must always be worth preserving  m168 as for mr gladstone’s own share he explains his case in what he says 1865 to the widow of mr cobden “of the kind of correspondence properly called private and personal i have none indeed for many long long years it has been out of my power except in very few instances to keep up this kind of correspondence” the exceptions are few indeed half of the contents of this crowded little chamber are papers of business—nightly letters to the queen telling her what had gone on in the house and what sort of figure had been cut by its debaters reports of meetings of the cabinet memoranda for such meetings notes for speeches endless correspondence with colleagues and all the other operations incident to the laborious machinery of government in the charge of a master engineer in this region of his true calling all is order precision persistency and the firmness and ease of the strong for many years in that department all was action strength success church leaders again contribute considerable piles but these too mainly concern church business for the hour and the business has now even for adherents naturally fallen out of memory the more miscellaneous papers are different there a long and strange procession flits before our eye—dreams “little bustling passions” trivialities floating like a myriad motes into the dim octagon we are reminded how vast a space in our everdwindling days is consumed by social invitations and the discovery of polite reasons for evading them “bona verba” is a significant docket prompting the secretary’s reply it is borne in upon us how grievously the burden of man’s lot is aggravated by slovenly dates illegible signatures and forgetfulness that writing is something meant to be read there is a mountain of letters from one correspondent so mercilessly written that the labour of decyphering them would hardly be justified even if one could hope to recover traces of the second decade of livy or the missing books of the annals of tacitus foreign rulers indian potentates american citizens all write to the most conspicuous englishman of the time in an unformed hand a little princess thanks him for a photograph and says “i am so glad to have seen you at windsor and will try and remember you all my life” there are bushels of letters whose writers “say all that they conscientiously can” for applicants nominees and candidates in every line where a minister is supposed to be able to lend a helping hand if he likes actors send him boxes queens of song press on him lozenges infallible for the vocal cords fine ladies dabbling in italian seek counsel and not far off what is more to the point are letters from young men thanking him for his generosity in aiding them to go to oxford with a view to taking orders charles kean a popular tragedian of those times and son of one more famous still thanks mr gladstone for his speech at a complimentary dinner to him march 1862 and says how proud he is to remember that they were boys at eton together then there are the erudite but unfruitful correspondents with the melancholy docket “learning thrown away” and charming professors of poetry—as though the alto should insist on singing the basso part—impressively assure him how dreadfully uneasy they are about the weakness of our army and how horribly low upon the security of our indian empire  m169 some have said that to peruse the papers of a prime minister must lower one’s view of human nature perhaps this may partly depend upon the prime minister partly on the height of our expectations from our fellowcreatures if such a survey is in any degree depressing there can be no reason why it should be more so than any other large inspection of human life in the octagon as in any similar repository we come upon plenty of baffled hopes chagrin in finding a career really ended absurd overestimates of self overestimates of the good chances of the world vexation of those who have chosen the wrong path at the unfair good luck of those who have chosen the right we may smile but surely in goodnatured sympathy at the zeal of poor ladies for a post for husbands of unrecognised merit or at the importunity of younger sons with large families but inadequate means harmless things of this sort need not turn us into satirists or cynics  all the riddles of the great public world are there—why one man becomes prime minister while another who ran him close at school and college ends with a pension from the civil list why the same stable and same pedigree produce a derby winner and the poor cabhack why one falls back almost from the start while another runs famously until the corner and then his vaulting ambition dwindles to any place of “moderate work and decent emolument” how new competitors swim into the field of vision how suns rise and set with no return and vanish as if they had never been suns but only ghosts or bubbles how in these timeworn papers successive generations of active men run chequered courses group following group names blazing into the fame of a day then like the spangles of a rocket expiring men write accepting posts all excitement full of hope and assurance of good work and then we remember how quickly clouds came and the office ended in failure and torment in the next pigeonhole just in the same way is the radiant author’s gift of his book that after all fell stillborn one need not be prime minister to know the eternal tale of the vanity of human wishes or how men move       thundering like ramping hosts of warrior horse     to throw that faint thin line upon the shore328   nor are things all one way if we find mr gladstone writing to the queen of “the excellent parliamentary opening” of this man or that who made the worst possible parliamentary close there is the setoff of dull unmarked beginnings to careers that proved brilliant or weighty if there are a thousand absurdities in the form of claims for place and honours and steps in the peerage all the way up the ladder from a branch postoffice to the coveted blue riband of the garter “with no infernal nonsense of merit about it” there are on the other hand not a few modest and considerate refusals and we who have reasonable views of human nature may set in the balance against a score of the begging tribe the man of just pride who will not exchange his earldom for a marquisate and the honest peer who to the proffer of the garter says with gratitude evidently sincere “i regret however that i cannot conscientiously accept an honour which is beyond my deserts” then the octagon contains abundant material for any student of the lessons of a parliamentary crisis though perhaps the student knew before how even goodish people begin to waver in great causes when they first seriously suspect the horrid truth that they may not after all be in a majority many squibs caricatures and malicious diatribes dated in mr gladstone’s own hand find shelter but then compensation for faintheartedness or spite abounds in the letters of the staunch and these not from the party politicians merely mr gladstone stirred different and deeper waters the famous fighting bishop phillpotts of exeter then drawing on towards ninety and the realms of silence writes to him on the christmas day of 1863 “a christian statesman is a rare object of reverence and honour such i entirely believe are you i often remember the early days of my first intercourse with you your high principles gave an early dignity to your youth and promised the splendid earthly career which you are fulfilling i shall not live to witness that fulfilment” a whole generation later general booth wrote “throughout the world no people will pray more fervently and believingly for your continued life and happiness than the officers and soldiers of the salvation army” here is mr spurgeon the most popular and effective of the nonconforming preachers and workers of the time writing—       i felt ready to weep when you were treated with so much contumely     by your opponent in your former struggle and yet i rejoiced that     you were educating this nation to believe in conscience and     truth i wish i could brush away the gadflies but i suppose by     this time you have been stung so often that the system has become     invulnerable you are loved by hosts of us as intensely as you     are hated by certain of the savage party   and when mr gladstone was to visit spurgeon’s tabernacle jan 1882—       i feel like a boy who is to preach with his father to listen to     him i shall try not to know that you are there at all but just     preach to my poor people the simple word which has held them by     their thousands these twentyeight years you do not know how     those of us regard you who feel it a joy to live when a premier     believes in righteousness we believe in no man’s infallibility     but it is restful to be sure of one man’s integrity   that admirable sentence marks the secret  all the religious agitations of the time come before us eminent foreign converts from the roman church still find comfort in warning this most unshaken of believers against “a superficial and sceptical liberalism” others again condemned for heresy hail him as “dear and illustrious master”—with no cordial response we may surmise relying on mr gladstone’s character for humanheartedness and love of justice people submit to him some of the hard domestic problems then and so often forced upon the world by the quarrels of the churches one lady lays before him 1879 with superabundant detail a case where guardians insisted on the child of a mixed marriage being brought up as a protestant against the fervid wishes of the surviving parent a catholic mr gladstone masters the circumstances forms his judgment elaborates it in a closely argued memorandum and does not evade the responsibility of advising in another of these instances the tragedy is reversed the horrid oppression is perpetrated on the protestant mother by the catholic father and here too it is mr gladstone to whom the sufferer appeals for intercession  his correspondents have not always so much substance in them one lady of evangelical strain well known in her time writes to him about turbulence in ireland on the last day of 1880 the private secretary dockets “wishes you a blessed new year but goes on in a very impertinent strain attributing your ‘inaction’ in ireland to unprincipled colleagues and to want of heavenly guidance encloses suggestions for prayer” in such instances even when the appeal came near to raving mr gladstone whenever he thought the writer’s motives sincere seems to have replied with patience and at a length very different from the pithy brevity of the iron duke upon the like occasions sometimes we may assume that the secretary’s phlegmatic docket sufficed as on an epistle thus described “1 sends review in —— on his book 2 would like you to read —— and —— his poems 3 will send you soon his prose on —— 4 hopes you will not overwork yourself 5 his children call you st william” sometimes we know not whether it is simplicity or irony that inspires the grave politeness of his replies he seems to be in all sincerity surprised at the view taken by somebody “of the reluctance of public men to hold interviews for unexplained and indefinite purposes and their preference for written communications” somebody writes a pamphlet on points of the ministerial policy and suggests that each member of the government might order and distribute a competent number of copies mr gladstone immediately indicates two serious difficulties first that the ministers would then make themselves responsible for the writer’s opinion in detail no less than in mass and second their intervention would greatly detract from its weight even importunity for a subscription never makes him curt “i am sure you will not misconstrue me when i beg respectfully to state that your efforts will stand better without my personal cooperation”  m170 the correspondence is polyglot in one little bundle cavour writes in italian and french the archbishop of cephalonia congratulates him in greek on the first irish land bill and in the same tongue the archbishop of chios gives him a book on the union of the armenian with the anatolian communion huber regales him with the luxury of german cursivschrift the archimandrite myrianthes forwards him objects from the holy land the patriarch of constantinople 1896 sends greetings and blessings and testifies to the bonds of fellowship between the eastern and anglican churches undisturbed since the days of cyril lukaris dupanloup the famous bishop of orleans 1869 applauds the plan of juventus mundi its grandeur its beauty its moral elevation and proceeds to ask how he can procure copies of the articles on ecce homo as to which his curiosity has been aroused a couple of notes 1864 and 1871 from garibaldi the great revolutionist are neighbours to letters 185174 from guizot the great conservative three or four lines in french from garibaldi were given to mr gladstone the day before leaving cliveden and england april 24 1864 “in leaving you pray accept a word of recognition for all the kindness you have heaped upon me and for the generous interest you have at all times shown for the cause of my country—your devoted g garibaldi” the other shorter still 1871 begs him to do something for a french refugee minghetti ricasoli and others of that celebrated group commemorate his faithful and effective good will to italy daniel manin the venetian thanks him in admirable english for some books as well as for his energetic and courageous act in drawing a perfidious king naples before the bar of public opinion manzoni gives to a friend a letter of introduction 1845 and with italian warmth of phrase expresses his lively recollection of the day on which he made mr gladstone’s acquaintance and the admiration with which his name is followed mérimée the polished and fastidious genius presents to him a french consul at corfu 1858 who in his quality of philhellene and hellenist desires ardently to make the acquaintance of homer’s learned and eloquent commentator lesseps whose hand gave so tremendous and impressive a turn to forces policies currents of trade promises 1870 to keep an appointment when he will have the double honour of being presented to the princess louise by a man so universally respected for the high services he has rendered to the queen to his country and to the progress of the world  if the language is polyglot the topics are encyclopædic bishops send him their charges if a divine translates a hymn he submits it if he hits upon an argument on the mysteries of the faith or the vexed themes of theological debate he despatches pages and pages to hawarden and receives page upon page in reply young authors and especially young authoresses pestered him to review their books though his patience and good nature make ’pester’ seem an inapplicable word a scotch professor for some reason or another copies out and forwards to him one of goethe’s reflections and maxims—       how may a man attain to selfknowledge by contemplation     certainly not but by action try to do your duty and you will     find what you are fit for but what is your duty the demand of     the hour   as if of all men then living on our planet mr gladstone were not he to whom such counsel was most superfluous he replies oct 9 1880 “i feel the immense the overmastering power of goethe but with such limited knowledge as i have of his works i am unable to answer the question whether he has or has not been an evil genius of humanity”  m171 in 1839 spedding the baconian to whom years later the prime minister proposed that he should fill the chair of history at cambridge wrote to him that john sterling of whom mr gladstone already knew something was prevented by health from living in london and so by way of meeting his friends on his occasional visits had proposed that certain of them should agree to dine together cheaply once a month at some stated place as yet sterling had only spoken to carlyle john mill maurice and bingham baring “i hope” says spedding “that your devotion to the more general interests of mankind will not prevent your assisting in this little job” mr gladstone seems not to have assisted though his friend bishop wilberforce did and fell into some hot water in consequence a veteran and proclaimed freethinker sets out to mr gladstone his own recognition of what ought to be a truism that he is for every man being faithful to his faith that his aggressive denial of the inspiration of the bible did not prevent him from sending a copy in large type to his old mother to read when her eyes were dim that he respected consolations congenial to the conscience “i hope” he says to mr gladstone “there is a future life and if so my not being sure of it will not prevent it and i know of no better way of deserving it than by conscious service of humanity the universe never filled me with such wonder and awe as when i knew i could not account for it i admit ignorance is a privation but to submit not to know where knowledge is withheld seems but one of the sacrifices that reverence for truth imposes on us” the same correspondent speaks 1881 of “the noble toleration which you have personally shown me notwithstanding what you must think seriously erroneous views of mine and upon which i do not keep silence” mr gladstone had written to him six years before 1875 “differing from you i do not believe that secular motives are adequate either to propel or to restrain the children of our race but i earnestly desire to hear the other side and i appreciate the advantage of having it stated by sincere and highminded men” there is a letter too from the son of another conspicuous preacher of negation replying to some words of mr gladstone which he took to be disparaging of his parent and begging him “a lifelong idealist yourself” to think more worthily and sympathetically of one whom if he had known he would have appreciated and admired  a considerable correspondence is here from the learned bishop stubbs 1888 on the character of bishop fisher of rochester the fellowsufferer of more on the convocation act of 1531 and the other convocation acts of elizabeth on father walsh’s letters and other matters of the sixteenth century in fact it is safe to assume that mr gladstone has always some ecclesiastical historical theological controversy running alongside of the political and party business of the day nobody that ever lived tried to ride so many horses abreast another prelate puts a point that is worth remembering by every english school of foreign policy “in 1879” writes bishop creighton feb 15 1887 “when foreign affairs were much before the public i suggested to a publisher a series of books dealing quite shortly and clearly with the political history and constitution of the chief states of europe from 1815 i designed them for popular instruction thinking it of great importance that people in general should know what they were talking about when they spoke of france or russia the result of my attempt was to convince me that our ignorance of the last sixty years is colossal”  lord stanhope has been reading 1858 the “tusculan questions” and confides to mr gladstone’s sympathetic ear cicero’s shockingly faulty recollection of homer—mistaking euryclea for anticlea the nurse for the mother and giving to polyphemus a speech that polyphemus never spoke a bishop says macaulay told him that one of the most eloquent passages in the english language is in barrow’s seventyfifth sermon on the nativity—“let us consider that the nativity doth import the completion of many ancient promises”329 letters abound and overabound on that most movable of topics—“the present state of the homeric controversy” scott the lexicographer sends him greek epigrams on events too fugitive to be now worth recalling—discusses homeric points and while not surrendering at discretion admits them worthy of much consideration there are many pages from thirlwall that great scholar and enlightened man upon points of homeric ethnology homeric geography and such questions as whether a line in the iliad xiv 321 makes the mother of minos to be a phœnician damsel or the daughter of phœnix or whether it is possible to attach a meaning to ἐννέωρος that would represent minos as beginning his reign when nine years old—a thing the grave bishop adds even more strange than the passion of dante for beatrice at the same age  m172 huxley sends him titles of books on the origin of the domestic horse sir joseph hooker supplies figures of the girth of giant trees the number of annual rings in a fallen stump which would seem to give it 6420 years tells him how the wood of another was as sound after 380 years as if just felled somebody else interests him in helmholtz’s experiments on the progression of the vibrations of the true vowel sounds letters pass between him and darwin 1879 on colours and names for colours darwin suggests the question whether savages have names for shades of colours “i should expect that they have not and this would be remarkable for the indians of chili and tierra del fuego have names for every slight promontory and hill to a marvellous degree” mr gladstone proposes to nominate him a trustee of the british museum april 1881 and darwin replies “i would gladly have accepted had my strength been sufficient for anything like regular attendance at the meetings” professor owen thanks him for the honour of knight of the bath and expresses his true sense of the aid and encouragement that he has uniformly received from mr gladstone throughout the course of the labours from which he is now retiring  he corresponds with a learned french statesman not on the insoluble newfoundland problem turning so much on the nice issue whether a lobster is a fish and not on the vexed egyptian question but on the curious prohibition of pork as an article of food—a strange contradiction between the probable practice of the phœnicians and that of the jews perpetuated in our times through all mussulman countries and a prohibition not to be explained on sanitary grounds because to the present day christians in the east all indulge in pork and are none the worse for it a young member of parliament one night fell into conversation with him as a branch from the subject of the eating of bovine flesh by the greeks on the eating of horseflesh and the next day writes to mention to him that at a council in 785 with the bishop of ostia as president it was decreed “many among you eat horses which is not done by any christians in the east avoid this” and he asks mr gladstone whether he believed that by reason of the high estimation in which the greeks held the horse they abstained from his flesh mr gladstone august 1889 replies that while on his guard against speaking with confidence about the historic period he thought he was safe in saying that the greeks did not eat the horse in the heroic period and he refers to passages in this book and the other “it was only a conjecture however on my part that the near relation of the horse to human feeling and life may probably have been the cause that prevented the consumption of horseflesh” in a further letter he refers his correspondent to the closing part of the englishman in paris for some curious particulars on hippophagy then he seems to have interested himself in a delicate question as to the personal claims of socrates in the light of a moral reformer and the sage’s accommodation of moral sentiment to certain existing fashions in athenian manners but as i have not his side of the correspondence i can only guess that his point was the inferiority of the moral ideals of socrates to those of christ gustave d’eichthal one of the celebrated group of saintsimonians who mingled so much of what was chimerical with much that was practical and fruitful draws the attention of mr gladstone statesman philosopher and hellenist to writings of his own on the practical use of greek as destined to be the great national language of humanity perhaps even within the space of two or three generations guizot begs him to accept his book on peel and thanking him for his article on the “royal supremacy” feb 9 1864 says further what must have given mr gladstone lively satisfaction—       like you i could wish that the anglican church had more     independence and selfgovernment but such as it is and taking     all its history into account i believe that of all the christian     churches it is that in which the spiritual régime is best     reconciled with the political and the rights of divine tradition     with those of human liberty i shall probably send you in the     course of this year some meditations on the essence and history of     the christian religion europe is in an antichristian crisis and     having come near the term of life i have it much at heart to mark     my place in this struggle   m173 for some reason henry taylor encloses him april 5 1837 “a letter written by southey the other day to a wild girl who sent him some rhapsodies of her writing and told him she should be in an agony till she should receive his opinion of them” this recalls a curious literary incident for the “wild girl” was charlotte brontë and southey warned her that “literature cannot be the business of a woman’s life and ought not to be” and yet his letter was both sensible and kind though as time showed it was a bad shot330 thackeray has been asked to breakfast but “i only got your note at 2 o’clock this afternoon when the tea would have been quite cold and next thursday am engaged to lecture at exeter so that i can’t hope to breakfast with you i shall be absent from town some three weeks and hope mrs gladstone will permit me to come to see her on my return” froude who was often at his breakfasts gives him a book year doubtful “i took the liberty of sending it you merely as an expression of the respect and admiration that i have felt towards you for many years”—sentiments that hardly stood the wear and tear of time and circumstance  in 1850 what macaulay styles a most absurd committee was appointed to devise inscriptions for medals to be given to the exhibitors at the great worldshow of next year its members were besides macaulay himself and gladstone milman liddell lyttelton charles merivale milman bethought him of looking into claudian and sent to mr gladstone three or four alternative lines fished out from the last of the poets of roman paganism macaulay had another idea—       my dear gladstone—i am afraid that we must wait till thursday i     do not much like taking words from a passage certainly obscure     and probably corrupt could we not do better ourselves i have     made no latin verses these many years but i will venture i send     you three attempts—      pulcher et ille labor pulchros ornare labores     pulchrum etiam pulchros palma donare labores     pulchrum etiam pulchris meritam decernere palmam      you will easily make better if we can produce a tolerable line     among us we may pretend as lardner did that it is in     haphorstrus or masenius—yours ever      t b macaulay   francis newman the cardinal’s highminded and accomplished brother writes to mr gladstone 1878 in a strain of exalted recognition of his services to the nation and quotes a little oddly perhaps the beautiful lines in euripides foretelling the approaching triumph of dionysus over his mortal foe331  the poets are not absent wordsworth as we have already seen i p 269 n sends to him at the board of trade his remonstrance and his sonnet on the railway into windermere tennyson addresses to him for his personal behoof the sonnet upon the redistribution bill of 1884—       “steersman be not precipitate in thine act     of steering ”   and on a sheet of notepaper at a later date when irish selfgovernment was the theme he copies the greek lines from pindar “how easy a thing it is even for men of light weight to shake a state how hard to build it up again”332 rogers 1844 insists that “if one may judge from experience perhaps the best vehicle in our language for a translator of verse is prose he who doubts it has only to open his bible who could wish the stories of joseph and of ruth to be otherwise than they are or who but would rejoice if the iliad and the odyssey were so translated i once asked porson to attempt it and he seemed to like the idea but said that it would be a labour of ten or twelve years”  m174 there was one true poet and not only a poet but a man as we now see with far truer insight into the intellectual needs of his countrymen than any other writer of the closing quarter of the century who is sometimes supposed to have been overlooked by mr gladstone and here in the octagon is matthew arnold’s letter soliciting his recommendation 1867 for the strictly prosaic post of librarian of the house of commons which happily he did not obtain the year before arnold had wished to be made a commissioner under the endowed schools act but a lawyer was rightly thought necessary by lord russell or his advisers and there is no good reason to suppose that mr gladstone meddled either way he was responsible in 1882 for a third disappointment but here again it has been truly said that to appoint to the charity commission a man of sixty who had no intimate knowledge of charity law and who had recently in his articles irritated all the nonconformists in england by his ironical references to dissent and dissenters would not have been conducive to the efficient transaction of public business a year later mr gladstone proffered him and his friends made him accept a civil list pension of two hundred and fifty pounds a year “in public recognition of service to the poetry and literature of england” arnold in a letter here tries to soften mr gladstone’s heart on the subject of copyright on which as i often made bold to tell him he held some rather flagrant heresies here the poet begs the minister to consider whether an english author ought not to have property in his work for a longer time than he has now “for many books the sale begins late the author has to create as wordsworth said the taste by which he is to be enjoyed such an author is surely the very man one would wish to protect” i fear he made no convert  another poet with no eye on patronage or pension hopes to be permitted to say 1869 “how very many of your countrymen whom you have forgotten or never saw follow your noble and courageous development of legislation with the same personal devotion gratitude and gladness that i feel” then five years later he still assures him that among men of letters he may have antagonists but he cannot have enemies—rather a fine distinction with painfully little truth in it as things happened  to miss martineau who had done hard work in more than one good cause he proposes a pension which she honourably declines “the work of my busy years has supplied the needs of a quiet old age on the former occasions of my declining a pension i was poor and it was a case of scruple possibly cowardice now i have a competence and there would be no excuse for my touching the public money you will need no assurance that i am as grateful for your considerate offer as if it had relieved me of a wearing anxiety”  in 1885 he wrote to mr watts the illustrious painter to request with the sanction of the queen that he would allow himself to be enrolled among the baronets of the united kingdom “it gives me lively pleasure” he said “to have the means of thus doing honour to art in the person of so distinguished a representative of the noble pursuit” mr watts in words that i am permitted to transcribe declined as he did also a second time in 1894 when the proposal was repeated       while i feel very strongly and acknowledge with sincere     gratitude that you have honoured in my person making me a sort     of standard bearer the pursuit of art for its own sake and have     so afforded an enduring encouragement to those who like myself     may be willing to relinquish many good and tangible things for     purposes believed to be good but not likely to meet with general     sympathy still i feel it would be something like a real disgrace     to accept for work merely attempted reward and payment only due     to work achieved i should have the ghost of the lycian chief     reproaching me in my dreams also the objects to which i wish to     dedicate the rest of my life will best be carried out in quiet and     obscurity so please do not be vexed with me if i again beg     respectfully and gratefully to decline sarpedon’s words333     always ring in my ears and so i think you will understand the     things i cannot attempt to say i am so far from undervaluing     distinctions that i should like to be a duke and deserve the     title still it is true that living mainly in a world of my     own my views are narrowed i hope i may also say simplified     till a sense of the four great conditions which to my mind     comprise all that can be demonstrated of our existence life and     death light and darkness so dominate my mental vision that they     almost become material entities and take material forms dwarfing     and casting into shadow ordinary considerations over the two     first human efforts broadly speaking avail nothing but we have     it in our power to modify the two last of course i include in the     terms all that belongs to good and bad beauty and ugliness     labouring by the side of the poet and the statesman the artist     may deal with those great issues and here i think the art of     england has been at fault your overestimate of my work has     hastened the execution of an intention i have long had and which     indeed amounts to retirement from the ranks of professional men i     have concluded dating from june to undertake no portraits and     accept no commissions but contented with the little i have to     live upon work only with the idea of making my efforts worthy at     least as efforts of the nation’s acceptance alike before and     after my death   “you have adopted a resolution” said mr gladstone in his reply “of the kind that makes the nineteenth century stare or blink as those blink who stand in a great brightness and have not eyes for it the course that you purpose is indeed a selfdenying an unworldly and a noble one”  m175 one packet touches a matter that at the moment did mr gladstone some harm in the judgment of men whose good opinion was worth having in 1873 john stuart mill died and a public memorial was proposed mr gladstone intimated that he was willing to cooperate then a liberal clergyman attacked the obituary notice in the times as too frigid and the author of the notice retorted by tales of mill’s early views on the question of population he was well acquainted with mr gladstone and set busily to work to persuade him that mill in his book on political economy advocated obnoxious checks that he was vaguely associated with american publications on the matter and that he did not believe in god which was not to the point mr gladstone passed on this tissue of innuendo to the duke of argyll the duke reported that he had consulted men thoroughly conversant both with mill and his writings that he was assured no passage could bear the construction imputed and that the places which he had himself looked into clearly referred to prudential restraints on marriage certainly a school of social economy that deals only with foreign exchanges and rent and values and the virtues of direct taxes and indirect and draws the curtain around the question of population must be a singularly shallow affair the duke of argyll manfully brushed wasps aside and sent his subscription so did men as orthodox as lord salisbury and as cautious as lord derby mr gladstone on the other hand wrote to the promoters of the memorial “in my view this painful controversy still exists i feel that it is not possible for me situated as i am at the present time to decide it or to examine it with a view to decision the only course open to me is to do no act involving a judgment either way and therefore while i desire to avoid any public step whatever i withdraw from cooperation and request that my name may be no further mentioned” unfortunately the withdrawal of such a name could not be other than a public step to say moreover that the controversy still existed was to go a longish way in public opinion towards deciding it the curious thing is that mr gladstone had known mill so well—his singleminded love of truth his humanity his passion for justice—as to call him by the excellent name of “the saint of rationalism” a saint of any sort is surely uncommon enough in our fallen world to claim an equity that is not refused to sinners yet fifteen years later he wrote a letter doing mill more justice “of all the motives stings and stimulants” he wrote “that reach men through their egoism in parliament no part could move or even touch him his conduct and his language were in this respect a sermon again though he was a philosopher he was not i think a man of crotchets he had the good sense and practical tact of politics together with the high independent thought of a recluse”334  a learned unitarian beard sends him a volume of hibbert lectures “all systems” mr gladstone writes in acknowledging it “have their slang but what i find in almost every page of your book is that you have none” he complains however of finding augustine put into a leash with luther and calvin “augustine’s doctrine of human nature is substantially that of bishop butler and he converted me about fortyfive years ago to butler’s doctrine” of far earlier date than this 1839 is an interesting letter from montalembert—       london july 4 1839—it seems to me that amidst many     dissentimens and although you pass generally in this country     for an enemy to my faith and my church there is a link between     us since admitting every superiority of talent and influence on     your side we stand on the same ground in public life—that of the     inalienable rights of spiritual power i have therefore received     your book with gratitude and read it with the sincerest interest     i now take the liberty of offering you a portion of the work i     have published not on matter of actual controversy but on an     unknown and delightful subject of religious history if you ever     find leisure enough to throw a glance on the history of st     elizabeth and more particularly on the introduction which is     a rapid résumé of the thirteenth century you will perhaps gain     some slight information on what the rev hugh mcneile so     appropriately called “the filth and falsehood of the middle ages”     in his splendid speech on church extension at freemasons’ hall a     few days ago and allow me to add my dear sir with the utter     frankness which i cannot divest myself of that what you seem to     me to stand the most in need of at present is a deeper and more     original knowledge of the laws and events of catholic europe   then come others recalling illustrious names and famous events in english history there are a dozen letters of business 18371846 from the duke of wellington the reader may be curious to see the earliest communication between two such men—       london nov 27 1837—i have by accident mislaid the petition     from the cape of good hope if it was ever sent me but i shall be     happy to see you and converse with you upon the subject and     consider whether it is desirable or possible that i can bring the     subject before the consideration of the house of lords at the same     time that you will in the h of c i would propose to you to come     here or that i should go to

much i appreciate your considerate sympathy my wife had     always a strong personal regard for you and being of a vivid and     original character she could comprehend and value your great     gifts and qualities there is a ray of hope under this roof since     the last four and twenty hours round your hearth i trust health     and happiness will be ever present—yours sincerely b disraeli   six years later when lady beaconsfield died mr gladstone wrote jan 19 1873—       dear mr disraeli—my reluctance to intrude on the sacredness and     freshness of your sorrow may now i think properly give way to a     yet stronger reluctance to forego adding our small but very     sincere tribute of sympathy to those abundant manifestations of it     which have been yielded in so many forms you and i were as i     believe married in the same year it has been permitted to both     of us to enjoy a priceless boon through a third of a century     spared myself the blow which has fallen on you i can form some     conception of what it must have been and must be i do not presume     to offer you the consolation which you will seek from another and     higher quarter i offer only the assurance which all who know you     and all who knew lady beaconsfield and especially those among     them who like myself enjoyed for a length of time her marked     though unmerited regard may perhaps tender without impropriety     the assurance that in this trying hour they feel deeply for you     and with you—believe me sincerely yours      w e gladstone      hughenden manor jan 24 1873—dear mr gladstone—i am much     touched by your kind words in my great sorrow i trust i     earnestly trust that you may be spared a similar affliction     marriage is the greatest earthly happiness when founded on     complete sympathy that hallowed lot was mine and for a moiety of     my existence and i know it is yours—with sincere regard d   a last note with the quavering penstrokes of old age nov 6 1888 comes from the hand soon to grow cold of one who had led so strange a revolution and had stood for so much in the movement of things that to mr gladstone were supreme—       it is a great kindness and compliment your wishing to see me i     have known and admired you so long but i cannot write nor talk     nor walk and hope you will take my blessing which i give from my     heart—yours most truly john h card newman   so the perpetual whirl of life revolves “by nature an unmanageable sight” but—       not wholly so to him who looks     in steadiness who hath among least things     an undersense of greatest sees the parts     as parts but with a feeling of the whole337   such steadiness such undersense and feeling of the whole was mr gladstone’s gift and inspiration never expending itself in pensive musings upon the vain ambitions illusions cheats regrets of human life—such moods of halfmorbid moralising were not in his temperament—but ever stirring him to duty and manful hope to intrepid selfdenial and iron effort     chapter iv eastern question once more 18761877       the dead have been awakened—shall i sleep       the world’s at war with tyrants—shall i crouch     the

is a large packet of notes on “future retribution” and on them is the docket “from this i was called away to write on bulgaria” in the spring of 1876 the turkish volcano had burst into flame of the crimean war the reader has already seen enough and too much338 its successes in mr gladstone’s words by a vast expenditure of french and english life and treasure gave to turkey for the first time perhaps in her bloodstained history twenty years of a repose not disturbed either by herself or by any foreign power as cobden and bright had foreseen as even many european statesmen who approved the war on grounds of their own had foreseen turkish engagements were broken for this solid reason if for no other that turkey had not in the resources of her barbaric polity the means to keep them  fierce revolt against intolerable misrule slowly blazed up in bosnia and herzegovina and a rising in bulgaria not dangerous in itself was put down by turkish troops despatched for the purpose from constantinople with deeds described by the british agent who investigated them on the spot as the most heinous crimes that had stained the history of the century the consuls of france and germany at salonica were murdered by the turkish mob servia and montenegro were in arms moved by these symptoms of a vast conflagration the three imperial courts of russia austria and germany agreed upon an instrument imposing on the turk certain reforms to be carried out under european supervision to this instrument known as the berlin memorandum england along with france and italy was invited to adhere may 13 the two other powers assented but mr disraeli and his cabinet refused—a proceeding that along with more positive acts was taken by the turk and other people to assure the moral support of great britain to the ottoman and probably to threaten military support against the russian  m176 this rejection of the berlin memorandum in may marked the first decisive moment in british policy the withdrawal of england from the concert of europe the lurid glare of the atrocities in bulgaria and his abiding sense of the responsibility imposed upon us by the crimean war and all its attendant obligations were the three main elements in the mighty storm that now agitated mr gladstone’s breast perhaps his sympathies with the eastern church had their share in a fragment of reminiscence twenty years after he says—       when in 1876 the eastern question was forced forward by the     disturbances in the turkish empire and especially by the cruel     outrages in bulgaria i shrank naturally but perhaps unduly from     recognising the claim they made upon me individually i hoped that     the ministers would recognise the moral obligations to the subject     races of the east which we had in honour contracted as parties to     the crimean war and to the peace of paris in 1856 i was slow to     observe the real leanings of the prime minister his strong     sympathy with the turk and his mastery in his own cabinet i     suffered others forster in particular to go far ahead of me at     the close of the session 1876 a debate was raised upon the     subject and i had at length been compelled to perceive that the     old idol was still to be worshipped at constantinople and that     as the only person surviving in the house of commons who had been     responsible for the crimean war and the breaking of the bulwark     raised by the treaty of kainardji on behalf of the eastern     christians i could no longer remain indifferent consequently in     that debate mr disraeli had to describe my speech as the only one     that had exhibited a real hostility to the policy of the     government it was however at that time an opposition without     hope i went into the country and had mentally postponed all     further action to the opening of the next session when i learned     from the announcement of a popular meeting to be held in hyde park     that the question was alive339 so i at once wrote and published     on the bulgarian case from that time forward till the final     consummation in 187980 i made the eastern question the main     business of my life i acted under a strong sense of individual     duty without a thought of leadership nevertheless it made me     again leader whether i would or no the nation nobly responded to     the call of justice and recognised the brotherhood of man but it     was the nation not the classes when at the close of the session     of 1876 there was the usual dispersion in pursuit of recreation     i thought the occasion was bad it was good for the nation did     not disperse and the human heart was beating when the clubs     refilled in october the turkish cause began again to make head     then came a chequered period and i do not recollect to have     received much assistance from the “front bench” even granville     had been a little startled at my proceedings and wished me to     leave out the “bag and baggage” from my pamphlet   before the end of the session of 1876 mr disraeli quitted the house of commons and became the earl of beaconsfield lord granville informed mr gladstone on the authority of a high personage that disraeli had said to the queen he must resign “that the peerage was then suggested that at first he said ‘yes but accompanied with resignation’ but was told that in the present state of europe that was impossible” in reporting to sir arthur gordon then abroad what was not merely a piece of news but an event mr gladstone says aug 16—       disraeli assumes his earldom amidst loud acclaims i had better be     mute about him and his influence generally except as to a full     acknowledgment of his genius and his good points of character his     government is supposed now to stand mainly upon its recent foreign     policy the most selfish and least worthy i have ever known     whatever was open to any degree of exception in palmerston has     this year received a tenfold development in disraeli derby’s     influence i think has been for good but too little of it   to the duke of argyll a couple of days before he had written—       i am entirely in harmony with you as to your view of the eastern     policy it has been depressing and corrupting to the country a     healthier air has been generated by indignation at the bulgarian     massacres which have thrown us back on our rather forgotten     humanity i hope the subject will not slumber through the recess     dizzy’s speech so i call him with all due respect to the peerage     in the turkish debate gave me a new light on his views he is not     quite such a turk as i had thought what he hates is christian     liberty and reconstruction he supports old turkey thinking that     if vital improvements can be averted it must break down and his     fleet is at besika bay i feel pretty sure to be ready to lay     hold of egypt as his share so he may end as the duke of memphis     yet    ii   then came the pamphlet the story of this memorable publication is told in the diary—       aug 28 1876—church 8½ am worked on a beginning for a     possible pamphlet on the turkish question i stupidly brought on     again my lumbago by physical exertion was obliged to put off my     pamphlet read the salvation of all men  29—kept my bed     long wrote to lord granville etc  and as a treat began     waverley once more lumbago bad 30—much bed forswear all     writing read st thomas aquinas on the soul waverley a     snug evening in the temple of peace 31—kept my bed till four     and made tolerable play in writing on bulgarian horrors sept     1—wrote 16 letters again worked hard in bed and sent off more     than half to the printers read waverley short drive with c     2—this day i wrote again a good piece of the pamphlet in bed but     improved considerably rose at four read waverley in the     evening 3—hawarden church 11 am and 6½ pm wrote 16     letters off at 1015 pm for london 4—reached 18 cht at     five in the morning by limited mail bed till nine saw lord     granville mr delane sir a panizzi mr clowes messrs murray     the american minister in six or seven hours principally at the     british museum i completed my ms making all the needful     searches of papers and journals also worked on proof sheets      to mrs gladstone—we had an interesting little party at     granville’s i had a long talk with delane we he and i are much     of one mind in thinking the turks must go out of bulgaria though     retaining a titular supremacy if they like between ourselves     granville a little hangs back from this but he could not persuade     me to hold it back      5—  saw lord granville lord hartington finished the     correction of revises before one discussing the text with lord     granville and making various alterations of phrase which he     recommended at seven i received complete copies we went to the     haymarket theatre arranged my papers after this and sent off     copies in various directions   m177 the pamphlet spread like fire340 within three or four days of its first appearance forty thousand copies had gone it was instantly followed up by a tremendous demonstration among his constituents “sept 9 1876—thought over my subject for blackheath off at two a very large meeting the most enthusiastic far that i ever saw spoke over an hour” this is his very prosaic story of the first of those huge and excited multitudes of which for months and years to come he was to confront so many the pamphlet and the blackheath speech were his rejoinder to the light and callous tones of mr disraeli and the sceptical language of his foreign secretary “i have a strong suspicion” he told the duke of argyll who was a fervent sympathiser “that dizzy’s cryptojudaism has had to do with his policy the jews of the east bitterly hate the christians who have not always used them well” this suspicion was constant “disraeli” he said to mr gladstone “may be willing to risk his government for his judaic feeling—the deepest and truest now that his wife has gone in his whole mind”  the tract beats with a sustained pulse and passion that recall burke’s letters on the regicide peace the exhortation against moral complicity with “the basest and blackest outrages upon record within the present century if not within the memory of man” the branding of the turkish race as “the one great antihuman specimen of humanity” the talk of “fell satanic orgies” the declaration that there was not a criminal in a european gaol nor a cannibal in the south sea islands whose indignation would not rise at the recital of that which had been done which remained unavenged which had left behind all the foul and all the fierce passions that produced it and might again spring up in another murderous harvest from the soil soaked and reeking with blood and in the air tainted with every imaginable deed of crime and shame—all this vehemence was hailed with eager acclamation by multitudes who felt all that he felt and found in his passionate invective words and a voice mr gladstone was not the man his readers and his public were not the men for mere denunciation they found in him a policy indignation he said in a thoroughly characteristic sentence indignation is froth except as it leads to action mere remonstrance is mockery there are states of affairs he told them in which human sympathy refuses to be confined by the rules necessarily limited and conventional of international law servia and montenegro in going to war against turkey might plead human sympathies broad deep and legitimate and that they committed no moral offence the policy of the british government was the status quo “as you were” this meant the maintenance of turkish executive authority what was really needed was the total withdrawal of the administrative rule of the turk and here he used words that became very famous in the controversy—       but i return to and end with that which is the omega as well as     the alpha of this great and most mournful case an old servant of     the crown and state i entreat my countrymen upon whom far more     than perhaps any other people of europe it depends to require and     to insist that our government which has been working in one     direction shall work in the other and shall apply all its vigour     to concur with the other states of europe in obtaining the     extinction of the turkish executive power in bulgaria let the     turks now carry away their abuses in the only possible manner     namely by carrying off themselves their zaptiehs and their     mudirs their bimbashis and their yuzbashis their kaimakams and     their pashas one and all bag and baggage shall i hope clear out     from the province they have desolated and profaned   at blackheath under dripping rain clouds he said the same though with the invective tempered “you shall receive your regular tribute” he said in slow sentences to imaginary ottomans whom he seemed to hold before his visual eye “you shall retain your titular sovereignty your empire shall not be invaded but never again as the years roll in their course so far as it is in our power to determine never again shall the hand of violence be raised by you never again shall the floodgates of lust be open to you never again shall the dire refinements of cruelty be devised by you for the sake of making mankind miserable”  once again it was not words that made the power of the orator it was the relation in purpose feeling and conviction between him and his audience he forced them into unity with himself by the vivid strength of his resolution and imagination he could not believe that his own power of emotion was not theirs too—       on monday morning last between four and five o’clock i was     rattling down from euston station through the calm and silent     streets of london when there was not a footfall to disturb them     every house looked so still that it might well have been a     receptacle of the dead but as i came through those long lines of     streets i felt it to be an inspiring and a noble thought that in     every one of these houses there were intelligent human beings my     fellowcountrymen who when they woke would give many of their     earliest thoughts aye and some of their most energetic actions     to the terrors and sufferings of bulgaria   all this was the very spirit of milton’s imperishable sonnet upon the late massacre in piedmont the spirit that made cromwell say that the slaughter in the waldensian valleys “came as near to his heart as if his own nearest and dearest had been concerned”  m178 lord stratford de redcliffe who had been one of the most responsible promoters of the policy of the crimean war told mr gladstone of his own strong impression sept 10 that the formidable crisis would not have arisen had england in the first instance taken part with the other powers not that he believed that russia was always and fully trustworthy but she was so circumstanced then as to be open to the full bearing of our moral influence six weeks later lord stratford again expressed his unaltered opinion that if in the beginning england had taken her place at the side of the three emperors the cloud on the horizon would never have swelled out into its present colossal proportions “it seems to me” he said “that russia has been gradually drawn into a position from which she can hardly retreat with credit” “whatever shades of difference appear in our opinions” he told mr gladstone in september “may be traced in a great measure to your having made bulgaria the main object of your appeal whereas the whole eastern question was my theme and the bulgarian atrocities execrable as they were only a part of it” the truth was that in making the atrocious doings in bulgaria the main object of his appeal mr gladstone had both displayed a sure instinct as to the most effective method of popular approach and at the same time did justice to his own burning and innate hatred of all cruelty and oppression whether in bourbon or bashibazouk humanity was at the root of the whole matter and the keynote of this great crusade was the association of humanity with a high policy worthy of the british name  october was passed in a round of visits to great houses the popular tide in the north still appearing to rise around him to lord granville he writes—       alnwick castle oct 3 1876—we have advanced thus far in a     northern and eastern tour and we hope to be at castle howard on     wednesday i left home at this particular time partly with ideas     of health and relaxation partly because i thought that being     everywhere and nowhere i should escape a little from the turmoil     of the time through cheshire and lancashire we accomplished the     first stage of our journey to raby without witnessing any     particular indication of public sentiment and this rather     encouraged our extending a little the circle of our visits which     i am now half tempted to regret for at every point i have had the     greatest difficulty in maintaining any show of privacy and     avoiding strong manifestations i never saw such keen exhibitions     of the popular feeling appearing so to pervade all ranks and     places a tory county member said to my wife two days ago “if     there were a dissolution now i should not get a vote” this may     be in some degree peculiar to the northerners with their strong     character and deep emotions      castle howard oct 7 1876—before receiving your letter of the     5th i had been driven to the conclusion that i must make a     further utterance following the actual course of the     transactions and upon the whole i adhere to this conclusion     notwithstanding your opinion to which i attach great weight     there is a great difference in our situations which i think     accounts for this difference of view i found ailesbury of     course full of friendship and loyalty to you but disposed to     regret that you had not been able to see your way to a more     advanced and definite policy i told him that i found no cause for     surprise in your reserve and thought you held yourself in hand     for the purpose of holding your party in hand—a view which i think     he more or less embraced now i have not your responsibilities to     the party but i have for the moment more than your     responsibilities to the country in this sense that i feel myself     compelled to advise from time to time upon the course of that     national movement which i have tried hard to evoke and assist in     evoking i regard myself as an outside workman engaged in the     preparation of materials which you and the party will probably     have to manipulate and then to build into a structure for though     i do not wish to shut the door upon the government i despair of     them after so many invitations and so many refusals   m179 to madame novikoff a russian lady who at this time began to exercise a marked influence upon the opinions of important men with much influence on the opinions of many other people341 he indicated some doubtful symptoms—       hawarden oct 17 1876—there is an undoubted and smart rally     on behalf of turkey in the metropolitan press it is in the main     representative of the ideas and opinions of what are called the     upper ten thousand from this body there has never on any occasion     within my memory proceeded the impulse that has prompted and     finally achieved any of the great measures which in the last     half century have contributed so much to the fame and happiness of     england they did not emancipate the dissenters roman catholics     and jews they did not reform the parliament they did not     liberate the negro slave they did not abolish the corn law they     did not take the taxes off the press they did not abolish the     irish established church they did not cheer on the work of     italian freedom and reconstitution yet all these things have been     done and done by other agencies than theirs and despite their     opposition when i speak of them i speak of course of the     majority among them unhappily the country is understood abroad     mainly through the metropolitan press   he was no sooner back at hawarden than he fell to work on subsidiary branches of the question of questions       oct 22—worked hard and finished my paper on russia in     turkestan and sent it off criminal justice on sunday but it is     for peace 24—to london 27—up at 6 went with harry to dover     saw him off on board the packet and pier on his way to india     drove over to walmer reviewed the place saw lord granville and     sir w james returned to london and at 930 to the gaiety saw a     miserable burlesque of which i had heard a most inviting but false     account 28—to hawarden 31—tennyson and h t came nov     1—tennyson read to us his harold it took near 2½ hours walk     with him and a party 2—read bagehot on lord spencer’s     life—very clever very imperfect conversation with tennyson on     future retribution and other matters of theology he has not     thought i conceive systematically or thoroughly upon them but     is much alarmed at the prospect of the loss of belief he left us     at one walk and long conversation with lord acton who seems in     opinion to go beyond döllinger though in certain things he stops     short of him 8—read aloud the debate of the first iliad from     pope 9—read aloud my version of the assembly—iliad i 10—read     aloud lord derby’s and cowper’s version of the assembly 14—the     olympian part of iliad i in pope’s version aloud and then my     own 17—we went to liverpool where we attended the theatre to     see pennington in hamlet it was really excellent i never was     so well received in that town 21—finished revision of my ms     “the hellenic factor in the eastern problem” and sent it to     press    iii   at the lord mayor’s feast in november the prime minister used menacing language the policy of england he said was peace but no country was so well prepared for war as ours if england were to enter into a righteous war her resources were inexhaustible “she is not a country that when she enters into a campaign has to ask herself whether she can support a second or a third campaign she enters into a campaign which she will not terminate till right is done” this was a hardly veiled threat to russia it was encouragement to turkey it was incitement to a war party in great britain “the provocation offered by disraeli at the guildhall” wrote mr gladstone “is almost incredible some new lights about his judaic feeling in which he is both consistent and conscientious have come in upon me”  still the general feeling was strongly adverse to any action on behalf of turkey mr gladstone eagerly noted even the most trivial incident that pointed this way “yesterday night” he wrote nov 26 “in the tory town of liverpool when othello was being acted and the words were reached ‘the turks are drowned’ the audience rose in enthusiasm and interrupted the performance for some time with their cheering these things are not without meaning” men who commonly stood aside from political activity were roused “mr carlyle” says mr ruskin “mr froude and several other men of creditable name gathered together at call of mr gladstone as for a great national need together with other men of more retired mind—edward burnejones for one and myself for another”  m180 the reply to the guildhall speech was a conference at st james’s hall dec 8 one of the most remarkable gatherings of representative men of every type and from every part of the kingdom ever held in this country “i have most flourishing accounts of the progress of preparations for the conference of which i have been a promoter from the beginning they urge me to speak on the 8th but i should much prefer that others should put themselves in the foreground” besides the eminent politicians great territorial magnates were there and men of letters and divines of various churches and men who had never been to a militant assembly in their lives before—all with a resolute purpose expressed by mr trevelyan “no matter how the prime minister may finger the hilt of the sword the nation will take care that it never leaves the scabbard” mr gladstone reached london a day or two before on the 8th he enters—       8—made notes and extracts for speech attended the meetings at     st james’s hall 121½ and 48 spoke i fear 1½ hours with     some exertion far from wholly to my satisfaction the meetings     were great notable almost historical      the day after this important and impressive gathering he was back     at hawarden busy at his article upon the life of the prince     consort then came christmas day—“the most solemn i have known     for long i see that eastward sky of storm and of underlight”   at a suggestion from the london foreign office a conference of the great powers met at constantinople in the middle of december lord salisbury went as the representative of england to a correspondent mr gladstone spoke of this as an excellent selection—       i think it right at once to give you my opinion of lord salisbury     whom i know pretty well in private he has little foreign or     eastern knowledge and little craft he is rough of tongue in     public debate but a great gentleman in private society he is     very remarkably clever of unsure judgment but is above anything     mean has no disraelite prejudices keeps a conscience and has     plenty of manhood and character in a word the appointment of lord     salisbury to constantinople is the best thing the government have     yet done in the eastern question   as the conference met so it ran a usual course and then vanished the powers were in complete accord as to the demands that were to be made upon turkey for the protection of the unfortunate christian rayahs the turk in just confidence that he should find a friend rejected them and the envoys departed to their homes mr gladstone however found comfort in the thought that by the agitation two points had been gained the reestablishment of the european concert and extrication from a disgraceful position of virtual complicity with turkey  in the spring of 1877 he wrote a second pamphlet342 because a speech in the house could not contain detail enough and because parliamentary tradition almost compelled a suspension of discussion while ministers were supposed to be engaged in concert with other powers in devising a practical answer to russian inquiry he found that it “produced no great impression” the sale not going beyond six or seven thousand copies still the gala remained from the proceeding in the autumn that the government dared not say they had nothing to do with the condition of the christian rayahs of turkey and any idea of going to war for turkey was out of the question  public feeling had waxed very hot yet without any clear precision of opinion or purpose on the side opposed to mr gladstone’s policy of emancipation dean church dec 1876 describes how “everybody was very savage with everybody about turks and russians i think i never remember such an awkward time for meeting people until you know you are on the same side except at the height of the tractarian row”343  m181 a little later we have one of the best pictures of him that i know from the warm and vivid hand of j r green the historian—       feb 21 1877—last night i met gladstone—it will always be a     memorable night to me stubbs was there and goldwin smith and     humphry sandwith and mackenzie wallace whose great book on     russia is making such a stir besides a few other nice people but     one forgets everything in gladstone himself in his perfect     naturalness and grace of manner his charming abandon of     conversation his unaffected modesty his warm ardour for all that     is noble and good i felt so proud of my leader—the chief i have     always clung to through good report and ill report—because wise     or unwise as he might seem in this or that he was always noble of     soul he was very pleasant to me and talked of the new historic     school he hoped we were building up as enlisting his warmest     sympathy i wish you could have seen with what a glow he spoke of     the montenegrins and their struggle for freedom how he called on     us who wrote history to write what we could of that long fight for     liberty and all through the evening not a word to recall his     greatness amongst us simple natural an equal among his equals     listening to every one drawing out every one with a force and a     modesty that touched us more than all his power   in another letter says the same ardent man “i begin to see that there may be a truer wisdom in the ‘humanitarianism’ of gladstone than in the purely political views of disraeli the sympathies of peoples with peoples the sense of a common humanity between nations the aspirations of nationalities after freedom and independence are real political forces and it is just because gladstone owns them as forces and disraeli disowns them that the one has been on the right side and the other on the wrong in parallel questions such as the upbuilding of germany or italy i think it will be so in this upbuilding of the sclave”344  it was my own good fortune to pass two days with him at this moment at high elms huxley and playfair were of the party mr gladstone had with him the printer’s proofs of his second pamphlet and was in full glow against turkish terrorism and its abettors this strong obsession could not be concealed nor was there any reason why it should be it made no difference in his ready courtesy and kindness of demeanour his willingness to enter into other people’s topics his pliant force and alacrity of mind on the sunday afternoon sir john lubbock our host took us all up to the hilltop whence in his quiet kentish village darwin was shaking the world the illustrious pair born in the same year had never met before mr gladstone as soon as seated took darwin’s interest in lessons of massacre for granted and launched forth his thunderbolts with unexhausted zest his great wise simple and truthloving listener then i think busy on digestive powers of the drosera in his greenhouse was intensely delighted when we broke up watching mr gladstone’s erect alert figure as he walked away darwin shading his eyes with his hand against the evening rays said to me in unaffected satisfaction “what an honour that such a great man should come to visit me” too absorbed in his own overwhelming conflict with the powers of evil mr gladstone makes no mention of his afternoon call and only says of the two days that “he found a notable party and made interesting conversation” and that he “could not help liking” one of the company then a stranger to him in his absence at church we were talking of the qualities that send men forward and keep them back “i should like to know” cried huxley “what would keep such a man as that back” pointing to where mr gladstone had been sitting “why put him in the middle of a moor with nothing in the world but his shirt and you could not prevent him from being anything he liked” and huxley was as far as possible from being a gladstonian    iv   m182 events meanwhile had moved the failure of the conference in december and the futility of an instrument known as the london protocol devised in march led up to a declaration of war by russia against turkey in april we now come to an episode in this controversy that excited lively passions at the moment and subjected mr gladstone’s relation to his party to a strain that would have been profoundly painful if his heroic intensity had not for the time taken him beyond the region of pain and pleasure       to lord granville 73 harley street april 23 1877—the     protocol the refusal of turkey the insistence of russia have     been followed tonight by the announcement that the russian chargé     has suspended relations with turkey is not the moment now come     for raising the rather stiff question whether a policy or a     substantive motion is to be submitted to parliament i hold back     from a conclusion as long as i can that i may benefit by the     views of others but it is perfectly plain that salisbury is at a     discount and that the government grow more turkish every day     reasonably plain that some grave arguments against moving have now     lost their force my own inclination is towards a series of     resolutions with such points as are rudely indicated on the     enclosed scrap please to let me have it again at some time i     have no copy      to the duke of argyll april 26 1877—i have drawn some     resolutions of which i intend to give notice today unless the     leaders will move if they will move though they may say much     less i can support them and express my fuller ideas in a speech     i cannot leave my bed but notice will be given in my name      from the diary april 27 1877—ill in the night kept my bed     saw dr clark twice saw mr goschen lord wolverton mr bright     lord frederick cavendish this day i took my decision a severe     one in face of my not having a single approver in the upper     official circle but had i in the first days of september asked     the same body whether i ought to write my pamphlet i believe the     unanimous answer would have been no arranged for the first     general notice to be given in my absence   the resolutions were five in number and the pith of them was first an expression of complaint against the porte second a declaration that in the absence of guarantees on behalf of the subject populations the porte had lost all claim to support moral or material third a desire that british influence should be employed on behalf of local liberty and selfgovernment in the disturbed provinces fourth this influence to be addressed to promoting the concert of the powers in exacting from the porte such changes as they might deem to be necessary for humanity and justice fifth an address to the crown accordingly on the expediency of these resolutions at a moment when a war with many complexities had just broken out opinion in the party was divided the official liberals and their special adherents doubted the radicals below the gangway headed by mr chamberlain and sir charles dilke supported the resolutions with enthusiasm adverse notices of the previous question were put upon the paper lord granville wrote to mr gladstone may 2 that his colleagues on the front opposition bench had met and were still of opinion “that it was not opportune at this moment to move resolutions and thought that the least antagonistic course as regarded you would be to vote for one of the motions announced for the previous question” to the duke of argyll mr gladstone wrote on the 4th—       our friends of the late cabinet have fallen into a sad series of     errors some of which i fear will be greatly resented in the     country to meet on wednesday to use the private pressure which     is being used as i am told against the resolutions and above     all to have announced the result of the meeting in the papers of     yesterday these form a combination in my opinion deplorable and     almost incredible i shall do all in my power to avert     consequences but my difficulties are greatly increased   it looked as if a mortal split within the party were inevitable       from the diary may 5—the post brought me near 140 letters     today which took some hours to examine but they are most     remarkable saw lord granville with lord wolverton they opened     the means of bridging over the chasm inadvertently made and i     readily went into the scheme it was carried through by granville     at a meeting of his friends after the academy dinner and he came     to me at wolverton’s with hartington to make known the result and     consider some details of execution what they ask of me is really     from my point of view little more than nominal they have in     truth been awakened as from a slumber by the extraordinary     demonstrations in the country 3—4½ attended the academy     exhibition 6½1014 at the dinner spoke for literature my     reception surprised me it was so good   m183 what was asked was that he should consent to an amended form of his second resolution declaring more simply and categorically that the turk by his misgovernment had lost his claims as to the other resolutions according to a common usage it was at his choice to accept a division on the first or first two and not divide upon the rest his speech of course would cover the ground of all the resolutions this reduction was as he truly said “little more than nominal” a friendly question was to be put when the time came and in reply he would state how things stood  the critical day arrived and not often has parliamentary excitement been so high it was a battle of high national and even european policy for england was now at the front it was a battle between two sections of a party it was the ordeal of a man admitted to be the greatest in the house and perhaps some of the onlookers felt much like the curious florentines as they wondered what would happen to savonarola and the monks in the great trial by fire       from the diary may 7—this day came in about 100 meetings and     say 200 letters or 250 worked hard upon the blue book and     references and notes for speech house at 414 for over two     hours i was assaulted from every quarter except the opposition     bench which was virtually silent such a sense of solitary     struggle i never remember at last i rose on the main question     nearly in despair as to the result but resolved at least not to     fail through want of effort i spoke 2½ hours voice lasting     well house gradually came round and at the last was more than     good it was over at 930 never did i feel weaker and more     wormlike dinner at sir w james’s and h of c again     10341234 8—i am the spoiled child of sleep this night was     an exception   the scene began with the question as preconcerted put by mr trevelyan such moves never fail to provoke some measure of mockery and this time both regular opponents and opponents in more or less disguise thought that they had got the monarch of the forest down the situation was one that opened the way for mr gladstone’s love of overprecision and his various explanations prolonged the wrangle it lasted until the dinnerhour “while many members” says one observer “were streaming out to dine and those who remained looked dejectedly at their watches mr gladstone who is sixtyeight years of age sprang again to his feet and without any sign of diminished spirit delivered a noble speech lasting two hours and a half it was perhaps the greatest triumph of irrepressible moral and physical vitality over depressing conditions that was ever won in the house of commons”345  the record of a distinguished eyewitness himself one day to be prime minister ought not to be omitted—       there was one of those preliminary parliamentary debates—or series     of debates—which preceded the main business of the evening in     this mr gladstone had to speak not once or twice but several     times and it was not until hour after hour had passed in this     preliminary skirmish in a house hostile impatient and utterly     wearied that he got up to present his case with that conviction     that he was right which was his great strength as a speaker in     and out of the house i never shall forget the impression that     speech left on my mind as a mere feat of physical endurance it     was almost unsurpassed as a feat of parliamentary courage     parliamentary skill parliamentary endurance and parliamentary     eloquence i believe it will always be unequalled346   as he drew to his close he looked according to mr forster “like an inspired man” and i have heard many hearers of cool temperament declare the passage about the montenegrins and onwards to have been the most thrilling deliverance that could ever be conceived here is this noble peroration—       sir there were other days when england was the hope of freedom     wherever in the world a high aspiration was entertained or a     noble blow was struck it was to england that the eyes of the     oppressed were always turned—to this favourite this darling home     of so much privilege and so much happiness where the people that     had built up a noble edifice for themselves would it was well     known be ready to do what in them lay to secure the benefit of     the same inestimable boon for others you talk to me of the     established tradition and policy in regard to turkey i appeal to     an established tradition older wider nobler far—a tradition not     which disregards british interests but which teaches you to seek     the promotion of these interests in obeying the dictates of honour     and justice and sir what is to be the end of this are we to     dress up the fantastic ideas some people entertain about this     policy and that policy in the garb of british interests and then     with a new and base idolatry fall down and worship them or are     we to look not at the sentiment but at the hard facts of the     case which lord derby told us fifteen years ago—viz that it is     the populations of those countries that will ultimately possess     them—that will ultimately determine their abiding condition it is     to this fact this law that we should look there is now before     the world a glorious prize a portion of those unhappy people are     still as yet making an effort to retrieve what they have lost so     long but have not ceased to love and to desire i speak of those     in bosnia and herzegovina another portion—a band of heroes such     as the world has rarely seen—stand on the rocks of montenegro and     are ready now as they have ever been during the 400 years of     their exile from their fertile plains to sweep down from their     fastnesses and meet the turks at any odds for the reestablishment     of justice and of peace in those countries another portion still     the 5000000 of bulgarians cowed and beaten down to the ground     hardly venturing to look upwards even to their father in heaven     have extended their hands to you they have sent you their     petition they have prayed for your help and protection they have     told you that they do not seek alliance with russia or with any     foreign power but that they seek to be delivered from an     intolerable burden of woe and shame that burden of woe and     shame—the greatest that exists on god’s earth—is one that we     thought united europe was about to remove but to removing which     for the present you seem to have no efficacious means of offering     even the smallest practical contribution but sir the removal of     that load of woe and shame is a great and noble prize it is a     prize well worth competing for it is not yet too late to try to     win it i believe there are men in the cabinet who would try to     win it if they were free to act on their own beliefs and     aspirations it is not yet too late i say to become competitors     for that prize but be assured that whether you mean to claim for     yourselves even a single leaf in that immortal chaplet of renown     which will be the reward of true labour in that cause or whether     you turn your backs upon that cause and upon your own duty i     believe for one that the knell of turkish tyranny in these     provinces has sounded so far as human eye can judge it is about     to be destroyed the destruction may not come in the way or by the     means that we should choose but come this boon from what hands it     may it will be a noble boon and as a noble boon will gladly be     accepted by christendom and the world    v   the division after a debate that lasted five days resulted in 354 for ministers against 223 for mr gladstone       of course if you had gone on alone lord granville told him you     would only have had either more or less than half the liberal     party if hartington had moved the first two resolutions the     government would certainly have had some 160 or 170 majority all     the malcontents behind the opposition front benches were obliged     to vote on monday in consequence of having so vigorously preached     allegiance during the previous ten days as it is the party voted     pretty well   m184 “the assumed laughter of the conservatives” he adds “showed their vexation and some of the radicals showed their cards—that it is not the eastern question but the hopes of breaking up the party that really excites them” the radicals on their part were extremely sore at the withdrawal of the resolutions “your goodness” wrote their leading man to mr gladstone the following day “has been abused in the interests of a section of the party who deserve least at your hands the current report in the lobbies last night spread by these gentlemen and easily believed by their friends was that you had ‘caved in’ ” could he not take some further opportunity of showing that he had not abandoned the policy of joint intervention and that the liberal party in the country had no reason to regret that they rose almost as one man to his call  at first it was thought that the discussion had done good by impressing the government with the desire of the country if not for coercion at least for real neutrality and that lord beaconsfield had submitted to the better influences in the cabinet it soon appeared that this had not happened “the fidelity of the party” said lord granville “and the large majority have given beaconsfield the lead of which he has not been slow to avail himself it is very serious” the war in the balkans went on the turks fought with valour and constancy sufferings on both sides were frightful in england the sympathy with the miserable victims of turkish misrule became modified by the reawakened jealousy of russian power mr gladstone held his ground with invincible tenacity against all comers he took his share in such parliamentary operations as were possible but these operations were necessarily fruitless and the platform now for the first time became the effective field for moving national opinion  great parties of tourists from the northern and midland towns began to make it a fashion to go on high pilgrimage to hawarden where besides a fine park they saw the most interesting man in the country and had a good chance of hearing an eloquent speech or watching a tree fall under the stroke of his vigorous arm if they brought him the tribute of a casket or an axe or some cunning walkingstick he was obliged to thank them and if he opened his lips to thank them the allengrossing theme was sure to well up some of these earnest utterances jarred even on his admirers in the press and out of it just so would critics in colleges and cathedral closes have found wesley and whitefield in their evangelising mission north south east and west excessive exaggerated indiscreet and deficient in good taste they could not understand how one supposed to be so knowing in all the manœuvres of parliament and party was at the same time so naïf this curious simplicity in fact marked him in all the movements into which he put his heart like every other grand missionary—the abolitionist the gospel missionary the free trader the peace man the temperance man—he could not believe that the truths arguments and appeals of which he was the bearer could fail to strike in all who heard them the same fire that blazed in bosoms fervid as his own  he went to birmingham and was received with tumultuous acclamations by many tens of thousands—       may 31—hawarden off before 11 reached birmingham at 314     a triumphal reception dinner at mr chamberlain’s meeting 7 to     9½ half occupied by my speech a most intelligent and duly     appreciative audience—but they were 25000 and the building i     think of no acoustic merits so that the strain was excessive a     supper followed june 1—breakfast party 930 much conversation     on the birmingham school board system off at 1045 to enfield     factory which consumed the forenoon in a most interesting survey     with colonel dickson and his assistants then to the fine qy     overfine board school where addresses were presented and i     spoke over half an hour on politics after luncheon to the town     hall address from the corporation made a municipal speech of say     20 minutes a good deal of movement in the streets with us even     today thence to the oratory and sat with dr newman347 saw     mr chamberlain’s very pleasing children then to the dinner     spoke again to hagley at 115   well was it said of this visit by dale that strenuous wholehearted man “forsaken or but feebly supported by many of those with whom he had shared many glorious conflicts and who owed to him their place and fame his courage remained undaunted and his enthusiasm for righteousness and freedom unquenched”  mr gladstone described the general situation in a letter to a correspondent out of england—       i cannot say much for the conduct of the powers that of the pope     and his court has been vile manning and most part of ireland have     followed suit france and germany are thinking of themselves and     one another and italy for fear of the pope is obliged to look     very much to germany austria is to some extent in a false     position for us there is no excuse there was no difficulty     whatever in our doing our duty i have said in parliament and i     deeply feel it is the most deplorable chapter of our foreign     policy since the peace of 1815 the good cause has been further     weakened by the bad conduct in varying degrees of many races     magyars and jews above all you see i cannot help filling up my     paper with this subject   in july he made a pleasure trip in one of sir donald currie’s steamers from london to dartmouth “we set out at 1020” he says “for the docks started in the dublin castle at noon we spent the night at the nore good weather kind reception splendid fare the cape deputies came with us as far as gravesend” among these deputies was mr kruger  in october he paid his first and only visit to ireland it lasted little more than three weeks and did not extend beyond a very decidedly english pale he stayed in great houses was feasted by the provost of trinity in spite of disestablishment and he had a friendly conversation with cardinal cullen in spite of vaticanism “you know mr gladstone” said the cardinal “we could have given you a warmer reception if it had not been for certain pamphlets which we in ireland did not like very well” he received the freedom of the city of dublin broke bread with the duke of marlborough at the viceregal lodge admired the picturesque site of the castle at kilkenny enjoyed sympathetic talks with host and hostess at abbeyleix and delighted in the curious antiquities and exquisite natural beauties of the county of wicklow of the multitudes of strange things distinctively irish he had little chance of seeing much     chapter v a tumultuous year 1878       on these great questions which cut so deep into heart and mind     the importance of taking what they think the best course for the     question will often seem even to those who have the most just     sense of party obligation a higher duty than that of party     allegiance—gladstone to granville 1878    i   of 1878 mr gladstone spoke as “a tumultuous year” in january after a fierce struggle of five months in the balkan passes the russian forces overcame the turkish defence and by the end of january had entered adrianople and reached the sea of marmora here at san stefano a treaty of peace was made at the beginning of march the last word of the eastern question as lord derby said in those days is this who is to have constantinople no great power would be willing to see it in the hands of any other great power no small power could hold it at all and as for joint occupation all such expedients were both dangerous and doubtful348 this last word now seemed to be writing itself in capital letters russia sent the treaty to the powers with the admission that portions of it affecting the general interests of europe could not be regarded as definitive without general concurrence a treaty between russian and turk within the zone of constantinople and almost in sight of st sophia opened a new and startling vista to english politicians powerful journalists supposed to be much in the confidence of ministers declared that if peace were ultimately concluded on anything like the terms proposed then beyond all doubt the outworks of our empire were gone and speedy ruin must begin about such a situation there had been but one opinion among our statesmen for many generations until mr gladstone “all men held that such a state of things as the russians at constantinople would bring the british empire face to face with ruin”349  m185 before the treaty of san stefano an angry panic broke out in parts of england none of the stated terms of british neutrality were violated either by the treaty or its preliminaries but even when no russian force was within forty miles of constantinople the cabinet asked for a vote of six millions january and a few days later the british fleet passed the dardanelles two years earlier mr gladstone had wished that the fleet should go to constantinople as a coercive demonstration against the porte now in 1878 the despatch of the fleet was a demonstration against russia who had done alone the work of emancipation that in mr gladstone’s view should have been done and might have been done without war by that concert of the powers from which england had drawn back the concert of the powers that our withdrawal had paralysed would have revived quickly enough if either austria or germany had believed that the czar really meant to seize constantinople “i have done my best” wrote mr gladstone to a friend “against the vote of six millions a foolish and mischievous proposition the liberal leaders have mistakenly as i think shrunk at the last moment from voting but my opinion is that the liberal party in general are firmly opposed to the vote as a silly misleading and mischievous measure” he both spoke and voted the opinion of his adherents was that his words notwithstanding his vote were calculated to do more to throw oil on the troubled waters than either the words or the abstention of the official leader  the appearance of the british fleet with the nominal object of protecting life and property at constantinople was immediately followed by the advance of russian troops thirty miles nearer to constantinople with the same laudable object the london cabinet only grew the wilder in its projects among them being a secret expedition of indian troops to seize cyprus and alexandretta with the idea that it would be fairer to the turk not to ask his leave two ministers resigned in succession rather than follow lord beaconsfield further in designs of this species350  “it is a bitter disappointment” mr gladstone wrote to madame novikoff “to find the conclusion of one war for which there was a weighty cause followed by the threat of another for which there is no adequate cause at all and which will be an act of utter wickedness—if it comes to pass which god forbid—on one side or on both that unhappy subject of the bit of bessarabia351 on which i have given you my mind with great freedom for otherwise what is the use of my writing at all threatens to be in part the pretext and in part the cause of enormous mischief and in my opinion to mar and taint at a particular point the immense glory which russia had acquired already complete in a military sense and waiting to be consummated in a moral sense too”  public men do not withstand war fevers without discomfort as bright had found in the streets of manchester when he condemned the crimean war one or two odious and unusual incidents now happened to mr gladstone—       feb 24—between four and six three parties of the populace     arrived here the first with cheers the two others hostile     windows were broken and much hooting the last detachment was only     kept away by mounted police in line across the street both ways     this is not very sabbatical there is strange work behind the     curtain if one could only get at it the instigators are those     really guilty no one can wonder at the tools   one sunday afternoon a little later march 4—       another gathering of people was held off by the police i walked     down with c and as a large crowd gathered though in the main     friendly we went into dr clark’s and then in a hansom off the     ground   stories were put about that lord beaconsfield reported the names of dissentient colleagues to the queen dining with sir robert phillimore jan 17 mr gladstone—       was emphatic and decided in his opinion that if the premier     mentioned to the queen any of his colleagues who had opposed him     in the cabinet he was guilty of great baseness and perfidy     gladstone said he had copies of 250 letters written by him to the     queen in none of which could a reference be found to the opinion     of his colleagues expressed in cabinet   on the same occasion by the way sir robert notes “gladstone was careful to restrain the expression of his private feelings about lord beaconsfield as he generally is”    ii   m186 in the summer the famous congress assembled at berlin june 13 to july 13 with lord beaconsfield and lord salisbury as the representatives of great britain to sanction reject or modify the treaty of san stefano before the congress met the country received a shock that made men stagger while in london it was impossible to attempt to hold a meeting in favour of peace and even in the northern towns such meetings were almost at the mercy of anybody who might choose to start a jingo chorus while the war party exulted in the thought that military preparations were going on apace and that the bear would soon be rent by the lion a document was one afternoon betrayed to the public from which the astounding fact appeared that england and russia had already entered into a secret agreement by which the treaty of san stefano was in substance to be ratified with the single essential exception that the southern portion of bulgaria was to be severed from the northern the treaty of berlin became in fact an extensive partition of the turkish empire and the virtual ratification of the policy of bag and baggage the schouvaloff memorandum was not the only surprise besides the secret agreement with russia the british government had made a secret convention with turkey by this convention england undertook to defend turkey against russian aggression in asia though concessions were made to russia that rendered asiatic turkey indefensible and turkey was to carry out reforms which all sensible men knew to be wholly beyond her power in payment for this bargain the sultan allowed england to occupy and administer cyprus  at the end of the session mr gladstone wound up his labours in parliament with an extraordinarily powerful survey of all these great transactions its range compass and grasp are only matched by the simplicity and lucidity of his penetrating examination it was on july 30—       finished the protocols and worked up the whole subject it loomed     very large and disturbed my sleep unusually h of c spoke 2½     hours i was in body much below par but put on the steam     perforce it ought to have been far better the speech exhausted     me a good deal as i was and am below par   he sketched in terse outline the results of the treaty—the independence of roumania servia and montenegro the virtual independence of northern bulgaria the creation in southern bulgaria under the name of eastern roumelia of local autonomy which must soon grow into something more bosnia and herzegovina though mr gladstone would have hoped for their freedom from external control had been handed over to austria but they were at any rate free from the ottoman the cardinal fact was that eleven millions of people formerly under turkish rule absolute or modified were entirely exempted from the yoke “taking the whole of the provisions of the treaty of berlin together i most thankfully and joyfully acknowledge that great results have been achieved in the diminution of human misery and towards the establishment of human happiness and prosperity in the east” a great work of emancipation had been achieved for the slavs of the turkish empire he deplored that equal regard had not been paid to the case of the hellenes in thessaly and epirus though even in 1862 palmerston and russell were in favour of procuring the cession of thessaly and epirus to greece as for the baffling of russian intrigue it was true that the bulgaria of berlin was reduced from the bulgaria of san stefano but this only furnished new incentives and new occasions for intrigue352 macedonia and armenia were left over  m187 on the conduct of the two british plenipotentiaries at berlin he spoke without undue heat but with a weight that impressed even adverse hearers—       i say sir that in this congress of the great powers the voice     of england has not been heard in unison with the institutions the     history and the character of england on every question that     arose and that became a subject of serious contest in the     congress or that could lead to any important practical result a     voice has been heard from lord beaconsfield and lord salisbury     which sounded in the tones of metternich and not in the tones of     mr canning or of lord palmerston or of lord russell i do not     mean that the british government ought to have gone to the     congress determined to insist upon the unqualified prevalence of     what i may call british ideas they were bound to act in     consonance with the general views of europe but within the limits     of fair differences of opinion which will always be found to     arise on such occasions i do affirm that it was their part to     take the side of liberty and i do also affirm that as a matter of     fact they took the side of servitude   the agreement with russia had in truth constantly tied their hands for instance lord beaconsfield and lord salisbury might make to russia as many eloquent speeches as they liked against the restoration of bessarabia but everybody in the room knew that the british government had taken the lead in virtually assuring russia that she had only to hold to her point and bessarabia should again be hers most effective of all was his exposure of the convention with turkey a proceeding by which we had undertaken behind the back of europe and against the treaty of paris to establish a sole protectorate in asiatic turkey353 we had made a contract of such impossible scope as to bind us to manage the reform of the judicature the police the finances the civil service of turkey and the stoppage of the sources of corruption at constantinople the load if we took it seriously was tremendous if we did not take it seriously then what was the whole story of the reform of asiatic turkey but a blind to excuse the acquisition of cyprus this great presentation of a broad and reasoned case contained a passage near its close that had in it the kernel of mr gladstone’s policy in the whole controversy that was now drawing to an end—       i think we have lost greatly by the conclusion of this convention     i think we have lost very greatly indeed the sympathy and respect     of the nations of europe i do not expect or believe that we shall     fall into that sort of contempt which follows upon weakness i     think it to be one of the most threadbare of all the weapons of     party warfare when we hear as we sometimes hear on the accession     of a new government that before its accession the government of     england had been despised all over the world and that now on the     contrary she has risen in the general estimation and holds her     proper place in the councils of nations this england of ours is     not so poor and so weak a thing as to depend upon the reputation     of this or that administration and the world knows pretty well of     what stuff she is made now i am desirous that the standard of     our material strength shall be highly and justly estimated by the     other nations of christendom but i believe it to be of still more     vital consequence that we should stand high in their estimation as     the lovers of truth of honour and of openness in all our     proceedings as those who know how to cast aside the motives of a     narrow selfishness and give scope to considerations of broad and     lofty principle i value our insular position but i dread the day     when we shall be reduced to a moral insularity the proceedings     have all along been associated with a profession as to certain     british interests which although i believe them to be perfectly     fictitious and imaginary have yet been pursued with as much zeal     and eagerness as if they had been the most vital realities in the     world this setting up of our own interests out of place in an     exaggerated form beyond their proper sphere and not merely the     setting up of such interests but the mode in which they have been     pursued has greatly diminished not as i have said the regard     for our material strength but the estimation of our moral     standard of action and consequently our moral position in the     world   m188 lord beaconsfield lost some of his composure when mr gladstone called the agreement between england and turkey an insane convention “i would put this issue” he said “to an intelligent english jury which do you believe most likely to enter into an insane convention a body of english gentlemen honoured by the favour of their sovereign and the confidence of their fellowsubjects managing your affairs for five years—i hope with prudence and not altogether without success—or a sophistical rhetorician inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity”354—and so forth in a strain of unusual commonness little befitting either disraeli’s genius or his dignity mr gladstone’s speech three days later was as free from all the excesses so violently described as any speech that was ever made at westminster  no speech however at this moment was able to reduce the general popularity of ministers and it was the common talk at the moment that if lord beaconsfield had only chosen to dissolve his majority would have been safe writing an article on “england’s mission” as soon as the house was up mr gladstone grappled energetically with some of the impressions on which this popularity was founded the pall mall gazette had set out these impressions with its usual vigour as mr gladstone’s reply traverses much of the ground on which we have been treading i may as well transcribe it—       the liberals according to that ably written newspaper have now     imbibed as a permanent sentiment a “distaste for national     greatness” this distaste is now grown into matter of principle     “the disgust at these principles of action ever grew in depth and     extent” so that in the danish the american and the     francogerman wars there was “an increasing portion of the nation     ready to engage in the struggle on almost any side” as a protest     against the position that it was bound not to engage in it at all     the climax of the whole matter was reached when the result of the     alabama treaty displayed to the world an england overreached     overruled and apologetic it certainly requires the astounding     suppositions and the gross ignorance of facts which the     journalist with much truth recites to explain the manner in which     for some time past pure rhodomontade has not only done the work of     reasoning but has been accepted as a cover for constant     miscarriage and defeat and doctrines of national selfinterest     and selfassertion as supreme laws have been set up which if     unhappily they harden into “permanent sentiment” and “matter of     principle” will destroy all the rising hopes of a true public law     for christendom and will substitute for it what is no better than     the communism of paris enlarged and exalted into a guide of     international relations it is perhaps unreasonable to expect that     minds in the condition of the “increasing portion” should on any     terms accept an appeal to history but for the sake of others     not yet so completely emancipated from the yoke of facts i simply     ask at what date it was that the liberal administrations of this     country adopted the “permanent sentiment” and the “matter of     principle” which have been their ruin not in 185960 when they     energetically supported the redemption and union of italy not in     1861 when on the occurrence of the trent affair they at a few     days’ notice despatched ten thousand men to halifax not when in     concert with europe they compelled the sultan to cut off the head     of his tyrannical pasha and to establish a government in the     lebanon not dependent for its vital breath on constantinople not     when in 1863 they invited france to join in an ultimatum to the     german powers and to defend denmark with us against the intrigues     which germany was carrying on under the plea of the duke of     augustenburg’s title to the duchies and when they were told by     louis napoleon in reply that that might be a great british     interest but that it had no significance for france not when in     1870 they formed in a few days their double treaty for the defence     of belgium does then the whole indictment rest on this—that in     conformity with the solemn declaration of the european powers at     paris in 1856 they cured a deepseated quarrel with america by     submitting to the risk of a very unjust award at geneva and     reconciled a sister nation and effected a real forward step in     the march of civilisation at about half the cost which the     present administration has recently incurred but without paying     it in agitating and disturbing europe or is it that during all     those years and many more years before them while liberty and     public law were supported and british honour vindicated     territorial cupidity was not inflamed by the deeds or words of     statesmen british interests were not set up as “the first and     great commandment” and it was thought better to consolidate a     still undeveloped empire which might well satisfy every ambition     as it assuredly taxes to the utmost every faculty    iii   m189 though this was a “tumultuous year” he noted with some complacency that the work of his pen produced a thousand pounds he laboured hard at his homeric primer “just contriving to squeeze the completion of it into the easter recess” wrote articles on the “peace to come” on the “paths of honour and of shame” on the abbé martin on “england’s mission” on “electoral statistics” the “friends and foes of russia” and other matters he finished a paper on iris “a charming little subject and for once i am a little pleased with my work” he toiled diligently at a collection of old articles which he christened gleanings—       november 14—worked on articles for reprint reperusal of     patteson moves me unto tears355 what a height he reached what     he did for god and the church praise to the highest in the     height 21—this morning the rain on the trees was wonderful and     lovely when it fell under the trees in the afternoon it was like     snow or small icicles an inch deep 25—read maud once more     and aided by doyle’s criticism wrote my note of apology and     partial retractation356 the fact is i am wanting in that higher     poetical sense which distinguishes the true artist   again and again he gives himself the delightful refreshment of arranging his books he finds that he has 700 volumes of english poetry “after 30 hours my library is now in a passable state and i enjoy in ruskin’s words ‘the complacency of possession and the pleasantness of order’ ” he sat to millais in the summer for what was to be the most popular of his portraits “july 5—went with c to examine the millais portrait surely a very fine work 6—sat once more to millais whose ardour and energy about his picture inspire a strong sympathy” on good friday he hears bach’s passion music “most beautiful yet not what i like for today” in the afternoon “we drove down to pembroke lodge for a few minutes saw lord russell at his desire—a noble wreck he recognised us and overflowed with feeling”  in december the argylls and mr ruskin came to hawarden—       dec 12—mr ruskin’s health better and no diminution of charm     14—mr ruskin at dinner developed his political opinions they     aim at the restoration of the judaic system and exhibit a mixture     of virtuous absolutism and christian socialism all in his     charming and modest manner   from a pleasing account of ruskin at hawarden privately printed we may take one passage—       something like a little amicable duel took place at one time     between ruskin and mr g when ruskin directly attacked his host     as a “leveller” “you see you think one man is as good as     another and all men equally competent to judge aright on political     questions whereas i am a believer in an aristocracy” and     straight came the answer from mr gladstone “oh dear no i am     nothing of the sort i am a firm believer in the aristocratic     principle—the rule of the best i am an outandout     inequalitarian” a confession which ruskin treated with intense     delight clapping his hands triumphantly   the true question against ruskin’s and carlyle’s school was how you are to get the rule of the best mr gladstone thought that freedom was the answer what path the others would have us tread neither ruskin nor his stormy teacher ever intelligibly told us    iv   writing on november 1 to madame novikoff mr gladstone said—       nov 1 ’78—my opinion is that this government is moving to its     doom and i hope the day of lord granville’s succession to it may     be within a twelvemonth it is not to be desired that this should     take place at once the people want a little more experience of     beaconsfield toryism   unfortunately this experience whatever be the precise name for it now came with disastrous promptitude and the nation having narrowly escaped one war found itself involved in two the peril of a conflict in europe had hardly passed before the country found itself committed to an attack for which the government themselves censured their highhanded agent upon the fiercest of the savage tribes of south africa a more formidable surprise was the announcement that by a headlong reversal of accepted indian policy war had been declared against the ameer of afghanistan     chapter vi midlothian 1879       μηδὲ μαλθακὸς γένῃ     τί δρᾴς ἀνίστω μή σε νικάτω κόπος      Æsch eum 74128      turn not faint of heart what doest thou let not weariness     overcome thee    i   m190 after the general election of 1874 mr gladstone resolved not again to offer himself as candidate for greenwich and in 1878 he formally declined an invitation from the liberals in that constituency at the end of the year it was intimated to him that he might have a safe seat in the city of edinburgh without a contest in january 1879 more ambitious counsels prevailed and it was resolved by the liberal committee of midlothian with lord rosebery in the front and amid infinite resolution enthusiasm and solid sense of responsibility that mr gladstone should be invited to contest the metropolitan county of scotland mr adam the scotch whip entered into the design lord wolverton approved and lord granville sent adam a letter assenting the sitting member was lord dalkeith eldest son of that duke of buccleuch who had been mr gladstone’s colleague in peel’s cabinet nearly forty years before and who had left it in the memorable december of 1845 parties had always been closely balanced although the tories had held their own pretty firmly and only two contests had been fought for forty years the midlothian tory was described to mr gladstone as of the hardest and narrowest type and the battle was therefore sure to be fierce some of the voters however told the canvassers that they would no longer support ministers “if the government continues much longer” they said “the whole nation will be in the poorhouse” the delight of the constituency was intense at the prospect of having for their champion one whom they described as the greatest living scotchman and adam january 10 1879 predicted a majority of two hundred mr gladstone rapidly but not without deliberation entered into the project “i am now only anxious” he wrote to mr adam january 11 “under your advice and wolverton’s about making the ground sure before the plunge is taken after it is taken you may depend on me” on the same day he wrote to lord granville—       i believe you have been cognizant of the proceedings about the     county of midlothian which are now beginning to bear a practical     aspect generally when one knows the tree is a large tree yet on     coming close up to the trunk it looks twice as large as it did     before so it is with this election if it goes on it will gather     into itself a great deal of force and heat and will be very     prominent thus far i am not sure whether i have put the matter     pointedly before you or have been content to assume your approval     of what i found adam pressing strongly upon me it will be a tooth     and nail affair   lord granville replied that he was doing a “very plucky and publicspirited thing” “your friends” he said “must begin working the coach at once but i should think you had better not appear too early in the field act louis xiv” “having received your approval” mr gladstone told lord granville “i wrote on the same day to adam accordingly” he then went into details with his usual care and circumspection when the public were made aware of what was on foot the general interest became hardly less lively all over the island than it was in the constituency itself it was observed at the time how impossible many people seemed to find it to treat anything done by mr gladstone as natural and reasonable nothing would appear to be a more simple and unobjectionable act than his compliance with the request of the electors of midlothian yet “he was attacked as if he were guilty of some monstrous piece of vanity and eccentricity”357 relentless opponents amused themselves by saying that “mr gladstone lives personally in wales and intends to live politically in scotland and his most fervently held opinions like the celtic population of the island have very much followed the same line of withdrawal”  mr gladstone described the general outlook in a letter to his son henry in india may 16—       the government declines but no one can say at what rate     elections are tolerably satisfactory to us—not i think more a     sure though evil instinct has guided them in choosing rather to     demoralise our finance than to pay their way by imposing taxes     but i do not see how they are long to escape this difficulty     our people look forward comfortably to the election the     government people say they will not have it this year but if we     come to the conclusion that we ought to have it i am by no means     sure but that though a minority we can force it by putting our     men into the field and making it too uncomfortable for them to     continue twelve or fifteen months in hot water i am safe in     midlothian unless they contrive a further and larger number of     faggot votes   adam looked forward with alarm to the mischief that might be done if the general election were to be protracted beyond the autumn of 1880 “in order to neutralise the present majority” he told mr gladstone “they will have to create faggots to a disgraceful extent but they are not troubled by scruples of conscience” the charity that thinketh no evil is perhaps less liberally given to party whips than even to other politicians  apart from midlothian mr adam in january 1879 said to mr gladstone that the liberals were helpless even in the best agricultural counties of england that he saw no hope of improvement they had neither candidates nor organisation in most of them and there was no means that he knew of and he had done all that he could to wake them up by november 1879 he reported that he had been carefully over the list taking a very moderate calculation of the chances at the coming election and he believed they ought to have a majority of 20 to 30 independent of home rulers mr gladstone wrote to lord granville—       aug 6 ’79—salisbury’s speech indicates and for several     reasons i should believe that they intend sailing on the quiet     tack having proved their spirit they will now show their     moderation in other words they want all the past proceedings to     be in the main “stale fish” at the elections except financial     shuffling they will very likely commit no new enormity before the     election in my view that means they will not supply any new     matter of such severe condemnation as what they have already     furnished therefore my idea is we should keep the old alive and     warm this is the meaning of my suggestion as to autumn work     rather than that i expect a dissolution it seems to me good     policy to join on the proceedings of 18769 by a continuous     process to the dissolution should this happen which i think     likely enough about march there will have been no opportunity     immediately before it of stirring the country i will not say our     defeat in 1874 was owing to the want of such an opportunity but     it was certainly i think much aggravated by that want    ii   m191 it was on november 24 that mr gladstone soon after eight in the morning quitted liverpool for edinburgh accompanied by his wife and miss gladstone “the journey from liverpool” he enters “was really more like a triumphal procession” nothing like it had ever been seen before in england statesmen had enjoyed great popular receptions before and there had been plenty of cheering and bellringing and torchlight in individual places before on this journey of a bleak winter day it seemed as if the whole countryside were up the stations where the train stopped were crowded thousands flocked from neighbouring towns and villages to main centres on the line of route and even at wayside spots hundreds assembled merely to catch a glimpse of the express as it dashed through at carlisle they presented addresses and the traveller made his first speech declaring that never before in the eleven elections in which he had taken part were the interests of the country so deeply at stake he spoke again with the same moral at hawick at galashiels he found a great multitude with an address and a gift of the cloth they manufactured with bare head in the raw air he listened to their address and made his speech he told them that he had come down expressly to raise effectually before the people of the country the question in what manner they wished to be governed it was not this measure or that it was a system of government to be upheld or overthrown when he reached edinburgh after nine hours of it the night had fallen upon the most picturesque street in all our island but its whole length was crowded as it has never been crowded before or since by a dense multitude transported with delight that their hero was at last among them lord rosebery who was to be his host quickly drove with him amidst tumults of enthusiasm all along the road to the hospitable shades of dalmeny “i have never” mr gladstone says in his diary “gone through a more extraordinary day”  all that followed in a week of meetings and speeches was to match people came from the hebrides to hear mr gladstone speak where there were six thousand seats the applications were forty or fifty thousand the weather was bitter and the hills were covered with snow but this made no difference in cavalcades processions and the rest of the outdoor demonstrations over what a space had democracy travelled and what a transition for its champion of the hour since the days half a century back when the christ church undergraduate the disciple of burke and canning had ridden in antireform processions been hustled by reform mobs and had prayed for the blessing of heaven on the house of lords for their honourable and manly decision in throwing out the bill yet the warmest opponent of popular government even the duke of buccleuch himself might have found some balm for this extraordinary display of popular feeling in the thought that it was a tribute to the most splendid political career of that generation splendid in gifts and splendid in service and that it was repaid moreover with none of the flattery associated with the name of demagogue mr gladstone’s counsels may have been wise or unwise but the only flattery in the midlothian speeches was the manly flattery contained in the fact that he took care to address all these multitudes of weavers farmers villagers artisans just as he would have addressed the house of commons—with the same breadth and accuracy of knowledge the same sincerity of interest the same scruple in right reasoning and the same appeal to the gravity and responsibility of public life an aristocratic minister speaking at edinburgh soon after estimated the number of words in mr gladstone’s midlothian speeches in 1879 at 85840 and declared that his verbosity had become “a positive danger to the commonwealth” tory critics solemnly declared that such performances were an innovation on the constitution and aggravated the evil tendencies of democracy358 talk of this kind did not really impose for an instant on any man or woman of common sense  m192 oratory ever since the days of socrates and perhaps long before has been suspected as one of the black arts and both at the time and afterwards mr gladstone’s speeches in his first midlothian campaign were disparaged as i have just said as sentiment rather than politics as sophistry not sound reason as illusory enchantment not solid and subsisting truth we are challenged to show passages destined to immortality with all admiration for the effulgent catalogue of british orators and not forgetting pitt on the slave trade or fox on the westminster scrutiny or sheridan on the begums of oude or plunket on the catholic question or grattan or canning or brougham we may perhaps ask whether all the passages that have arrived at this degree of fame and grandeur with the exception of burke may not be comprised in an extremely slender volume the statesman who makes or dominates a crisis who has to rouse and mould the mind of senate or nation has something else to think about than the production of literary masterpieces the great political speech which for that matter is a sort of drama is not made by passages for elegant extract or anthologies but by personality movement climax spectacle and the action of the time all these elements midlothian witnessed to perfection  it was my fortune to be present at one whole day of these performances “an overpowering day” mr gladstone calls it in his diary december 5 1879 “after a breakfastparty” he says “i put my notes in order for the afternoon at twelve delivered the inaugural address as lord rector of the university” glasgow this discourse lasted an hour and a half and themes familiar but never outworn nor extinct were handled with vigour energy and onward flow that made them sound as good as novel and even where they did not instruct or did not edify the noble music pleased the great salient feature of the age was described as on its material side the constant discovery of the secrets of nature and the progressive subjugation of her forces to the purposes and will of man on the moral side if these conquests had done much for industry they had done more for capital if much for labour more for luxury they had variously and vastly multiplied the stimulants to gain the avenues of excitement the solicitations to pleasure the universities were in some sort to check all this the habits of mind formed by universities are founded in sobriety and tranquillity they help to settle the spirit of a man firmly upon the centre of gravity they tend to selfcommand selfgovernment and that genuine selfrespect which has in it nothing of mere selfworship for it is the reverence which each man ought to feel for the nature that god has given him and for the laws of that nature then came an appeal into which the speaker’s whole heart was thrown for the intellectual dignity of the christian ministry if argument failed to the great christian tradition he would set small value on the multitude of uninstructed numerical adhesions or upon the integrity of institutions and the unbroken continuity of rite “thought” he exclaimed—“thought is the citadel” there is a steeplechase philosophy in vogue—sometimes specialism making short cuts to the honours of universal knowledge sometimes by the strangest of solecisms the knowledge of external nature being thought to convey a supreme capacity for judging within the sphere of moral action and of moral needs the thing to do is to put scepticism on its trial and rigorously to crossexamine it allow none of its assumptions compel it to expound its formulæ do not let it move a step except with proof in its hand bring it front to front with history even demand that it shall show the positive elements with which it proposes to replace the mainstays it seems bent on withdrawing from the fabric of modern society the present assault far from being destined to final triumph is a sign of a mental movement unsteady though of extreme rapidity but destined perhaps to elevate and strengthen the religion that it sought to overthrow “in the meantime” he said in closing this branch of his address “i would recommend to you as guides in this controversy truth charity diligence and reverence which indeed may be called the four cardinal virtues of all controversies be they what they may” this was followed by an eversalutary reminder that man is the crown of the visible creation and that studies upon man—studies in the largest sense of humanity studies conversant with his nature his works his duties and his destinies—these are the highest of all studies as the human form is the groundwork of the highest training in art so those mental pursuits are the highest which have man considered at large for their object some excellent admonitions upon history and a simple moving benediction brought the oration to an end  blue caps as well as red cheered fervently at the close and some even of those who had no direct interest in the main topics and were not much or not at all refreshed by his treatment of them yet confessed themselves sorry when the stream of fascinating melody ceased to flow then followed luncheon in the university hall where the principal in proposing the lord rector’s health expressed the hope that he had not grudged the time given to the serene if dull seclusion of academic things “i only quarrel with your word dull” said mr gladstone in reply “let me assure you gentlemen nothing is so dull as political agitation” by this time it was four o’clock before six he was at st andrew’s hall confronting an audience of some six thousand persons as eager to hear as he was eager to speak and not many minutes had elapsed before they were as much aflame as he with the enormities of the angloturkish convention the spurious harbour in cyprus the wrongful laws about the press in india the heavy and unjust charges thrown upon the peoples of india the baseless quarrel picked with shere ali in afghanistan the record of ten thousand zulus slain for no other offence than their attempt to defend against our artillery with their naked bodies their hearths and homes  once mentioning a wellknown member of parliament who always showed fine mettle on the platform mr gladstone said of him in a homely image that he never saw a man who could so quickly make the kettle boil this was certainly his own art here for an hour and a half thus he held them with the irresistible spell of what is in truth the groundwork of every political orator’s strongest appeal—from athenians down to girondins from pericles to webster from cicero to gambetta—appeal to public law and civil right and the conscience of a free and highminded people this highwrought achievement over he was carried off to dine and that same night he wound up what a man of seventy hardspent years might well call “an overpowering day” by one more address to an immense audience assembled by the glasgow corporation in the city hall to whom he expressed his satisfaction at the proof given by his reception in glasgow that day that her citizens had seen no reason to repent the kindness which had conferred the freedom of their city upon him fourteen years before  m193 the audience in st andrew’s hall at glasgow was we may presume like his audiences elsewhere and the sources of his overwhelming power were not hard to analyse if one were in analytic humour for one thing the speeches were rallying battlecries not sermons and everybody knew the great invisible antagonist with whom the orator before them was with all his might contending it was a gleaming array of the political facts of a political indictment not an aerial fabric of moral abstractions nor again had the fashion in which mr gladstone seized opinion and feeling and personal allegiance in scotland anything in common with the violent if splendid improvisations that made o’connell the idol and the master of passionate ireland one of the most telling speeches of them all was the exposure of the government finance in the edinburgh cornexchange where for an hour and a half or more he held to his figures of surplus and deficit of the yield of bushels to the acre in good seasons and bad of the burden of the incometax of the comparative burden per head of new financial systems and old with all the rigour of an expert accountant he enveloped the whole with a playful irony such as a goodhumoured master uses to the work of clumsy apprentices but of the paraphernalia of rhetoric there is not a period nor a sentence nor a phrase fire is suppressed so far from being saturated with colour the hue is almost drab yet his audience were interested and delighted and not for a moment did he lose hold—not even as one observer puts it “in the midst of his most formidable statistics nor at any point in the labyrinthine evolution of his longest sentences”  let the conclusion be good or let it be bad all was in groundwork and in essence strictly on the plane and in the tongue of statesmanship and conformable to don pedro’s rule “what need the bridge much broader than the flood”359 it was demosthenes not isocrates it was the orator of concrete detail of inductive instances of energetic and immediate object the orator confidently and by sure touch startling into watchfulness the whole spirit of civil duty in a man elastic and supple pressing fact and figure with a fervid insistence that was known from his career and character to be neither forced nor feigned but to be himself in a word it was a man—a man impressing himself upon the kindled throngs by the breadth of his survey of great affairs of life and nations by the depth of his vision by the power of his stroke physical resources had much to do with the effect his overflowing vivacity the fine voice and flashing eye and a whole frame in free ceaseless natural and spontaneous motion so he bore his hearers through long chains of strenuous periods calling up by the marvellous transformations of his mien a strange succession of images—as as if he were now a keen hunter now some eager bird of prey now a charioteer of fiery steeds kept well in hand and now and again we seemed to hear the pity or dark wrath of a prophet with the mighty rushing wind and the fire running along the ground  all this was mr gladstone in midlothian to think of the campaign without the scene is as who should read a play by candlelight among the ghosts of an empty theatre when the climax came it was found that mr gladstone’s tremendous projectiles had pounded the ministerial citadel to the ground and that he had a nation at his back what had been vague misgiving about lord beaconsfield grew into sharp certainty shadows of doubt upon policy at constantinople or cabul or the cape became substantive condemnation uneasiness as to the national finances turned to active resentment and above all the people of this realm who are a people with rather more than their share of conscience at bottom were led to consider whether when all is said there is not still a difference between right and wrong even in the relations of states and the problems of empire it was this last trait that made the atmosphere in which both speaker and his hearers drew their inspiration it may be true if we will that as a great critic sardonically hints “eloquence without being precisely a defect is one of the worst dangers that can beset a man”360 yet after all to disparage eloquence is to depreciate mankind and when men say that mr gladstone and midlothian were no better than a resplendent mistake they forget how many objects of our reverence stand condemned by implication in their verdict they have not thought out how many of the faiths and principles that have been the brightest lamps in the track of human advance they are extinguishing by the same unkind and freezing breath one should take care lest in quenching the spirit of midlothian we leave sovereign mastery of the world to machiavelli  i need not here go through the long list of topics as an attack upon ministers mr gladstone made out the upshot to be finance in confusion legislation in arrear honour compromised by breach of public law russia aggrandized and yet estranged turkey befriended as they say but sinking every year europe restless and disturbed in africa the memory of enormous bloodshed in zululand and the invasion of a free people in the transvaal afghanistan broken india thrown back he disclaimed all fellowship with those who believe that the present state of society permits us to make any vow of universal peace and of renouncing in all cases the policy of war he enumerated the six principles that he thought to be the right principles for us to foster the strength of the empire by just laws and by economy to seek to preserve the world’s peace to strive to the uttermost to cultivate and maintain the principle of concert in europe to avoid needless and entangling engagements to see that our foreign policy shall be inspired by such love of freedom as had marked canning palmerston russell to acknowledge the equal right of all nations he denounced “the policy of denying to others the rights that we claim ourselves” as untrue arrogant and dangerous the revival of the analogy of imperial rome for the guidance of british policy he held up as fundamentally unsound and practically ruinous for have not modern times established a sisterhood of nations equal independent each of them built up under the legitimate defence which public law affords to every nation living within its own borders and seeking to perform its own affairs he insisted that we should ever “remember the rights of the savage as we call him” “remember” he exclaimed “that the sanctity of life in the hill villages of afghanistan among the winter snows is as inviolable in the eye of almighty god as can be your own remember that he who has united you as human beings in the same flesh and blood has bound you by the law of mutual love that that mutual love is not limited by the shores of this island is not limited by the boundaries of christian civilisation that it passes over the whole surface of the earth and embraces the meanest along with the greatest in its unmeasured scope”  it was this free movement and pure air that gave to the campaign its marking character the campaign had a soul in it men were recalled to moral forces that they had forgotten in his last speech at edinburgh mr gladstone’s closing words were these—       i am sustained and encouraged and i may almost say driven on in     public life by the sentiment believed and entertained by me most     sincerely whether erroneously or not that the principles at     issue are much broader than those of ordinary contention i     humbly ask for confidence when i state my own belief that the     objects we have in view at the present time are objects connected     with the welfare of mankind upon the widest scale whatever we     may say amidst the clash of arms and amidst the din of preparation     for warfare in time of peace—amidst all this yet there is going on     a profound mysterious movement that whether we will or not is     bringing the nations of the civilised world as well as the     uncivilised morally as well as physically nearer to one another     and making them more and more responsible before god for one     another’s welfare i do most heartily thank you for having     given me the credit of being actuated by the desire to consider in     public transactions the wider interests of mankind and i venture     to assure you that so far as my objects and intentions are     concerned objects of that nature and nothing meaner or narrower     will ever be taken as the polestar of my life    iii   m194 two days after a departure from glasgow which he calls royal the unwearied warrior made his way through scenes of endless stir all along the journey back to his temple of peace at hawarden december 8 there he at once resumed his habits of daily industry revising proofs of speeches “reaching 255 pages” placing books and reading them—catullus hodgson’s turgot somebody on colour sense somebody else on indian finance jenkins on atheism bunbury’s geography—and so forth also “wrote on mythology and on economics together rather too much i am not very fit for composition after 5 pm” meanwhile christmas arrived and then the eve of his birthday with its reflections—reflections of one—       “who though thus endued as with a sense     and faculty for storm and turbulence     is yet a soul whose masterbias leans      where what he most doth value must be won”      december 28  and now i am writing in the last minutes of the     seventh decade of my life this closing is a great event the days     of our life are three score years and ten it is hardly possible     that i should complete another decade how much or how little of     this will god give me for the purposes dear to my heart ah what     need have i of what i may term spiritual leisure to be out of the     dust and heat and blast and strain before i pass into the unseen     world but perhaps this is a form of selflove for the last three     and a half years i have been passing through a political     experience which is i believe without example in our     parliamentary history i profess to believe it has been an     occasion when the battle to be fought was a battle of justice     humanity freedom law all in their first elements from the very     root and all on a gigantic scale the word spoken was a word for     millions and for millions who for themselves cannot speak if i     really believe this then i should regard my having been morally     forced into this work as a great and high election of god and     certainly i cannot but believe that he has given me special gifts     of strength on the late occasion especially in scotland three     things i would ask of god over and above all the bounty which     surrounds me this first that i may escape into retirement this     second that i may speedily be enabled to divest myself of     everything resembling wealth and the third—if i may—that when god     calls me he may call me speedily to die in church appears to be a     great euthanasia but not at a time to disturb worshippers such     are some of an old man’s thoughts in whom there is still     something that consents not to be old   among the other books that he had been reading was the biography of one of the closest of his friends and in the last hours of this annus mirabilis he writes—       read the life of bishop wilberforce it is indeed an edifying     book i knew him admired him loved him living but the laying     out of his full character from early days onwards tells me much i     did not know and lifts upwards my conception of him both in     greatness and in goodness     chapter vii the eve of the battle 1879       perhaps no man has ever had a mighty influence over his fellows     without having the innate need to dominate and this need usually     becomes the more imperious in proportion as the complications of     life make self inseparable from a purpose which is not     selfish—george eliot    i   it is interesting to get what light we may on mr gladstone’s frame of mind between his first astounding triumph in midlothian and the crowning mercy of the general election in october he had written to his son henry in india as to the probable date of the dissolution that the government had in his opinion “to choose between a minor or a less smashing defeat now or probably a more smashing one after the disclosure and real presentation of their most discreditable finance which can hardly be delayed beyond the spring” they had a chance of better trade but the likelihood also of worse revenue the great reason against dissolution was that they were in possession and every day’s delay was another day’s exercise of power he then proceeds to mention his personal position—       they are beginning to ask who is to succeed if beaconsfield is     displaced voices are coming up here and there some of them very     confident that the people will call for me nothing however but     a very general a nearly unanimous call from the liberals with     the appearance of a sort of national will could bring this demand     to a form in which it could or ought to be obeyed the reasons     against my coming forward are of immense force those against my     indicating any shadow of desire or willingness to come forward are     conclusive nor do i at present see any indication of a state of     things which would bring it about   m195 before leaving dalmeny at the end of his campaign mr gladstone wrote a letter to mr bright a copy of which along with the reply and two letters from lord wolverton he left tied up in a separate packet       to mr bright      nov 28 1879—you will probably recollect that during your last     visit to hawarden you suggested to me in a walk the expectation or     the possibility that when the return of liberals to power seemed     probable there might be a popular call for my resuming the     leadership of the party and that i stated to you what i believed     and you i think admitted to be the reasons against it these if     i remember right were four and i attached to them differing     degrees of weight      the first was that my health and strength would be unequal to the     strain at my time of life      the second that the work to be done was so formidable that hardly     any amount of courage availed to look it in the face      the third weightier than these was that a liberal government     under me would be the object from the first of an amount and kind     of hostility such as materially to prejudice its acts and weaken     or in given circumstances neutralise its power for good      the fourth that i was absolutely precluded under present     circumstances being bound by the clearest considerations of     honour and duty to render a loyal allegiance to granville as     leader of the party and to hartington as leader in the commons     and was entirely disabled from so much as entertaining any     proposition that could directly or indirectly tend to their     displacement      there is a fifth consideration that now presses me of which the     grounds had hardly emerged in regard to myself personally at the     time when we conversed together nothing could be so painful i     may almost say so odious to me as to force myself or to be     forced upon the queen under circumstances where the choice of     another from the ranks of the same party would save her from being     placed in a difficulty of that peculiar kind this it may be     said belongs to the same category as my first and second     objections but there it is      the enthusiasm of scotland is something wonderful as to the     county of midlothian i doubt whether the wellinformed tories     themselves in the least expect to win we go to taymouth on     monday i hope you are well and hearty and see cause to be     contented with the progress of opinion the more i think about the     matter the more strange and mysterious does it seem to me that     any party in this free nation should be found to sanction and     uphold policy and proceedings like those of the last two years in     particular i have written this because i am desirous you should     have clearly before you the matter of my conversation with you     and the means of verifying it      mr bright to mr gladstone      rochdale dec 12 1879—perhaps i ought to have written to you     sooner to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ult     but i preferred to let you get home before i wrote and i was in     truth rather puzzled as to what i ought to say      you with sufficient accuracy describe the purport of your     remarks during our conversation when i was with you a year ago i     saw the difficulty then in the future now perhaps near upon us     but it is one in which nothing can be done and “a masterly     inactivity” seems the only wise course if a breakup of the     present concern comes the queen will be advised to send for     granville or hartington the one sent for will accept and attempt     to form a government or he may have grave doubts and say that     you are the only man etc he will consult the other and will     consult you meantime there may be a “pronouncement” on the part     of the people through the press and public meetings which will     have a sudden effect on negotiations and on the views of the     queen and may decide the question if such a time should come     then you will have to say what is possible and i hope you will be     able to decide rightly and with reference solely to the interests     of the country and the service you owe to the crown as     representing the nation you will act with a most strict honour to     granville and hartington as i believe they will act to you if     as i hope for and believe no selfish ambition will come in to     make mischief the question will be determined in such a manner as     to content all honest men and what is best for all will be done     i am often asked as to the future i reply only so as to say     nothing to add to the evident difficulty of the situation      your scotch expedition has been one of discovery and of conquest     the tory press and partizans are evidently astonished at it the     government speakers have no new defence and they want the past to     be forgotten mr smith first lord i see entirely rejoices in     what has been done in south africa though “a few lives” have been     lost by it this official life seems sorely to demoralise some     homely and decent people i am fairly well so far during the     winter but i seem feeble when i compare myself with your activity     and power we are to have meetings in birmingham during     january i should prefer the quiet of obscurity to these meetings     i hope mrs gladstone and your daughter have enjoyed their scotch     trip and are well after it   five days later came lord wolverton’s report of the state of feeling on these delicate topics in high places in london he had seen lord granville on the evening of the 16th—       to most affectionate inquiries as to your health and powers i     gave a most satisfactory account and the conversation then went     to the question as to the effect which your recent triumphant     progress in midlothian and the north had produced upon your mind     i frankly said that you had in my opinion not anticipated such a     marked expression of public feeling and that it had doubtless     tended to lead your mind to the consideration of the position of     the party and to the fact that public opinion might call upon you     to an extent which no one could have looked for i then with     anxiety to convey what i know to be your desire most earnestly     impressed upon lord granville that you had upon every occasion     when the subject was alluded to prefaced all you had to say with     the strongest expressions of loyalty to hartington and himself     that i felt convinced that nothing would induce you to encourage     or to even listen to any attempt which others might make to     disturb the existing state of things as to the leadership unless     the wish was very clearly expressed to you by hartington and     himself and you would demand full proof that their interests and     that of the party strongly pointed to the reconsideration of your     own position i need hardly say that though i felt it my duty to     take care that i did not understate your feelings it was not     necessary to reassure granville upon that point      the conversation then went to the state of the party and its     present position i learnt that a private meeting had been held at     devonshire house in the morning i believe hartington granville     cardwell adam and harcourt were present my impression is that     the advice adam gave as to the elections was that “union in the     party at this moment would not be promoted by a change of front”     i do not mean to say that the question of leadership was actually     discussed but i suspect the conversation turned somewhat upon     the point which you place “third” in your letter to bright to     sum it all up i do not think you will at present be troubled by     any application to you from granville and hartington361   the third point in the letter to mr bright was the question whether a liberal government under mr gladstone would not be exposed to a special degree of hostility due to the peculiar antagonism that his personality excited in a later letter december 20 wolverton tells mr gladstone that in the conversation of the 16th “lord granville raised the point you made your third in your note to bright and that he did converse upon at some length evidently having real fears that many of our weakkneed ones would feel some alarm if hartington went from the front now and that the tories would intensify this to the uttermost i think this was all” another sentence indicates lord wolverton’s own view—       lord granville is not sanguine as to the future as you know he     is always inclined to “temporise” this is his line now and he is     perhaps right you know my fear was that without your name in     front the battle at the election would be fought at a great     disadvantage but i see the immense difficulty of a change of     front now even if they desired it and you consented to it this     you also feel i know   to all this mr gladstone replied to wolverton as follows—       hawarden december 18 1879—i thank you much for your letter     what you report yourself to have said is quite satisfactory to me     if granville said more than you had mentioned anything that fell     from him would be acceptable to me when i saw your envelope i     felt a dread lest the contents should be more substantive a     relief came on reading them but these communications are useful     as they give distinctness to ideas and through ideas to     intentions i may state mine as follows 1 my ears are shut     against all the world except it were granville and hartington 2     and even to them unless they spoke together and in clear and     decisive language 3 they are the judges whether to speak as     well as when to speak but as an individual i am of opinion that     there is not a case for their speaking now 4 were they to     speak now and as i have defined above i should then say let us     have nothing more than a formula and let the substance of it be     that by the nature of things no man in my position could make     beforehand an absolute renunciation and that the leadership in     the next parliament must like everything else be considered in     connection with what may appear at the dissolution to be the sense     of the country but that my action individually has been and will     continue to be that of a follower of lord granville and lord     hartington one thing i would ask of you as a fast friend if you     think that in anything i fall short by omission or commission of     perfect loyalty as a member of the party i beg you to tell me    ii   as usual with him these grave political preoccupations were not engrossing but only a part of the day’s task he carried on a pretty profuse correspondence he worked hard on his favourite diversion of arranging books and papers he gave much thought and time to estate matters with his eldest son with him too he felled now a chestnut now a sycamore he corrected the proofs of his speeches and wrote an article for mr knowles he read books and articles about eleusis and the hebrew migration from egypt and the olympian system and newman on the eirenicon and westcott on st john and somebody else upon st thomas aquinas for two or three days he was partially disabled by “a low faceache the reaction after heavy pressure under which i received from the mercy of god such remarkable support” in the middle of january alarming accounts came from his sister helen who lay dying at cologne thither he sped with his eldest brother and his sisterinlaw they found life fast ebbing and four days after their arrival the end came in the midst of pious exercises and affectionate care they were satisfied that she had been “freely restored to the unity of spirit and the bond of peace” and had died not in the actual roman communion a few days after his return home he records “wrote a long memorandum of the evidence in regard to dear helen’s religious profession” the remains they bore to fasque and by the end of the month he was again at hawarden once more at work with his eldest son upon the “accumulated disorder” and the rest of the round of his familiar employments among other things he read cowper’s task—“the fifth book very noble in its moral strain” and another entry will interest many—“feb 15—read the biography of noble dora pattison how by reflex action it stings yet even to her like bishop butler death was terrible” “he was haunted” he writes “with recollections of sister dora” then after a sunday passed in church exercises and “skimming many theological books” on february 23 he “left hawarden with a heavy heart”  he quickly found himself in the london whirlpool attending conclaves of his political friends dining out seeing irving in the merchant of venice “his best i think” speaking once or twice in the house and twice at london meetings in st pancras and marylebone where the popular enthusiasm made even his most hardened critics begin to suspect that the tide had really turned since the days when the londoners mobbed him in the street and broke his windows     chapter viii the fall of lord beaconsfield 1880       in causa facili cuivis licet esse disertum       et minimae vires frangere quassa valent     subruere est arces et stantia moenia virtus      —ov trist iii xi 21      in an easy case any man can plead and against shattered walls the     puniest strength prevails ’tis the overthrow of standing towers     and frowning ramparts that tests manhood    i   at last one day march 8 when mr gladstone was “writing a little on homer” he heard the fated news that the dissolution was announced lord beaconsfield published the famous letter to the lord lieutenant of ireland and in deep accents and sonorous sentences endeavoured to make home rule the issue of the election shrewd politicians with time to reflect found it not easy to divine why the government had chosen the particular moment it might be as some supposed that they thought the opposition had lately got into bad odour with the country by coquetting with home rulers as shown by the elections at liverpool and southwark but in fact little importance was to be attached to these two defeats of the opposition for liverpool had always been conservative and southwark was thoroughly disorganised by liberal divisions “the general opinion seems to be” says speaker brand mar 15 “that the opposition may gain slightly at the general election but not to an extent to break down altogether the conservative majority”  in what was in effect his election address lord beaconsfield warned the country that a danger in its ultimate results scarcely less disastrous than pestilence and famine distracted ireland a portion of its population was endeavouring to sever the constitutional tie that united it to great britain in that bond which was favourable to the power and prosperity of both “it is to be hoped” he went on “that all men of light and leading will resist this destructive doctrine the strength of this action depends on the unity of feeling which should pervade the united kingdom and its widespread dependencies the first duty of an english minister should be to consolidate that cooperation which renders irresistible the community educated as our own in an equal love of liberty and law and yet there are some who challenge the expediency of the imperial character of this realm having attempted and failed to enfeeble our colonies by their policy of decomposition they may perhaps now recognise in the disintegration of the united kingdom a mode which will not only accomplish but precipitate their purpose rarely in this century has there been an occasion more critical the power of england and the peace of europe will largely depend upon the verdict of the country peace rests on the presence not to say the ascendency of england in the councils of europe even at this moment the doubt supposed to be inseparable from popular elections if it does not diminish certainly arrests her influence and is a main reason for not delaying an appeal to the national voice”  to this manifesto mr gladstone with his usual long pains in the drafting of such pieces prepared his counterblast he went with direct force to what lord beaconsfield had striven to make the centre of his appeal—       in the electioneering address which the prime minister has issued     an attempt is made to work upon your fears by dark allusions to     the repeal of the union and the abandonment of the colonies     gentlemen those who endangered the union with ireland were the     party that maintained there an alien church an unjust land law     and franchises inferior to our own and the true supporters of the     union are those who firmly uphold the supreme authority of     parliament but exercise that authority to bind the three nations     by the indissoluble tie of liberal and equal laws as to the     colonies liberal administrations set free their trade with all     the world gave them popular and responsible government undertook     to defend canada with the whole strength of the empire and     organised the great scheme for uniting the several settlements of     british north america into one dominion to which when we quitted     office in 1866 it only remained for our successors to ask the     ready assent of parliament it is by these measures that the     colonies have been bound in affection to the empire and the     authors of them can afford to smile at baseless insinuations     gentlemen the true purpose of these terrifying insinuations is to     hide from view the acts of the ministry and their effect upon the     character and condition of the country   to those ministerial misdeeds he proceeded to draw the attention of the electors though he declared with threescore years and ten upon his head how irksome he felt the task “at home” he said “the ministers have neglected legislation aggravated the public distress by continual shocks to confidence which is the life of enterprise augmented the public expenditure and taxation for purposes not merely unnecessary but mischievous and plunged the finances which were handed over to them in a state of singular prosperity into a series of deficits unexampled in modern times” after shooting this heavy bolt he looked abroad “abroad they have strained if they have not endangered the prerogative by gross misuse and have weakened the empire by needless wars unprofitable extensions and unwise engagements and have dishonoured it in the eyes of europe by filching the island of cyprus from the porte under a treaty clause distinctly concluded in violation of the treaty of paris which formed part of the international law of christendom” as to the domestic legislation of the future it was in the election address of the prime minister a perfect blank it was true that in default of reform in this kingdom the nation was promised the advantages of “presence not to say ascendency” in the councils of europe       there is indeed he said an ascendency in european councils to     which great britain might reasonably aspire by steadily     sustaining the character of a power no less just than strong     attached to liberty and law jealous of peace and therefore     opposed to intrigue and aggrandizement from whatever quarter they     may come jealous of honour and therefore averse to the     clandestine engagements which have marked our two latest years to     attain a moral and envied ascendency such as this is indeed a     noble object for any minister or any empire    ii   mr gladstone wrote to lord acton on march 14—       on tuesday i am to set out for midlothian and my last general     election my general elections have been 1832 1835 1837 1841     1847 1852 1857 1859 1865 1874 and now 1880—what a list i     believe that among the official men of this century i am now     beaten only by lord palmerston in the length of my career in the     house of commons a clear answer from the nation a clear answer     in the right sense and a decisive accession of the liberal party     to power without me this is what i hope and pray i think that     the experts and the party generally are pretty sanguine none     doubt that the government are to lose a few doubt whether they     will be weaker than liberals and home rulers very many whether     weaker than liberals alone all agree that scotland will do its     duty   on the morning of the 16th mr gladstone started hundreds of people grew to thousands long before his train left king’s cross and all the way to edinburgh he found the same vivid interest and acclamation on the east coast that had greeted him in november on the west at grantham the mayor and a crowd estimated by nimble statisticians at two thousand awaited him at the station at york the lord mayor and six thousand at newcastleontyne too many thousands to count the little addresses made at these stoppingplaces were described as a sort of table of contents of the more elaborate speeches to be delivered in midlothian itself as he crossed the tweed the fervour did not cool and when at last he reached edinburgh he encountered a scene almost as wonderful as that which had met him four months before  again he was the guest at dalmeny and again he renewed his prodigious exertions amid a vehemence of admiration and delight that became more intense as the days passed here is an entry or two from the diary—       travelled forty miles and delivered three speeches of fortyfive     or fifty minutes each at juniper green colinton and mid calder     enthusiasm unabated corrected and despatched proofs of     religion achaian and semitic mar 21 palm sunday—drove to     edinburgh cathedral service 111½ free st george’s in the     afternoon walked out seven miles with lord rosebery 22—to     edinburgh after working as usual on my papers at 115 short     complimentary address at liberal club then to george street and     on to the city election committee short speech then by train to     gilmerton spoke fortyfive or fifty minutes next after tea to     loanhead and after more tea spoke again for some time on russian     aggrandizement everywhere the greatest enthusiasm mr cowan     gave me interesting details about magyar and bohemian students     back to dalmeny at 720   and so day after day did panting time toil after him in vain many of us have known long spells of hard electioneering—but not in one’s seventyfirst year with every single word as it fell into print on the morrow watched with the lynx eyes of party scrutiny and all loaded with the heaviest personal responsibility  m196 on march 24 the parliament was dissolved on march 30 the first elections took place and the first pollings on the day following from the early returns it was pretty evident that the liberals would have a majority on the first day they made a net gain of fifteen seats in sixtynine constituencies by the end of the fourth day a total net gain of fifty seats was recorded the ministerial majority was already gone the county elections brought new surprises and by the end of the second week the liberal gains were reckoned at ninetynine  mr gladstone’s fortnight of discourse ended on the 2nd of april “so” he records “ends the second series of the speeches in which i have hammered with all my poor might at the fabric of the present tory power april 3—cut down a spanish chestnut in dalmeny park by order the day was quiet but my papers and letters and the incoming news made it busy it seemed as if the arm of the lord had bared itself for work that he has made his own 4—a lull in election news but the reflections on what has passed are overpowering” here are his closing words and they are not without historic import—       the great trial gentlemen proceeds you have great forces     arrayed against you i say “you” if you will permit me to     identify myself with you i will say we have great forces arrayed     against us and apparently we cannot make our appeal to the     aristocracy excepting that which must never be forgotten the     distinguished and enlightened minority of that body of able     energetic patriotic liberalminded men whose feelings are with     those of the people and who decorate and dignify their rank by     their strong sympathy with the entire community with that     exception in all the classes of which i speak i am sorry to say     we cannot reckon upon what is called the landed interest we     cannot reckon upon the clergy of the established church either in     england or in scotland subject again and always in each case to     the most noble exceptions—exceptions i trust likely to enlarge     and multiply from day to day on none of these can we place our     trust we cannot reckon on the wealth of the country nor upon the     rank of the country nor upon the influence which rank and wealth     usually bring in the main these powers are against us for     wherever there is a close corporation wherever there is a spirit     of organised monopoly wherever there is a narrow and sectional     interest apart from that of the country and desiring to be set up     above the interest of the public there gentlemen we the     liberal party have no friendship and no tolerance to expect     above all these and behind all these there is something greater     than these—there is the nation itself this great trial is now     proceeding before the nation the nation is a power hard to rouse     but when roused harder still and more hopeless to resist i     figure to myself those who have constituted the majority of the     late house of commons as the persons arraigned and the     constituencies of the country as those who are called together in     the solemn order of the constitution to hear the evidence and to     pronounce the verdict that evidence has been pretty largely     given that verdict we await we have none of the forms of a     judicial trial there are no peers in westminster hall there are     no judges on the woolsack but if we concentrate our minds upon     the truth of the case as apart from its mere exterior it is a     grander and a more august spectacle than was ever exhibited either     in westminster hall or in the house of lords for a nation called     to undertake a great and responsible duty—a duty which is to     tell as we are informed from high authority on the peace of     europe and on the destinies of england—has found its interests     mismanaged its honour tarnished and its strength burdened and     weakened by needless mischievous unauthorised and unprofitable     engagements and it has resolved that this state of things shall     cease and that right and justice shall be done362   m197 mr gladstone was already member for leeds so far back as the march of 1878 sir james kitson had written to ask him to become a candidate for the great city of the west siding but mr gladstone declined the proposal then a deputation came to him in harley street and he made them a speech on the eastern question but avoided any reference to the subject which they had come to handle the stout yorkshiremen were not to be baffled and mr gladstone nominated without action of his own was now returned by the unprecedented vote of 24622363 he was right in calling the leeds election “one of the most conspicuous and imposing victories ever won for the liberal cause”364 still public interest was concentrated upon midlothian and the might with which he prevailed over men’s minds there was admitted by his foes to be the most impressive tribute ever paid to political man and his vast powers as orator and popular leader in midlothian the crusade had been opened and in midlothian its triumph was sealed  the poll was declared in edinburgh soon after seven on the evening of april 5 and a few minutes later the result amid every demonstration of extravagant delight from the triumphant multitude as they rushed away from the courthouse was made known to mr gladstone at a house in george street taken by lord rosebery for the occasion a couple of candles were brought from the diningtable and held on each side of him so that his face might be seen as from the balcony he spoke a few words of thanks365 “drove into edinburgh about four” mr gladstone records “at 720 mr reid brought the figures of the poll—gladstone 1579 dalkeith 1368 quite satisfactory soon after 15000 people being gathered in george street i spoke very shortly from the windows and rosebery followed excellently well home about 10 wonderful and nothing less has been the disposing guiding hand of god in all this matter” the majority was not of great dimensions but it was adequate and sufficient and the victory was celebrated half through the night with bonfires illuminations fireworks and all the other fashions of signifying public joy throughout scotland and the north of england the astrologers meteorologists and prognosticators of pall mall and fleet street felt that this time at least they had not rightly plumbed the depths of the democratic seas  lord beaconsfield was staying alone at that time in the historic halls of hatfield their master being then abroad there hour by hour and day after day news of the long train of disasters reached him from one in confidential relations with him and who saw much of him at this moment i have heard that the fallen minister who had counted on a very different result now faced the ruin of his government the end of his career and the overwhelming triumph of his antagonist with an unclouded serenity and a greatness of mind worthy of a man who had known high fortunes and filled to the full the measure of his gifts and his ambitions    iii   m198 some writers complained that the language of midlothian was as solemn as if the verdict of the country were about to settle the issues of the battle of armageddon it was not exactly the battle of armageddon but the election of 1880 was at any rate one of the most remarkable in party history for one thing activity was unprecedented and mr gladstone’s fiery spirit seemed to have spread over the country a list prepared by the liberal whips and preserved by mr gladstone describes the new parliament as composed of 347 liberals 240 conservatives and 65 nationalists looking at the divisions of the three kingdoms we find england and wales contributing 282 liberals against 207 tories scotland 52 liberals against 8 tories and ireland 13 liberals against 25 tories the irish nationalists were of two shades 35 followers of mr parnell 26 moderate home rulers who followed mr shaw and 4 dubious in england and wales therefore the liberal majority was 75 and in scotland it was 44 turning to electoral aspects with special social significance we note that of the county constituencies 63 sent liberal members as against 124 tories in the metropolis as a whole the government gained one seat and lost four with the result that london was represented in the new parliament by 8 tories and 14 liberals one victory of real importance was won by the government for they beat the liberal by two to one in the city of london the heart and centre of many of those powerful influences that mr gladstone had described in his last speech in the midlothian election as determined foes from whom the liberal party had no tolerance to expect “the tory party” mr gladstone noted “has never had a majority on any one of its own four dissolutions—1852 1859 1868 1880”       mr gladstone to lord rosebery      hawarden april 10 1880— i should like to write about these     marvellous events but how can i the romance of politics which     befel my old age in scotland has spread over the whole land you     remember perhaps my series of fractions comparing daily the net     gains with the gross returns the first day began with 113 or     thereabouts it had got to 110 or 19 when we left you it is now     16 how idle to talk about the caprice of household suffrage the     counties have given quite as remarkable results as the boroughs i     was stunned at the end of the first night and i am still out of     breath from the endeavour to keep up with the rapidity of events     i suppose the conservative scotch will fill the first class     compartment or nearly so but no more wales i beg you to     observe has not as i think been behind scotland in her     achievements most of the wretched percentage of compensation on     “tory gains” on the general list is wretched in quality as well as     quantity and consists of the district places to scarcely one     of these gains can they point with any keen satisfaction as to     midlothian the moral effect before and after has i think     surpassed all our hopes the feeling until it was over since     which there has justly been a centring of thought on e     lancashire was so fastened on it that it was almost like one of     the occasions of old when the issue of battle was referred to     single combat the great merit of it i apprehend lay in the     original conception which i take to have been yours and to     overshadow even your operations towards the direct production of     the result but one thing it cannot overshadow in my mind the     sense of the inexpressible aid and comfort derived day by day from     your considerate everwatchful care and tact latin not to be     identified let me apply these same words calling on you for a     translation if needful to lady rosebery i should feel profoundly     ashamed of the burdens we brought you had i not seen how truly     they were borne in the spirit which alone makes all burdens     light it is a very pleasant subject of reflection to me that the     riveting effect of companionship in a struggle like this does not     pass away with the struggle itself but abides      our stratagem for a quiet exit was on the whole successful at     carlisle there was perfect quiet at most of the few places where     the train stopped there were a score or two of people and no more     at hawarden arriving between 9 and 10 am we cheated the     triumphal preparations but made amends by carrying them over to     herbert the following day we now become eager for the east     worcestershire election and are sanguine about my son’s return at     warrington we got over the three hours wonderfully and succeeded     in sleeping though not exactly μαλθακῶς κατακείμενος through a     succession of the most violent and unearthly noises banging     crashing roaring squealing that a railway station traversed by     innumerable goods’ trains can supply i will not trouble you     with more words of thanks i feel them so poor and idle   two days later mr gladstone wrote to the duke of argyll—       april 12 1880—all our heads are still in a whirl from the     great events of the last fortnight which have given joy i am     convinced to the large majority of the civilised world the     downfall of beaconsfieldism is like the vanishing of some vast     magnificent castle in an italian romance it is too big however     to be all taken in at once meantime while i inwardly rejoice i     am against all outward signs beyond such as are purely local of     exultation for they are not chivalrous and they would tend to     barbarise political warfare we may be well content to thank god     in silence but the outlook is tremendous the gradual unravelling     of the tangled knots of the foreign and indian policy will indeed     be a task for skilled and strong hands if they can be found and     these can hardly be found such as the case requires     chapter ix the second ministry 1880       there is indeed one great and critical act the responsibility for     which falls momentarily or provisionally on the sovereign it is     the dismissal of an existing ministry and the appointment of a     new one this act is usually performed with the aid drawn from     authentic manifestations of public opinion mostly such as are     obtained through the votes or conduct of the house of     commons—gladstone   the day after the declaration of the poll in midlothian mr gladstone and his wife and daughter quitted dalmeny and made their way homewards as we have just seen       april 6—a heavy day with post incessant telegrams and     preparations for departure we drove however to linlithgow saw     the beautiful church and fine old castle and i made a short     nonpolemical speech to the people careful concealment of the     plans of departure until well on in the evening left this most     hospitable of all houses at 830 and got into the 925 escaping     by secrecy all demonstration except from some 200 who seemed to     gather on the instant travelled all night and had time to     ruminate on the great hand of god so evidently displayed      april 7 wed—after three hours of successful sleep amid     frightful unearthly noises at warrington we went off to chester     and hawarden saluted enthusiastically but escaping all     crowds set to work at once on a mass of letters and papers     the day occupied with papers letters and telegrams and reading     my vatican tracts the triumph grows and grows to god be the     praise      april 9—letters passed 100 april 10 sat—church 8½ am     wrote to  postal arrivals 140 terrible wolverton arrived to     dinner and i spent the evening in full conversation with him he     threatens a request from granville and hartington again i am

journey but     people gathered at chester station and euston i vaguely feel that     this journey is a plunge out of an atmosphere of peace into an     element of disturbance may he who has of late so wonderfully     guided guide me still in the critical days about to come april     20—this blank day is i think probably due to the queen’s     hesitation or reluctance which the ministers have to find means     of covering   one joyous element in these days at hawarden was the arrival first of the youngest son of the house then of the eldest the latter of them having won a seat in worcestershire and the former having failed in middlesex after a display of qualities that delighted his family and friends much more than mere victory could have done “about one” mr gladstone marks on the 8th “herbert entered in triumph we were there and could not but be much moved” and on the 14th “willy made his triumphal entry at four and delivered a very good speech neville lyttelton too spoke well from the carriage” as lord acton wrote to miss gladstone about middlesex “the picture of the young untried son bursting into sudden popularity and turning men’s thoughts from the absorbing exploits of his father adds an affecting domestic feature to that great biography that meeting at hawarden after such a revolution and such a growth is a thing i cannot think of without emotion” a little later when mr gladstone’s option of midlothian left the leeds seat vacant his son was elected without opposition to fill it mr gladstone’s letters on this operation which had its delicacies are an excellent example of his habits of careful and attentive judgment in handling even secondary affairs     ii   m199 from the moment when it became clear that lord beaconsfield would be swept out of office it was just as clear to sensible men that only one successor was possible it was mr gladstone as everybody knew and said who had led and inspired the assault a cabinet without him would hold its councils without the most important of the influences on which it depended if the majorities that carried the election could have been consulted on the choice of a minister nobody doubted upon whom with unanimity their choice would fall even those who most detested the result even those who held that a load of anxiety would be lifted from the bosoms of many liberals of official rank if they were to hear of mr gladstone’s definite retirement from public life still pronounced that it was mr gladstone’s majority and that was what the contributors to that majority intended to vote for was above all else his return to office and his supremacy in national affairs if he would not lay down his power such persons said it was best for everybody that he should exercise it openly regularly and responsibly as head of the government367 the very fact that he had ceased to be the leader of the opposition five years before was turned into an argument for his responsibility now for it was his individual freedom that had enabled him to put forth all his strength without any of that management and reserve that would have been needed in one who was titular leader of a party as well as real leader of the nation the victory would have been shorn of half its glory if any other chief had been given to the party in short no minister not pitt in 1784 nor grey in 1831 nor peel ten years later nor palmerston in 1855 was ever summoned by more direct and personal acclaim whatever liberty of choice the theory of our constitution assigned to the queen in practice this choice did not now exist it was true that in the first of his midlothian speeches mr gladstone had used these words “i hope the verdict of the country will give to lord granville and lord hartington the responsible charge of its affairs”368 but events had wrought a surprise and transformed the situation  some indeed there were whom a vision of another kind possessed a vision of the moral grandeur that would attend his retirement after putting apollyon and his legions to flight and planting his own hosts in triumph in the full measure of their predominance some who loved him might still regretfully cherish for him this heroic dream retirement might indeed have silenced evil tongues it would have spared him the toils of many turbid and tempestuous years but public life is no idyll mr gladstone had put himself by exertions designed for public objects into a position from which retreat to private ease would have been neither unselfish nor honourable is it not an obvious test of true greatness in a statesman that he shall hold popularity credit ascendency and power such as mr gladstone now commanded as a treasure to be employed with regal profusion for the common good not guarded in a miser’s strongbox for this outlay of popularity the coming years were to provide mr gladstone with occasions only too ample  if retreat was impossible then all the rest was inevitable and it is easy to guess the course of his ruminations between his return from midlothian and his arrival in harley street mr gladstone himself looking back seventeen years after upon his refusal in 1880 to serve in a place below the first wrote “i conceive that i was plainly right in declining it for had i acted otherwise i should have placed the facts of the case in conflict with its rights and with the just expectations of the country besides as the head of a five years’ ministry and as still in full activity i should have been strangely placed as the subordinate of one twenty years my junior and comparatively little tested in public life”  as the diary records on monday april 12 lord wolverton left hawarden and was to see the two liberal leaders the same day he did so and reported briefly to his chief at night—       i hope the plimsoll matter369 is at an end the clubs tonight     think that lord beaconsfield will meet parliament and that when     the time comes if asked he will advise that hartington should be     sent for i do not believe either i have seen lord granville and     hartington both came here upon my arrival and adam with them     lord granville hopes you may be in london on friday i told him i     thought you would be he has gone to walmer and will come up on     friday he has a good deal to think of in the meantime as to “the     position of the party” i need not say more than this as it     embraces the whole question which he now quite appreciates     nothing could be more cordial and kind than granville and     hartington but i hardly think till today they quite realised     the position which i confess seems to me as clear as the sun at     noon they will neither of them speak to any one till friday when     lord granville hopes to see you adam is much pleased with your     kind note to him he has gone home till friday it is well to be     away just now for the gossip and questioning is unbearable   acknowledging this on the following day april 13 mr gladstone says to lord wolverton—       the claim so to speak of granville and hartington or rather i     should say of granville with hartington as against me or rather     as compared with me is complete my labours as an individual     cannot set me up as a pretender moreover if they should on     surveying their position see fit to apply to me there is only one     form and ground of application so far as i see which could be     seriously entertained by me namely their conviction that on the     ground of public policy all things considered it was best in the     actual position of affairs that i should come out it cannot be     made a matter of ceremonial as by gentlemen waiving a precedence     or a matter of feeling as by men of high and delicate honour     determined to throw their bias against themselves they have no     right to throw their bias against themselves—they have no right to     look at anything but public policy and this i am sure will be     their conviction nothing else can possibly absolve them from     their presumptive obligation as standing at the head of the party     which for the time represents the country   as a matter of fact i find no evidence that the two leaders ever did express a conviction that public policy required that he should stand forth as a pretender for the post of prime minister on the contrary when lord wolverton says that they “did not quite realise the position” on the 12th this can only mean that they hardly felt that conviction about the requirements of public policy which mr gladstone demanded as the foundation of his own decision     iii   the last meeting of the outgoing cabinet was held on april 21 what next took place has been described by mr gladstone himself in memoranda written during the days on which the events occurred       interview with lord hartington      april 22 1880 at 7 pm hartington came to see me at     wolverton’s house and reported on his journey to windsor      the queen stood with her back to the window—which used not to be     her custom on the whole i gathered that her manner was more or     less embarrassed but towards him not otherwise than gracious and     confiding she told him that she desired him to form an     administration and pressed upon him strongly his duty to assist     her as a responsible leader of the party now in a large majority     i could not find that she expressed clearly her reason for     appealing to him as a responsible leader of the party and yet     going past the leader of the party namely granville whom no     one except himself has a title to displace she however indicated     to him her confidence in his moderation the phrase under which he     is daily commended in the daily telegraph at this moment i     think beaconsfield’s personal organ and the recipient of his     inspirations by this moderation the queen intimated that     hartington was distinguished from granville as well as from me      hartington in reply to her majesty made becoming     acknowledgments and proceeded to say that he did not think a     government could be satisfactorily formed without me he had not     had any direct communication with me but he had reason to believe     that i would not take any office or post in the government except     that of first minister under those circumstances he advised her     majesty to place the matter in my hands the queen continued to     urge upon him the obligations arising out of his position and     desired him to ascertain whether he was right in his belief that i     would not act in a ministry unless as first minister this he     said is a question which i should not have put to you except     when desired by the queen      i said her majesty was quite justified i thought in requiring     positive information and he therefore in putting the question     to me of my action he was already in substantial possession as     it had been read to him he had told me by wolverton i am not     asked i said for reasons but only for aye or no and     consequently i have only to say that i adhere to my reply as you     have already conveyed it to the queen      in making such a reply it was my duty to add that in case a     government should be formed by him or by granville with him whom     the queen seemed to me wrongly to have passed by—it was to     granville that i had resigned my trust and he hartington was     subsequently elected by the party to the leadership in the house     of commons—my duty would be plain it would be to give them all     the support in my power both negatively as by absence or     noninterference and positively promises of this kind i said     stood on slippery ground and must always be understood with the     limits which might be prescribed by conviction i referred to the     extreme caution almost costiveness of peel’s replies to lord     russell when he was endeavouring to form a government in december     1845 for the purpose of carrying the repeal of the corn law in     this case however i felt a tolerable degree of confidence     because i was not aware of any substantive divergence of ideas     between us and i had observed with great satisfaction when his     address to northeast lancashire came into my hands after the     writing but before the publication of mine to midlothian that     they were in marked accordance as to opinions if not as to form     and tone and i did not alter a word in the case of the first     palmerston government i had certainly been thrown into rather     sharp opposition after i quitted it but this was mainly due to     finance i had not approved of the finance of sir george lewis     highly as i estimated his judgment in general politics and it was     in some ways a relief to me when we had become colleagues in the     second palmerston government to find that he did not approve of     mine however i could only make such a declaration as the nature     of the case allowed      he received all this without comment and said his conversation     with her majesty had ended as it began each party adhering to the     ground originally taken up he had not altered his advice but had     come under her majesty’s command to learn my intentions which he     was to make known to her majesty returning to windsor this day     at one      he asked me what i thought of the doctrine of obligation so much     pressed upon him by the queen i said that in my opinion the case     was clear enough her majesty had not always acted on the rule of     sending for the leader of the opposition palmerston was the known     and recognised leader of the opposition in 1859 but the queen     sent for granville the leader if sent for was in my opinion     bound either to serve himself or to point out some other course     to her majesty which he might deem to be more for the public     advantage and if that course should fail in consequence of the     refusal of the person pointed out the leader of the party could     not leave her majesty unprovided with a government but would be     bound in loyalty to undertake the task      i did not indicate nor did he ask what i should do if sent for     he did not indicate nor did i ask what he should do if the queen     continued to press him to go on in spite of his advice to her to     move in another direction—april 23 1880   a barren controversy was afterwards raised on the question whether at this exciting moment lord hartington tried to form a government what he did according to the memorandum was to advise the queen to send for mr gladstone on the ground of his belief that mr gladstone would join no government of which he was not the head the queen then urged him to make sure of this before she would acquiesce in his refusal to undertake the commission the queen as mr gladstone says had a right to require positive information and lord hartington had a right and it was even his duty to procure this information for her and to put the direct question to mr gladstone whether he would or would not act in an administration of which he was not the head he went back to windsor not in the position of a statesman who has tried to form a government and failed but in the position of one who had refused a task because he knew all along that failure was certain and now brought proof positive that his refusal was right370  what happened next was easy to foresee—       interview with lord granville and lord hartington      april 23 1880—soon after halfpast three today lord     granville and lord hartington arrived from windsor at my house     and signified to me the queen’s command that i should repair to     windsor where she would see me at halfpast six      the purport of lord hartington’s conversation with me yesterday     had been signified they had jointly advised thereupon that i     should be sent for with a view to the formation of a government     and her majesty desired lord granville would convey to me the     message i did not understand that there had been any lengthened     audience or any reference to details      receiving this intimation i read to them an extract from an     article in the daily news of yesterday371 descriptive of     their position relatively to me and of mine to them and said     that letting drop the epithets so i understood the matter i     presumed therefore that under the circumstances as they were     established before their audience they had unitedly advised the     sovereign that it was most for the public advantage to send for     me to this they assented i expressed a little later my sense     of the high honour and patriotism with which they had acted said     that i had endeavoured to fulfil my own duty but was aware i     might be subject to severe criticism for my resignation of the     leadership five years ago which i had forced upon them but i did     it believing in good faith that we were to have quiet times and     for the first years 1875 and 1876 and to the end of the session     i had acted in a manner conformable to that resignation and had     only been driven from my corner by compulsion they made no reply     but granville had previously told me he was perfectly satisfied as     to my communications with him      i at once asked whether i might reckon as i hoped on their     cooperation in the government both assented granville agreed to     take the foreign office but modestly and not as of right i     proposed the india office as next and as very near in weight and     perhaps the most difficult of all at this time to hartington     which he desired time to consider i named childers as the most     proper person for the war office as i had to prepare for windsor     our interview was not very long and they agreed to come again     after dinner      we spoke of the governorgeneralship at least i spoke to     granville who stayed a little after hartington and i said     goschen’s position as to the franchise would prevent his being in     the cabinet now but he should be in great employ granville had     had the lead in the conversation and said the queen requested     him to carry the message to me      audience at windsor      windsor castle april 23 1880—at 650 i went to the queen who     received me with perfect courtesy from which she never deviates     her majesty presumed i was in possession of the purport of her     communications with lord granville and with lord hartington and     wished to know as the administration of lord beaconsfield had     been “turned out” whether i was prepared to form a government     she thought she had acted constitutionally in sending for the     recognised leaders of the party and referring the matter to them     in the first instance i said that if i might presume to speak     nothing could in my views be more correct than her majesty’s view     that the application should be so made i did not refer to the     case as between lord granville and lord hartington and that it     would have been an error to pass them by and refer to me they had     stood i said between me and the position of a candidate for     office and it was only their advising her majesty to lay her     commands upon me which could warrant my thinking of it after all     that had occurred but since they had given this advice it was     not consistent with my duty to shrink from any responsibility     which i had incurred and i was aware that i had incurred a very     great responsibility i therefore humbly accepted her majesty’s     commission      her majesty wished to know in order that she might acquaint lord     beaconsfield whether i could undertake to form a government or     whether i only meant that i would make the attempt i said i had     obtained the cooperation of lord granville and lord hartington     and that my knowledge and belief as to prevailing dispositions     would i think warrant me in undertaking to form a government it     being her majesty’s pleasure i had ascertained that lord     granville would be willing to accept the foreign office and i had     also to say that the same considerations which made it my duty to     accept office seemed also to make it my duty to submit myself to     her majesty’s pleasure for the office of chancellor of the     exchequer together with that of first lord of the treasury      she asked if i had thought of any one for the war office which     was very important the report of the commission would show that     lord cardwell’s system of short service had entirely broken down     and that a change must be made at any rate as regarded the     noncommissioned officers lord hartington had assured her that no     one was committed to the system except lord cardwell and he was     very unwell and hardly able to act lord hartington knew the war     office and she thought would make a good war minister i said     that it seemed to me in the present state of the country the first     object was to provide for the difficulties of statesmanship and     then to deal with those of administration the greatest of all     these difficulties i thought centred in the india office and i     was very much inclined to think lord hartington would be eminently     qualified to deal with them and would thereby take a place in the     government suitable to his position and his probable future      she asked to whom then did i think of entrusting the war     office resumed this afternoon april 24372 i said mr     childers occurred to me as an administrator of eminent capacity     and conciliatory in his modes of action his mind would be open on     the grave subjects treated by the commission which did not appear     to me to be even for lord cardwell matters of committal but     simply of public policy to be determined by public advantage she     thought that mr childers had not been popular at the admiralty     and that it was desirable the secretary for war should be liked by     the army i said that there was an occurrence towards the close of     his term which placed him in a difficult position but relied on     his care and discretion she did not press the point but is     evidently under strong professional bias      she spoke of the chancellorship and i named lord selborne      she referred to general action and hoped it would be conciliatory     i said that every one who had served the crown for even a much     smaller term of years than i had the good or ill fortune to     reckon would know well that an incoming government must recognise     existing engagements and must take up irrespective of its     preferences whatever was required by the character and honour of     the country i referred to the case of scinde and sir r peel’s     cabinet in 1843 which she recognised as if it had been recently     before her      she said “i must be frank with you mr gladstone and must     fairly say that there have been some expressions”—i think she said     some little things which had caused her concern or pain i said     that her majesty’s frankness so well known was a main ground of     the entire reliance of her ministers upon her that i was     conscious of having incurred a great responsibility and felt the     difficulty which arises when great issues are raised and a man     can only act and speak upon the best lights he possesses aware     all the time that he may be in error that i had undoubtedly used     a mode of speech and language different in some degree from what i     should have employed had i been the leader of a party or a     candidate for office then as regarded conciliation in my opinion     the occasion for what i had described had wholly passed away and     that so far as i was concerned it was my hope that her majesty     would not find anything to disapprove in my general tone that my     desire and effort would be to diminish her cares in any case not     to aggravate them that however considering my years i could     only look to a short term of active exertion and a personal     retirement comparatively early with regard to the freedom of     language i had admitted she said with some goodnatured archness     “but you will have to bear the consequences” to which i entirely     assented she seemed to me if i may so say “natural under     effort” all things considered i was much pleased i ended by     kissing her majesty’s hand     iv   m200 the usual embarrassments in building a government filled many days with unintermittent labour of a kind that like peel mr gladstone found intensely harassing though interesting the duty of leaving out old colleagues can hardly have been other than painful but mr gladstone was a man of business and lie reckoned on a proper stoicism in the victims of public necessity to one of them he wrote “while i am the oldest man of my political generation i have been brought by the seeming force of exceptional circumstances to undertake a task requiring less of years and more of vigour than my accumulating store of the one and waning residue of the other and i shall be a solecism in the government which i have undertaken to form i do not feel able to ask you to resume the toils of office” etc but would like to name him the recipient for a signal mark of honour “i have not the least right to be disappointed when you select younger men for your colleagues” the cheerful man replied not all were so easily satisfied “it is cruel to make a disqualification for others out of an infirmity of my own” mr gladstone wrote to the oldest of his comrades in the peelite days but—et cetera et cetera and he would be glad to offer his old ally the red riband of the bath when one should be vacant the peer to whom this letter with its dubious solatium was addressed showed his chagrin by a reply of a single sentence that he did not wish to leave the letter unanswered lest it should seem to admit that he was in a state of health which he did not feel to be the case the red riband was not even declined one admirable man with intrepid naïveté proposed himself for the cabinet but was not admitted another no less admirable was pressed to enter but felt that he could be more useful as an independent member and declined—an honourable transaction repeated by the same person on more than one occasion later to one excellent member of his former cabinet the prime minister proposed the chairmanship of committee and it was with some tartness refused another equally excellent member of the old administration he endeavoured to plant out in the viceregal lodge at dublin without the cabinet but in vain to a third he proposed the indian viceroyalty and received an answer that left him “stunned and out of breath” as the hours passed and office after office was filled up curiosity grew vivacious as to the fate appointed for the younger generation of radicals the great posts had gone to patrician whigs just as if mr gladstone had been a grey or a russell as we have seen he had secured lord granville and lord hartington before he went to windsor and on the evening of his return the first person to whom he applied was lord derby one of the most sagacious men of his day but a great territorial noble and a very recent convert he declined office on the ground that if a man changes his party connection he is bound to give proof that he wishes the change from no merely personal motive and that he is not a gainer by it  mr bright had joined it was true and mr forster but bright the new radicals honoured and revered without any longer following and with forster they had quarrelled violently upon education nor was the quarrel ever healed one astute adviser well acquainted with the feeling and expectations of the left wing now discovered to his horror that mr gladstone was not in the least alive to the importance of the leaders of the radical section and had never dreamed of them for his cabinet his view seems to have been something of this kind “you have been saved from whig triumph in the person of lord hartington now that you have got me to keep the balance i must have a whig cabinet” he was moreover still addicted to what he called peel’s rule against admitting anybody straight into the cabinet without having held previous office at last he sent for sir charles dilke to his extreme amazement sir charles refused to serve unless either himself or mr chamberlain were in the cabinet the prime minister might make his choice between them then the other would accept a subordinate post mr gladstone discoursed severely on this unprecedented enormity and the case was adjourned mr bright was desired to interfere but the pair remained inexorable in the end the lot fell on mr chamberlain “your political opinions” mr gladstone wrote to him april 27 “may on some points go rather beyond what i may call the general measure of the government but i hope and believe that there can be no practical impediment on this score to your acceptance of my proposal” so mr chamberlain took office at the board of trade where mr gladstone himself had begun his effective career in administration nearly forty years before and his confederate went as undersecretary to the foreign office at that time the general feeling was that sir charles dilke long in parliament and a man of conspicuous mark within its walls was rather badly used and that mr gladstone ought to have included both all this was the ominous prelude of a voyage that was to be made through many storms373  one incident of these labours of construction may illustrate mr gladstone’s curious susceptibility in certain kinds of personal contest he proposed that mr lowe should be made a viscount while the queen thought that a barony would meet the claim for once it broke the prime minister’s sleep he got up in the middle of the night and dashed off a letter to windsor the letter written the minister went to bed again and was in an instant sound asleep  “the new parliament” he told his old friend at school and college sir francis doyle may 10 “will be tested by its acts it will not draw its inspiration from me no doubt it will make changes that will be denounced as revolutionary and then recognised as innocent and even good but i expect it to act in the main on welltried and established lines and do much for the people and little to disquiet my growing years or even yours” all fell out strangely otherwise and disquiet marked this second administration from its beginning to its end to lay all the blame on a prime minister or his cabinet for this is like blaming the navigator for wild weather in spite of storm and flood great things were done deep notable and abiding results ensued the procedure of parliament underwent a profound revolution so too did our electoral system in all its aspects new lines of cleavage showed themselves in the divisions of political party a not unimportant episode occurred in the chapter of religious toleration the irish peasant after suffering centuries of oppression and tyrannic wrong at last got the charter of his liberation in a more distant region as if to illustrate the power of events against the will of a statesman and the contemporary opinion of a nation england for good or evil found herself planted in the valley of the nile and became a landpower on the mediterranean      appendix     budget of 1860   page 26  sir william heathcote wrote to mr gladstone may 4 1861—  i understood you in your rebukes of lewis in 1857 to be aiming not only at a change of his plan of finance in that particular year but if that were impossible or at least could not be carried at a resumption as early as circumstances would allow of what you thought the proper line of action which he insisted on suspending incometax and war duties on tea and sugar were and would continue to be as i understood the primary claimants for reduction of taxation in your judgment the very vehemence of your convictions and expressions on both occasions perplexes me  mr gladstone replied the same day—   you think 1 that i bound myself to the reduction of the tea and sugar duties as a policy for future occasions and not merely for the issue then raised 2 that in like manner i was bound to the reduction and abolition of the incometax 3 that even if there arose in the system of our expenditure a great change involving an increase of ten or fifteen millions of money over 1853 i was still in consistency bound to hold over the first chance of reduction for incometax tea and sugar 4 that consequently until these duties were remitted i could not propose to prosecute any commercial reforms involving as nearly all of them do a sacrifice of revenue for a time 5 it is because i have departed from these positions by proposing a multitude of reductions and abolitions of duty other than the three mentioned and partly or wholly in preference to them that you have lost confidence in my judgment on these matters a confidence to which i do not pretend that i had ever any claim  if i have interpreted you aright and i hope you will tell me whether i have done so or not this is all to me exceedingly curious such are the differences in the opinions of men formed from their different points of view now i will give you mine to give effect to the pledge of honour by which i became bound in 1853 i made a desperate effort in 1857 with all the zeal of which i was capable and with all the passion to which i am liable it was my opinion that the course then taken would be decisive as to the operations in 1860 for the incometax never can be got rid of except by prospective finance reaching over several years and liable to impediment and disturbance accordingly i therefore protested against the whole scale of expenditure then proposed as well as against particular kinds of expenditure to which i might refer i likewise protested against the provision for that expenditure which the government of the day proposed first because the expenditure itself was excessive in my view secondly because in the mode of that provision i thought the remission of incometax was large out of all proportion to the remission on indirect taxes and this disproportion i regarded as highly dangerous i determined to let no political prejudice stand in my way and to test to the best of my very feeble power the opinion of parliament with respect to tea and sugar i stated that if the opinion of parliament were against me i should not factiously prolong the contest but should withdraw from it not only was the opinion of parliament against me but it so happened that the opinion of the country was immediately afterwards taken by a dissolution on that and on other kindred questions the country affirmed the policy of lord palmerston and the policy of a materially increased expenditure by an overwhelming majority i had misjudged public opinion they had read it aright after the dissolution of 1857 sir george lewis who had previously raised the tea and sugar duties for one year proposed to raise them for two more i immediately followed in debate and thanked him warmly for doing it all this of course i can prove i said we are going to have more expenditure we must therefore have more taxation  as i have gone thus far with my history i will conclude it notwithstanding what had happened i did not absolutely abandon at that time the hope that we might still reach in 1860 a state which might enable us to abolish the incometax i had a faint expectation of more economy under another government when lord derby’s administration came in in 1858 they professed to reduce expenditure by £800000 and to contemplate further reductions i expressed my satisfaction and gave them the extreme of support that i could but i then clearly pointed out that even with the scale of expenditure they then proposed we could not abolish the incometax in 1860 in a few months their reductions vanished into air in 1859 came the famous “reconstruction” i took office in june and found a scale of expenditure going on in the treasury far more prodigal and wanton than i had ever charged upon lord palmerston’s first government i found also that when the estimates had been completed i believe entirely on their basis there was a probable deficiency of four or five millions for a year of which nearly onethird had passed and the expenditure was i think nearly seventy millions or some fourteen millions more than in 1853 this was not the act only of the government the opposition halloed them on and the country seized with a peculiar panic was in a humour even more lavish than the opposition  my view was and i stated it that we ought to provide for this expenditure in a due proportion between direct and indirect taxes i showed that this proportion had not been observed that we had continued to levy large amounts of war tax on tea and sugar and had returned to the scale of 1853 for income i proposed to provide the necessary sums chiefly by an increase of incometax but neither then in july 1859 nor for nearly two and a half years before had i ever to my knowledge presumed to speak of any one as bound to abolish the incometax or to remit the additional duties on tea and sugar  i fully expect from you the admission that as to these measures i could not in the altered circumstances be bound absolutely to the remissions but you say i was bound to give them a preference over all other remissions nowhere i believe can one word to this effect be extracted from any speech of mine i found in 1860 that all the reforming legislation which had achieved such vast results had been suspended for seven years we were then raising by duties doomed in 1853 from twelve to thirteen millions it would in my opinion have been no less than monstrous on my part to recognise the preferences you claim for these particular duties all of them indeed would have been reliefs even the incometax which is i think proved to be the least relief of any but though reliefs they were hardly reforms and experience had shown us that reforms were in fact double and treble reliefs i may be wrong but it is my opinion and i found it on experience that the prospect of the removal of the three collectively income tea extra and sugar extra being in any case very remote it is less remote with than without the reforming measures of the last and i hope i may add of the present year had the expenditure of 1853 been resumed there would notwithstanding the russian war have been in my opinion room for all these three things 1 abolition of incometax by or near 1860 2 remission of increases on tea and sugar within the same time 3 the prosecution of the commercial reforms  it may be said that having set my face against an excess of expenditure i ought to have considered that a holy war and not to have receded although i place public economy somewhat higher as a matter of duty than many might do i do not think it would have been right i do think it would have been foolish and presumptuous in me to have gone beyond these two things first making an effort to the utmost of my power at the critical moment as i took it to be and secondly on being defeated to watch for opportunities thereafter since it should be remembered i do not recommend or desire sweeping and sudden reductions  the chief errors that i see myself to have committed are these in 1853 when i took the unusual course of estimating our income for seven years and assuming that our expenditure would either continue as it was or only move onwards gradually and gently i ought no doubt to have pointed out explicitly that a great disturbance and increase of our expenditure would baffle my reckonings again in 1857 the temper of the public mind had undergone a change which i failed to discern and i attacked the government and the chancellor of the exchequer of that day for doing what the country desired though i did not i name these as specific errors over and above the general one of excess of heat  the budget of last year i cannot admit to have been an error people say it should have been smaller my belief is that if it had been a smaller boat it would not have lived in such a sea i speak of the period of the session before the china war became certain when it did so we were in a great strait about the paper duty we felt the obligation incurred by the vote on the second reading and we construed it according to the established usage we took the more arduous but i think the more honourable course for a government to pursue had we abandoned the bill i know not how we could have looked in the face those who had acted and invested on the faith of an unbroken practice i admit that political motives greatly concurred to recommend the budget of last year it was a budget of peace and peace wanted it the budget of this year followed from the budget of last given the other circumstances at the same time i can understand how the claim of tea could be set up but not well after the occurrences of last year how it could be supported  this is a long egotistical story but when you consider that it contains my whole story except pièces justificatives in answer to so many speeches in both houses and elsewhere for never to this hour have i opened my lips in personal defence you will understand why i might be garrulous  notwithstanding the mild doctrine i have held about expenditure i admit it may be said i ought not to have joined a government which had such extended views in that direction even though they were the views of the nation much may be said on this i may however remark that when the government was formed i did not fully conceive the extent to which we should proceed     the cabinet 1860   page 36  mr gladstone’s memorandum on the currents of opinion in the cabinet of 1860 concludes as follows—  1 the most italian members of the cabinet have been lord palmerston lord john russell weg gibson argyll the least italian lewis wood grey herbert villiers especially  2 in foreign policy generally the most combative have been lord palmerston lord john russell duke of newcastle the chancellor the least combative duke of somerset duke of argyll granville gibson herbert lewis grey weg wood the same in feeling but not active  3 in defences and expenditure the most alarmed or most martial as the case may be have been lord palmerston lord john russell duke of newcastle s herbert followed by duke of somerset the chancellor granville cardwell inclined the other way gibson weg lewis grey duke of argyll elgin i think  4 in finance some are for movement some stationary or retrograde so as to be ready for immediate war yet here we are not divided simply as combative or anticombative the onward men in finance are lord john russell duke of newcastle granville argyll gibson weg and i think the chancellor the stationary men are first and foremost sir george lewis sir c wood next to these lord palmerston cardwell and i think villiers herbert  5 on reform i must distinguish between a extension of the franchise and b redistribution of seats in the first the more liberal men are lord john russell duke of somerset duke of newcastle duke of argyll gibson weg the fearful or opposed are lord palmerston c villiers s herbert in the second for small disfranchisement were i think all the first except newcastle for larger disfranchisement newcastle villiers and lord palmerston i think not greatly averse in fact i think that larger disfranchisement of places may have been favoured by him 1 as a substitute for enlargement of the franchise which he chiefly dreads 2 as perhaps an obstacle to the framing of a measure  6 in church matters herbert newcastle and i are the most conservative and the most churchlike with a sympathy from argyll but as i said there is no struggle here patronage the sore subject not being a cabinet affair     session of 1860   page 47  extract from a letter to the duke of argyll  penmaen september 3 1860—the session has been one to make all of us thoughtful and me perhaps most of all it is indeed much before my mind but my head has not ceased to whirl so that i cannot get a clear view of what seward would call my position two things i know one is that it produced the greatest pleasures and the greatest pains i have ever known in politics the other that 1 have had to take various decisions and perform acts that could neither be satisfactory to others nor from the doubt attaching to one side or the other of the alternative even to myself to have been the occasion of the blow to the house of commons or as i call it the “gigantic innovation” will be a grief to me as long as i live if by wildness and rashness i have been its cause it will be a much greater grief of that i am not yet able to judge on the whole when i think of the cabinet i always go back to jacob and esau fighting in their mother’s womb only here there have been many jacobs and esaus by which i do not mean the sixteen members of the cabinet but the many and very unhandy causes of division perhaps i should find it easiest in the work of confession to own my neighbour’s faults ie to dwell upon those strange sins of foreign policy which have happily for the most part been nipped in the bud almost à l’unanimité yet with what exceptions but avoiding that task i will make my own confession i cannot justify the finance of the year as a whole as to the amount of the final demand for the china war what it really demonstrates is one among the follies and dangers of our highhanded policy our want of control over proceedings at the other end of the world but the weak point is the fortification plan i do not now speak of its own merits or demerits but i speak of it in relation to the budget it is a vile precedent to give away money by remission and borrow to supply the void and in the full and chief responsibility for having established this precedent i am involved not by the budget of february but by the consent of july to the scheme which involved the borrowing no doubt there are palliating circumstances and lastly the grievous difficulty of choice between mischievous illegible and mischievous resignation still i must say it is in retrospect as the people and parliament have a right to judge it a bad and unworkmanlike business and under a skilful analysis of it in the house of commons which there is no one opposite fit to make except it be northcote who perhaps scruples it i should wince all these things and others more inward than these make sore places in the mind but on the other hand that i may close with a gleam of sunshine like that which is now casting its shadow on my paper from penmaenmawr after a rough morning i am thankful in the highest degree to have had a share in resisting the alarmist mania of the day by means of the french treaty to which if we escape collision i think the escape will have been mainly due and likewise in one at least negative service to the great italian cause which is not italian merely but european     mr pitt’s war finance   page 59  mr gladstone to herbert gladstone  march 10 1876—mr pitt’s position in the revolutionary war was i think a false one to keep out of that war demanded from the people of this country an extraordinary degree of selfcontrol and this degree of it they did not possess the consequence of our going into it was to give an intensity and vitality to the struggle which but for the tenacity of english character it would not have possessed mr pitt did not show the great genius in war which he possessed as a peace minister until the epoch of the peninsula our military performances were small and poor and the method of subsidy was unsatisfactory and ineffective the effect of borrowing money in three per cents was to load us with a very heavy capital of national debt i think at one time we only got £46 or some such amount for the £100 it must however be taken into view that a perpetual annuity of £3 redeemable upon paying £100 brought more than 34 of what a perpetual annuity of £4 similarly redeemable would have brought or than 35 of what a £5 annuity similarly redeemable would have brought it is not easy to strike the balance mr newmarch a living economist of some authority i believe thinks mr pitt was right i do not think the case is so clear against him as to detract from his great reputation but were i in the unhappy position of having to call for a large loan i should be disposed to ask for the tender in more than one form eg to ask for a tender in three per cents pure and simple and an alternative in 4 or 5 per cents with that rate of interest guaranteed for a certain number of years sir robert walpole had not to contend with like difficulties and i think his administration should be compared with the early years of pitt’s in which way of judging he would come off second though a man of cool and sagacious judgment while morally he stood low     french commercial treaty 1860   page 66  mr gladstone at leeds october 8 1881—  i for my part look with the deepest interest upon the share that i had in concluding—i will not say so much in concluding but in conducting on this side of the water and within the walls of parliament as well as in administration—the proceedings which led to the memorable french treaty of 1860 it is quite true that that treaty did not produce the whole of the benefits that some too sanguine anticipations may possibly have expected from it that it did not produce a universal smash of protective duties as i wish it had throughout the civilised world but it did something it enormously increased the trade between this country and france it effectually checked and traversed in the year 1860 tendencies of a very different kind towards needless alarms and panics and tendencies towards convulsions and confusion in europe there was no more powerful instrument for confining and controlling those wayward and angry spirits at that particular crisis than the commercial treaty with france it produced no inconsiderable effect for a number of years upon the legislation of various european countries which tended less decisively than we could have desired but still intelligibly and beneficially in the direction of freedom of trade     lord aberdeen   page 87  mr gladstone to sir arthur gordon lord stanmore  downing street april 21 1861—my dear arthur—when within a few days after your father’s death i referred in conversation with you to one or two points in his character it was from the impulse of the moment and without any idea of making my words matter of record months have now passed since you asked me to put on paper the substance of what i said the delay has been partly perhaps mainly owing to the pressure of other demands upon my time and thoughts but it has also been due to this that an instinct similar to that which made me speak has made me shrink from writing it is enough in conversation to give the most partial and hasty touches provided they be not in the main untrue those same touches when clothed in a form of greater assumption have but a meagre and unsatisfactory appearance and may do even positive injustice most of all in the case of a character which was not only of rare quality but which was so remarkable for the fineness of its lights and shadows but you have a right to my recollections such as they are and i will not withhold them  i may first refer to the earliest occasion on which i saw him for it illustrates a point not unimportant in his history on an evening in the month of january 1835 during what is called the short government of sir robert peel i was sent for by sir robert peel and received from him the offer which i accepted of the undersecretaryship of the colonies from him i went on to your father who was then secretary of state in that department and who was thus to be in official hometalk my master without any apprehension of hurting you i may confess that i went in fear and trembling then follows the passage already quoted in vol i p 124 i was only i think for about ten weeks his undersecretary but as some men hate those whom they have injured so others love those whom they have obliged and his friendship continued warm and unintermitting for the subsequent twentysix years of his life  some of his many great qualities adorned him in common with several or even with many other contemporary statesmen such as clearness of view strength of the deliberative faculty strong sense of duty deep devotion to the crown and the most thorough and uncompromising loyalty to his friends and colleagues in this loyalty of intention many i think are not only praiseworthy but perfect but the loyalty of intention was in him so assisted by other and distinctive qualities as to give it a peculiar efficacy and any one associated with lord aberdeen might always rest assured that he was safe in his hands when our law did not allow prisoners the benefit of counsel it was commonly said that the judge was counsel for the prisoner lord aberdeen was always counsel for the absent doubtless he had pondered much upon the law “thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” it had entered profoundly into his being and formed a large part of it he was strong in his selfrespect but his respect for others not for this man or that but for other men as men was much more conspicuous rarely indeed have i heard him utter a word censuring opponents or concerning those who actually were or had been friends that could have given pain if and when it was done it was done so to speak judicially upon full and reluctant conviction and with visible regret  if i have said that he had much in common with other distinguished men who were like him statesmen by profession it has been by way of preface to what i have now to say namely that what has ever struck me in his character as a whole was its distinctiveness there were several mental virtues that he possessed in a degree very peculiar there were i think one or two in which he stood almost alone i am not in myself well qualified for handling a subject like this and also my life has been too hurried to give me the most favourable opportunities still i must try to explain my meaning i will name then the following characteristics one and all of which were more prominent in him than in any public man i ever knew mental calmness the absence if for want of better words i may describe it by a negative of all egoism the love of exact justice a thorough tolerance of spirit and last and most of all an entire absence of suspicion  there was something very remarkable in the combination of these qualities as well as in their separate possession most men who might be happy enough to have one half his love of justice would be so tossed with storms of indignation at injustice as to lose the balance of their judgment but he had or seemed to have all the benefits all the ennobling force of strong emotion with a complete exemption from its dangers his mind seemed to move in an atmosphere of chartered tranquillity which allowed him the view of every object however blinding to others in its true position and proportion  it has always appeared to me that the love of justice is one of the rarest among all good qualities i mean the love of it with full and commanding strength i should almost dare to say there are five generous men to one just man the beauty of justice is the beauty of simple form the beauty of generosity is heightened with colour and every accessory the passions will often ally themselves with generosity but they always tend to divert from justice the man who strongly loves justice must love it for its own sake and such a love makes of itself a character of a simple grandeur to which it is hard to find an equal  next to lord aberdeen i think sir robert peel was the most just of the just men i have had the happiness to know during the years from 1841 to 1846 when they were respectively foreign secretary and prime minister as i was at the board of trade for much of the time i had occasion to watch the two in the conduct of several negotiations that involved commercial interests such as that on the stade dues and that on the project of a commercial treaty with portugal now and then sir robert peel would show some degree of unconscious regard to the mere flesh and blood if i may so speak of englishmen lord aberdeen was invariably for putting the most liberal construction upon both the conduct and the claims of the other negotiating state  there is perhaps no position in this country in which the love of justice that i have ascribed in such extraordinary measure to your father can be so severely tested as that very position of foreign minister with which his name is so closely associated nowhere is a man so constantly and in such myriad forms tempted to partiality nowhere can he do more for justice but nowhere is it more clear that all human force is inadequate for its end a nation is rarely just to other nations perhaps it is never truly just though sometimes like individuals what may be called more than just there can be no difficulty in any country least of all this in finding foreign ministers able and willing to assert the fair and reasonable claims of their countrymen with courage and with firmness the difficulty is quite of another kind it is to find the foreign minister first who will himself view those claims in the dry light both of reason and of prudence secondly and a far harder task who will have the courage to hazard and if need be to sacrifice himself in keeping the mind of his countrymen down to such claims as are strictly fair and reasonable lord aberdeen was most happy in being secretary of state for foreign affairs in the time and in the political company of two such men as the duke of wellington and sir robert peel he was also happy in the general prevalence of a spirit of great sobriety in the country which was singularly free under the government of sir robert peel from the opposite but sometimes associated extremes of wantonness and fear i am glad to think that his administration of his department earned a decided public approval so just a man will i think rarely attain in that department to the same measure of popularity while a less just man might easily obtain one far greater  to fall short of perfect candour would deprive all i have said of the little value it can possess as that little value is all summed up in its sincerity on one subject to which my mind has been directed for the last twelve or fourteen years i had the misfortune to differ from your father i mean the state of italy and its relation to austria in particular i will not pretend to say that his view of the case of italy appeared to me to harmonize with his general mode of estimating human action and political affairs it seemed to me as if called in early youth to deal with a particular combination of questions which were truly gigantic his mind had received from their weight and force at an impressible period a fixed form in relation to them while it ever remained open and elastic in a peculiar degree upon all others but my mode of solution for what appeared to me an anomaly is immaterial i thankfully record that the italian question was almost the only one within my recollection quite the only one of practical importance on which during the twentysix years i have named i was unable to accept his judgment i bear witness with yet greater pleasure that when i returned from naples in 1851 deeply impressed with the horrible system that i had witnessed his opinions on italian politics did not prevent his readily undertaking to read the statement i had drawn nor his using when he had read it more strong words on the subject which came from lips like his with such peculiar force as readily did he undertake to invoke the aid of the court of vienna to which if i remember right he transmitted the statement in manuscript  though i feel that i cannot by any effort do justice to what i have termed his finelyshaded character i also feel that i might be drawn onwards to great length on the subject i must resist the impulse but i cannot stop without saying a word on the quality which i regard as beyond all others his own i mean the absence from his nature of all tendency to suspicion those who have read his state papers and have admired their penetrating force and comprehensive scope will not misunderstand me when i say that he was in this respect a little child not from defect of vision but from thorough nobleness of nature  i do not think it was by effort and selfcommand that he rid himself of suspicion in the simple and strong aim of the man to be good himself it belonged to the very strength and simplicity of that aim that he should also think others good i recollect and i dare say you better recollect one of his sayings “i have a habit of believing people” to some these words may not seem to import a peculiarity but as descriptive of him they indicate what of all the points of his character seemed to me most peculiar i have known one man as free from suspicions as was lord aberdeen but he was not a politician i am far from thinking statesmen or politicians less honourable than other men quite the reverse but the habit of their life renders them suspicious the vicissitudes of politics the changes of position the changes of alliance the sharp transitions from cooperation to antagonism the inevitable contact with revolting displays of selfseeking and selflove more than all these perhaps the constant habit of forecasting the future and shaping all its contingencies beforehand which is eminently the merit and intellectual virtue of the politician all these tend to make him and commonly do make him suspicious even of his best friend this suspicion may be found to exist in conjunction with regard with esteem nay with affection for it must be recollected that it is not usually a suspicion of moral delinquency but at least as it dwells in the better and higher natures of intellectual error only in some of its numerous forms or at most of speaking with a reserve that may be more or less or even wholly unconscious none of these explanations are needed for lord aberdeen he always took words in their direct and simple meaning and assumed them to be the index of the mind and its full index too so that he did not speculate to learn what undiscovered residue might still remain in its dark places this entire immunity from suspicion which makes our minds in general like a haunted place and the sense of the immunity that he conveyed to his friends in all his dealings with them combined with the deep serenity of his mind which ever seemed to beguile and allay by some kindly process of nature excitement in others gave an indescribable charm to all intercourse with him in critical and difficult circumstances hence perhaps in great part and not merely from his intellectual gifts was derived the remarkable power he seemed to me to exercise in winning confidences without seeking to win them and on the whole i believe that this quality could we hold it as it was held in him would save us from ten erroneous judgments for one into which it might lead for the grand characteristic of suspicion after all as of superstition is to see things that are not  i turn now to another point lord aberdeen was not demonstrative i do not suppose he could have been an actor he was unstudied in speech and it is of interest to inquire what it was that gave such extraordinary force and impressiveness to his language he did not deal in antithesis his sayings were not sharpened with gall in short one might go on disclaiming for him all the accessories to which most men who are impressive owe their impressiveness yet i never knew any one who was so impressive in brief utterances conveying the sum of the matter  history has also caught and will hold firmly and well the honoured name of your father there was no tarnish upon his reputation more than upon his character he will be remembered in connection with great passages of european policy not only as a man of singularly searching large and calm intelligence but yet more as the just man the man that used only true weights and measures and ever held even the balance of his ordered mind it is no reproach to other statesmen of this or other periods to say that scarcely any of them have had a celebrity so entirely unaided by a transitory glare but if this be so it implies that while they for the most part must relatively lose he must relatively and greatly gain if they have had stagelights and he has had none it is the hour when those lights are extinguished that will for the first time do that justice as between them which he was too noble too far aloft in the tone of his mind to desire to anticipate all the qualities and parts in which he was great were those that are the very foundationstones of our being as foundationstones they are deep and as being deep they are withdrawn from view but time is their witness and their friend and in the final distribution of posthumous fame lord aberdeen has nothing to forfeit he has only to receive  i see on perusing what i have written that in the endeavour to set forth the virtues and great qualities of your father i seem more or less to disparage other men including even sir robert peel whom he so much esteemed and loved i had no such intention and it is the fault of my hand not of my will he would not have claimed he would not have wished nor borne that others should claim for him superiority or even parity in all points with all his contemporaries but there was a certain region of character which was so to speak all his own and there other men do seem more or less dwarfed beside him in the combination of profound feeling with a calm of mind equally profound of thorough penetration with the largest charity of the wisdom of the serpent with the harmlessness of the dove in the total suppression and exclusion of self from his reckonings and actions—in all this we may think him supreme and yet have a broad array of good and noble qualities in which he may have shared variously with others there are other secrets of his character and inner life into which i do not pretend to have penetrated it always seemed to me that there was a treasurehouse within him which he kept closed against the eyes of men he is gone he has done well in his generation may peace and light be with him and may honour and blessing long

humble duty to your majesty and reports that the cabinet met at 11 this day and considered with anxious care its position and duty in regard to the irish church bill the vote and declaration of the house of lords last night were regarded as fatal if persisted in and the cabinet deemed it impossible to meet proceedings of such a character with any tender of further concessions the cabinet however considered at much length a variety of courses as 1 to announce at once that they could no longer after the vote and announcement of last night be responsible for further proceedings in connection with the bill but that they would leave it to the majority of the house of lords to take such steps as it might think proper 2 to go through the whole of the amendments of the bill ie in the house of lords and then if they were adversely carried to declare and proceed as above 3 to go through not the whole of the amendments but the endowment amendments and to conclude that when these had been adversely decided they could as before assume no further responsibility but must leave the matter to the majority to consider 4 to send the bill back to the house of commons with the declaration that it would not be accepted there and with the intention of simply moving the house to adhere to its amendments as last adjusted  your majesty has already been apprized by mr gladstone’s telegram in cipher of this afternoon that under the influence of a strong desire to exhibit patience and to leave open every opportunity for reconsideration the third of these courses had been adopted although there was no doubt that the house of commons was fully prepared to approve and sustain the first lord granville deemed it just possible that the peers might be prepared to give way before another return of the bill from the house of commons and the question therefore was left open whether if evidence to this effect should appear the government should then fall in with that course of proceeding although the government have felt it to be impossible to make biddings in the face of the opposition the archbishop of canterbury has been apprised in strict confidence of the nature and extent of the concession which for the sake of peace they would be prepared to recommend sir r palmer is also substantially aware of it and has expressed his opinion that on such terms the opposition ought to be ready to conclude the matter     board and voluntary schools   page 310  mr gladstone to m bright  aug 21 1873—an appeal to me was made to introduce board schools into hawarden on account of my share in the education act i stated the two views held by different supporters of the act respectively on the question of board schools and voluntary schools for myself i said not in education only but in all things including education i prefer voluntary to legal machinery when the thing can be well done either way but this question is not to be decided by a general preference or a general formula parliament has referred it to the choice of the local communities they should decide according to the facts of the case before them what are the facts in hawarden fourfifths are already provided for were it only onefifth or were it twofifths the case for the board i said would be overwhelming but besides the fourfifths arrangements are already made for a further provision in a voluntary school nothing remains to be done except to build three infant schools the voluntary schools will be governed by a committee including the churchwardens and having a majority of laymen the machinery of a board is of necessity cumbrous and the method costly in comparison i hold that we ought not to set up this machinery in order to create three infant schools where all the other wants of some 2000 people are already provided for     views on a classical education   page 312  mr gladstone to lord lyttelton  penmaenmawr aug 29 1861—thanks for the brief notice which you recently took of the public schools commission i was heartily glad to hear that you had formed a drastic set of questions i take the deepest interest in the object of the commission and i have full confidence in its members and organs and at all times i shall be very glad to hear what you are doing meantime i cannot help giving you to be taken for what it is worth the sum of my own thoughts upon the subject the low utilitarian argument in matter of education for giving it what is termed a practical direction is so plausible that i think we may on the whole be thankful that the instincts of the country have resisted what in argument it has been ill able to confute we still hold by the classical training as the basis of a liberal education parents dispose of their children in early youth accordingly but if they were asked why they did so it is probable they would give lamentably weak or unworthy reasons for it such for example as that the public schools and universities open the way to desirable acquaintance and what is termed “good society” your commission will not i presume be able to pass by this question but will have to look it in the face and to proceed either upon a distinct affirmative or a substantial negative of the proposition that the classical training is the proper basis of a liberal education i hope you will hold by affirmation and reject negation  but the reason why i trouble you upon the subject is this that i think the friends of this principle have usually rather blinked the discussion and have been content with making terms of compromise by way of buying off the adversary which might be in themselves reasonable unless they were taken as mere instalments of a transaction intended in the long run to swallow up the principle itself what i feel is that the relation of pure science natural science modern languages modern history and the rest of the old classical training ought to be founded on a principle and ought not to be treated simply as importunate creditors that take a shilling in the £ today because they hope to get another shilling tomorrow and in the meantime have a recognition of their title this recognition of title is just what i would refuse i deny their right to a parallel or equal position their true position is auxiliary and as auxiliary it ought to be limited and restrained without scruple as a regard to the paramount matter of education may dictate  but why after all is the classical training paramount is it because we find it established because it improves memory or taste or gives precision or develops the faculty of speech all these are but partial and fragmentary statements so many narrow glimpses of a great and comprehensive truth that truth i take to be that the modern european civilisation from the middle age downwards is the compound of two great factors the christian religion for the spirit of man and the greek and in a secondary degree the roman discipline for his mind and intellect st paul is the apostle of the gentiles and is in his own person a symbol of this great wedding—the place for example of aristotle and plato in christian education is not arbitrary nor in principle mutable the materials of what we call classical training were prepared and we have a right to say were advisedly prepared in order that it might become not a mere adjunct but in mathematical phrase the complement of christianity in its application to the culture of the human being formed both for this world and for the world to come  if this principle be true it is broad and high and clear enough and supplies a key to all questions connected with the relation between the classical training of our youth and all other branches of their secular education it must of course be kept within its proper place and duly limited as to things and persons it can only apply in full to that small proportion of the youth of any country who are to become in the fullest sense educated men it involves no extravagant or inconvenient assumptions respecting those who are to be educated for trades and professions in which the necessities of specific training must limit general culture it leaves open every question turning upon individual aptitudes and inaptitudes and by no means requires that boys without a capacity for imbibing any of the spirit of classical culture are still to be mechanically plied with the instruments of it after their unfitness has become manifest but it lays down the rule of education for those who have no internal and no external disqualification and that rule becoming a fixed and central point in the system becomes also the point around which all others may be grouped  mr gladstone to sir s northcote  nov 12 1861—the letter i wrote to lyttelton about the classical education suggested topics which as you justly perceive are altogether esoteric they have never to my knowledge been carefully worked out and i think they well deserve it but clearly your report is not the place i will not say you are not prudent in suggesting that you should not even give an opinion upon the great question what is the true place of the old classical learning in the human culture of the nineteenth century i am far from venturing to say the contrary but one thing i do think namely that it is desirable that as far as may be the members of the commission should have some answer to that question in their minds and should write their report with reference to it for centuries through the lifetime of our great schools this classical culture has been made the lapis angularis of all secular culture of the highest class was this right or was it wrong aye or no i think it much to be desired that the commission should if they will proceed upon the affirmative or negative of that proposition and should also make their choice for the former this would be a long note to their report but it need not be distinctly and separately heard in it such is my notion as to particulars i have little to say that is worth hearing but i think these three things first that we give much too little scope for deviation from what i think the normal standard to other and useful branches when it has become evident that the normal standard is inapplicable just as was the case in oxford before the reform of the examinations or let me rather say the new statutes secondly i am extremely jealous of any invasion of modern languages which is to displace classical culture or any portion of it in minds capable of following that walk i take it that among the usual modern tongues italian has by far the greatest capacity for strict study and scholarship whereas it is the one least in favour and the whole method of dealing with them is quite alien to strict study lastly i confess i grieve over the ignorance of natural history which i feel in myself and believe to exist in others at some time in some way much more of all this ought to be brought in but clearly it would serve in a great degree as recreation and need not thrust aside whatever hard work boys are capable of doing     position of the commanderinchief in parliament   page 362  mr gladstone to the queen  july 8 1871—mr gladstone believes that according to precedent the commanderinchief when a peer has not shrunk from giving his opinion on measures submitted to the house of lords in 1847 the government of that day introduced the short service bill of which on the merits it is believed that the duke of wellington then commanderinchief did not approve indeed he expressed in debate on april 26th 1847 his doubts whether the measure would produce the advantages which were anticipated from it nevertheless while having no political connection with the government he spoke and voted in a division for the bill it is probable as the numbers were only 108 to 94 that his speech and vote alone carried the bill your majesty will not fail to bear in mind that until 1855 there was always a very high military authority who was in political connection with the government namely the master of the ordnance indeed unless mr gladstone’s recollection deceives him lord beresford was required by the duke of wellington in 1829 as master of the ordnance to support the roman catholic relief bill and it is still regretted by many that ministries have not since comprehended any such officer all question however as to the political support of a ministry by the military chiefs of the army is now at an end     a soldier at the war office   page 363  mr gladstone to mr cardwell  jan 5 1871—it was a great advantage before 1854 that there was always a considerable soldier either in the cabinet or at least at the head of an important military department and politically associated with the government this we lost by the crude and illadvised reconstructions of ’55 but you following in this point a wise initiative of your predecessor have endeavoured to bring the appointment of sir h storks into a position which makes it probably the best substitute for the former plan that can be had at present the demand that a soldier shall be appointed at the present time would hold good a fortiori for all periods of greater emergency i know not where that principle has been admitted in our military administration if we have committed gross errors it has been owing to an excess much more than to a defect of professional influence and counsel in my opinion the qualities of a good administrator and statesman go to make a good war minister especially at this juncture far more than those of a good soldier show me the soldier who has those equally with you and then let him take your place as ss but not till then you were chosen for your office not because you would do tolerably for easy times and then could walk out but because you were the best man the party could supply for the post the reproaches aimed at you now are merely aimed at the government through you and you are chosen to be the point of attack because the nation is sore on military matters in times of crisis and the press which ought to check excitement by most of its instruments ministers to its increase you find yourself unable to suggest a successor and i have seen no plan that would not weaken the government instead of strengthening it you see what eulogies have been passed on bright now he is gone you would rise in the market with many after resigning to depreciate those who remain behind but as i have said you would not be allowed to have had a legitimate cause of going and as far as my observation goes retirements are quite as critically judged as acceptances of office perhaps more so what is really to be desired is that we should get storks into parliament if possible     mr gladstone’s financial legacy 1869   page 372  mr gladstone to mr lowe  hawarden jan 9 1869—i have referred to my list of remnants and i will begin with those that i tried in parliament and failed in 1 collection of taxes by queen’s officers instead of local officers 2 taxation of charities 3 bill for restraining with a view to ultimately abolishing the circulation of the notes of private banks 4 plan for bringing the chancery and other judicial accounts under the control of parliament here i had a commission on chancery accounts but did not dare to go farther  the following are subjects which i was not able to take in hand—  1 abolition of the remaining duty upon corn an exceeding strong case 2 i should be much disposed to abolish the tea licences as greatly restrictive of the consumption of a dutiable and useful commodity i modified them but am not sure that this was enough the bir could throw light on this subject 3 the probate duty calls i fear loudly for change but i wanted either time or courage to take it in hand 4 the remaining conveyance duties apart from railways i always considered as marked for extinction on this subject mr ayrton has rather decided antecedents 5 the fire insurance duty is sure to be further assailed though not as bad relatively to other taxes as is supposed it is bad enough to be very hard to defend in an adverse house and this is one of the questions on which it is not likely that the opposition will help to see fair play the promises that liberal reduction will lead to recovery of anything like the old or previous revenue have always been confidently pressed by irresponsible men and are in my opinion illusory the tax is a tax on property and as we have too few of these rather than too many what would seem desirable is to commute it leaving no more than a penny stamp on the policy this might perhaps be done if it were made part of a large budget 6 the incometax at 6d i suppose presents a forward claim 7 the commutation of malt duty for beer duty must always i presume be spoken of with respect but the working objections to it have thus far been found too hard to deal with  there is always room in detail for amendments of stamp duties but the great case as among them is the probate they are of a class which without any legal knowledge i found very hard to work through the house of commons i do not look upon the act of 1844 as the end of legislation in currency but this subject is a big one scotch and irish notes would be hard to deal with until the english case is disposed of i forget whether we have abolished the last of the restrictions on newspapers if not they deserve to be taken in hand according to me i have always wished to equalise the outgoings of the exchequer as much as possible over the several weeks of the year few incomes admit of this advantage in the same degree as the public income it would make our “account” much more valuable to our bankers therefore to us  these i think were the main matters which lay more or less in perspective before me i must add that i am strongly in favour of paying off the national debt not only by annual surpluses but by terminable annuities sold to the national debt commissioners for securities held by them against deposit monies the opponents of this plan were mr hubbard and mr laing i am satisfied that neither of them had taken the trouble and it requires some trouble to understand it i admit them to be no mean authorities terminable annuities sold to others than yourself are quite another matter i got into the law some power of this kind over post office savings bank monies to be exercised by the chancellor of the exchequer from time to time  this is all i need trouble you with and i have endeavoured to keep clear of all idiosyncratic propositions as much as in me lies of course such a letter calls for no answer as this legacy opinion to you takes the form of a donation inter vivos it will i hope escape duty     prince albert 1854   page 426  mr gladstone wrote an elaborate article in the morning chronicle jan 16 1854 warmly defending the court against attacks that had clouded the popularity of the prince consort they came to little more than that the prince attended meetings of the privy council that he was present when the queen gave an audience to a minister that he thwarted ministerial counsels and gave them an unenglish character that in corresponding with relatives abroad he used english influence apart from the queen’s advisers mr gladstone had no great difficulty in showing how little this was worth either as fact supported by evidence or as principle supported by the fitness of things and he put himself on the right ground “we do not raise the question whether if the minister thinks it right to communicate with the sovereign alone he is not entitled to a private audience but we unhesitatingly assert that if the prince is present when the queen confers with her advisers and if his presence is found to be disadvantageous to the public interests we are not left without a remedy for the minister is as distinctly responsible for those interests in this as in any other matter and he is bound on his responsibility to parliament to decline compliance even with a personal wish of the sovereign when he believes that his assent would be injurious to the country”     parliamentary crises   page 451  extract from mr gladstone’s letter to the queen march 15 1873  there have been within that period 18301873 twelve of what may be properly called parliamentary crises involving the question of a change of government in nine of the twelve cases viz those of 1830 1835 1841 1846 1852 1858 1859 1866 and 1868 the party which had been in opposition was ready to take and did take office in the other three it failed to do this viz in 1832 1851 1855 and the old ministry or a modification of it returned to power but in each of these three cases the attempt of the opposition to form a government was not relinquished until after such efforts had been made by its leaders to carry the conviction to the world that all its available means of action were exhausted and there is no instance on record during the whole period or indeed so far as mr gladstone remembers at an earlier date in which a summary refusal given on the instant by the leader was tendered as sufficient to release the opposition from the obligations it had incurred this is the more remarkable because in two of the three instances the opposition had not in the same mode or degree as on wednesday morning last contributed by concerted action to bring about the crisis on the 7th of may 1832 the opposition of the day carried in the house of lords a motion which went only to alter the order of the opening and doubtless very important clauses of the reform bill but which the government of lord grey deemed fatal to the integrity of the measure their resignation was announced and lord lyndhurst was summoned to advise king william iv on the 9th of may on the 12th the duke of wellington was called to take a share in the proceedings the details of which are matters of history it was only on the 15th that the duke and lord lyndhurst found their resources at an end when lord grey was again sent for and on the 17th the duke announced in the house of lords his abandonment of the task he had strenuously endeavoured to fulfil on the 20th february 1851 the government of lord russell was defeated in the house of commons on mr locke king’s bill for the enlargement of the county franchise by a majority composed of its own supporters lord derby then lord stanley being sent for by your majesty on the 22nd observed that there were at the time three parties in the house of commons and that the ministry had never yet been defeated by his political friends he therefore counselled your majesty to ascertain whether the government of lord russell could not be strengthened by a partial reconstruction and failing that measure he engaged to use his own best efforts to form an administration that attempt at reconstruction to which nothing similar is now in question did fail and lord derby was therefore summoned by your majesty on the 25th and at once applied himself as is well known to every measure which seemed to give him a hope of success in constructing a government on the 27th he apprised your majesty of his failure in these efforts and on march 3rd the cabinet of lord russell returned to office this recital is founded on lord derby’s statement in the house of lords feb 28 1851 on jan 29 1855 the government of lord aberdeen was defeated in the house of commons on a motion made by an independent member of their own party and supported by twentyfive of the liberal members present though this defeat resembles the one last named in that it cannot be said to be due to the concerted action of the opposition as a party lord derby being summoned by your majesty on the 1st of feb proceeded to examine and ascertain in every quarter the means likely to be at his disposal for rendering assistance in the exigency and it was not until feb 3 that he receded from his endeavours     cabinet of
