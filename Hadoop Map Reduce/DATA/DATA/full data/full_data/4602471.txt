4602471	literary friends and acquaintancesthe white mr longfellow  by william dean howells    the white mr longfellow  we had expected to stay in boston only until we could find a house in old cambridge this was not so simple a matter as it might seem for the ancient town had not yet quickened its scholarly pace to the modern step indeed in the spring of 1866 the impulse of expansion was not yet visibly felt anywhere the enormous material growth that followed the civil war had not yet begun in cambridge the houses to be let were few and such as there were fell either below our pride or rose above our purse i wish i might tell how at last we bought a house we had no money but we were rich in friends who are still alive to shrink from the story of their constant faith in a financial future which we sometimes doubted and who backed their credulity with their credit it is sufficient for the present record which professes to be strictly literary to notify the fact that on the first day of may 1866 we went out to cambridge and began to live in a house which we owned in fee if not in deed and which was none the less valuable for being covered with mortgages physically it was a carpenters box of a sort which is readily imagined by the angloamerican genius for ugliness but which it is not so easy to impart a just conception of a trim hedge of arborvita tried to hide it from the world in front and a tall board fence behind the little lot was well planted perhaps too well planted with pears grapes and currants and there was a small open space which i lost no time in digging up for a kitchengarden on one side of us were the open fields on the other a brief line of neighborhouses across the street before us was a grove of stately oaks which i never could persuade aldrich had painted leaves on them in the fall we were really in a poor suburb of a suburb but such is the fascination of ownership even the ownership of a fully mortgaged property that we calculated the latitude and longitude of the whole earth from the spot we called ours in our walks about cambridge we saw other places where we might have been willing to live only we said they were too far off we even prized the architecture of our little box though we had but so lately lived in a gothic palace on the grand canal in venice and were not uncritical of beauty in the possessions of others positive beauty we could not have honestly said we thought our cottage had as a whole though we might have held out for something of the kind in the brackets of turned wood under its eaves but we were richly content with it and with life in cambridge as it began to open itself to us we were infinitely more than content this life so refined so intelligent so gracefully simple i do not suppose has anywhere else had its parallel     i  it was the moment before the old american customs had been changed by european influences among people of easier circumstances and in cambridge society kept what was best of its village traditions and chose to keep them in the full knowledge of different things nearly every one had been abroad and nearly every one had acquired the taste for olives without losing a relish for native sauces through the intellectual life there was an entire democracy and i do not believe that since the capitalistic era began there was ever a community in which money counted for less there was little show of what money could buy i remember but one private carriage naturally a publishers and there was not one livery except a livery in the larger sense kept by the stableman pike who made us pay now a quarter and now a half dollar for a seat in his carriages according as he lost or gathered courage for the charge we thought him extortionate and we mostly walked through snow and mud of amazing depth and thickness  the reader will imagine how acceptable this circumstance was to a young literary man beginning life with a fully mortgaged house and a salary of untried elasticity if there were distinctions made in cambridge they were not against literature and we found ourselves in the midst of a charming society indifferent apparently to all questions but those of the higher education which comes so largely by nature that is to say in the cambridge of that day and i dare say of this a mind cultivated in some sort was essential and after that came civil manners and the willingness and ability to be agreeable and interesting but the question of riches or poverty did not enter even the question of family which is of so great concern in new england was in abeyance perhaps it was taken for granted that every one in old cambridge society must be of good family or he could not be there perhaps his mere residence tacitly ennobled him certainly his acceptance was an informal patent of gentility to my mind the structure of society was almost ideal and until we have a perfectly socialized condition of things i do not believe we shall ever have a more perfect society the instincts which governed it were not such as can arise from the sordid competition of interests they flowed from a devotion to letters and from a selfsacrifice in material things which i can give no better notion of than by saying that the outlay of the richest college magnate seemed to be graduated to the income of the poorest  in those days the men whose names have given splendor to cambridge were still living there i shall forget some of them in the alphabetical enumeration of louis agassiz francis j child richard henry dana jun john fiske dr asa gray the family of the jameses father and sons lowell longfellow charles eliot norton dr john g palfrey james pierce dr peabody professor parsons professor sophocles the variety of talents and of achievements was indeed so great that mr bret harte when fresh from his pacific slope justly said after listening to a partial rehearsal of them why you couldnt fire a revolver from your front porch anywhere without bringing down a twovolumer everybody had written a book or an article or a poem or was in the process or expectation of doing it and doubtless those whose names escape me will have greater difficulty in eluding fame these kindly these gifted folk each came to see us and to make us at home among them and my home is still among them on this side and on that side of the line between the living and the dead which invisibly passes through all the streets of the cities of men     ii  we had the whole summer for the exploration of cambridge before society returned from the mountains and the seashore and it was not till october that i saw longfellow i heard again as i heard when i first came to boston that he was at nahant and though nahant was no longer so far away now as it was then i did not think of seeking him out even when we went for a day to explore that coast during the summer it seems strange that i cannot recall just when and where i saw him but early after his return to cambridge i had a message from him asking me to come to a meeting of the dante club at craigie house  longfellow was that winter 18667 revising his translation of the paradiso and the dante club was the circle of italianate friends and scholars whom he invited to follow him and criticise his work from the original while he read his version aloud those who were most constantly present were lowell and professor norton but from time to time others came in and we seldom sat down at the nineoclock supper that followed the reading of the canto in less number than ten or twelve  the criticism especially from the accomplished danteists i have named was frank and frequent i believe they neither of them quite agreed with longfellow as to the form of version he had chosen but waiving that the question was how perfectly he had done his work upon the given lines i myself with whatever right great or little i may have to an opinion believe thoroughly in longfellows plan when i read his version my sense aches for the rhyme which he rejected but my admiration for his fidelity to dante otherwise is immeasurable i remember with equal admiration the subtle and sympathetic scholarship of his critics who scrutinized every shade of meaning in a word or phrase that gave them pause and did not let it pass till all the reasons and facts had been considered sometimes and even often longfellow yielded to their censure but for the most part when he was of another mind he held to his mind and the passage had to go as he said i make a little haste to say that in all the meetings of the club during a whole winter of wednesday evenings i myself though i faithfully followed in an italian dante with the rest ventured upon one suggestion only this was kindly even seriously considered by the poet and gently rejected he could not do anything otherwise than gently and i was not suffered to feel that i had done a presumptuous thing i can see him now as he looked up from the proofsheets on the round table before him and over at me growing consciously smaller and smaller like something through a reversed operaglass he had a shaded droplight in front of him and in its glow his beautiful and benignly noble head had a dignity peculiar to him  all the portraits of longfellow are likenesses more or less bad and good for there was something as simple in the physiognomy as in the nature of the man his head after he allowed his beard to grow and wore his hair long in the manner of elderly men was leonine but mildly leonine as the old painters conceived the lion of st mark once sophocles the exmonk of mount athos so long a greek professor at harvard came in for supper after the reading was over and he was leonine too but of a fierceness that contrasted finely with longfellows mildness i remember the poets asking him something about the punishment of impaling in turkey and his answering with an ironical gleam of his fiery eyes unhappily it is obsolete i dare say he was not so leonine either as he looked  when longfellow read verse it was with a hollow with a mellow resonant murmur like the note of some deepthroated horn his voice was very lulling in quality and at the dante club it used to have early effect with an old scholar who sat in a cavernous armchair at the corner of the fire and who drowsed audibly in the soft tone and the gentle heat the poet had a fat terrier who wished always to be present at the meetings of the club and he commonly fell asleep at the same moment with that dear old scholar so that when they began to make themselves heard in concert one could not tell which it was that most took our thoughts from the text of the paradiso when the duet opened longfellow would look up with an arch recognition of the fact and then go gravely on to the end of the canto at the close he would speak to his friend and lead him out to supper as if he had not seen or heard anything amiss     iii  in that elect company i was silent partly because i was conscious of my youthful inadequacy and partly because i preferred to listen but longfellow always behaved as if i were saying a succession of edifying and delightful things and from time to time he addressed himself to me so that i should not feel left out he did not talk much himself and i recall nothing that he said but he always spoke both wisely and simply without the least touch of pose and with no intention of effect but with something that i must call quality for want of a better word so that at a table where holmes sparkled and lowell glowed and agassiz beamed he cast the light of a gentle gaiety which seemed to dim all these vivider luminaries while he spoke you did not miss fieldss story or tom appletons wit or even the gracious amity of mr norton with his unequalled intuitions  the supper was very plain a cold turkey which the host carved or a haunch of venison or some braces of grouse or a platter of quails with a deep bowl of salad and the sympathetic companionship of those elect vintages which longfellow loved and which he chose with the inspiration of affection we usually began with oysters and when some one who was expected did not come promptly longfellow invited us to raid his plate as a just punishment of his delay one evening lowell remarked with the cayenne poised above his bluepoints its astonishing how fond these fellows are of pepper  the old friend of the cavernous armchair was perhaps not wide enough awake to repress an ah of deep interest in this fact of natural history and lowell was provoked to go on yes ive dropped a red pepper pod into a barrel of them before now and then taken them out in a solid mass clinging to it like a swarm of bees to their queen  is it possible cried the old friend and then longfellow intervened to save him from worse and turned the talk  i reproach myself that i made no record of the talk for i find that only a few fragments of it have caught in my memory and that the sieve which should have kept the gold has let it wash away with the gravel i remember once doctor holmess talking of the physician as the true seer whose awful gift it was to behold with the fatal second sight of science the shroud gathering to the throat of many a doomed man apparently in perfect health and happy in the promise of unnumbered days the thought may have been suggested by some of the toys of superstition which intellectual people like to play with  i never could be quite sure at first that longfellows brotherinlaw appleton was seriously a spiritualist even when he disputed the most strenuously with the unbelieving autocrat but he really was in earnest about it though he relished a joke at the expense of his doctrine like some clerics when they are in the safe company of other clerics he told me once of having recounted to agassiz the facts of a very remarkable seance where the souls of the departed outdid themselves in the athletics and acrobatics they seem so fond of over there throwing large stones across the room moving pianos and lifting dinnertables and setting them atwirl under the chandelier and now he demanded what do you say to that well mr appleton agassiz answered to appletons infinite delight i say that it did not happen  one night they began to speak at the dante supper of the unhappy man whose crime is a red stain in the cambridge annals and one and another recalled their impressions of professor webster it was possibly with a retroactive sense that they had all felt something uncanny in him but apropos of the deep saladbowl in the centre of the table longfellow remembered a supper webster was at where he lighted some chemical in such a dish and held his head over it with a handkerchief noosed about his throat and lifted above it with one hand while his face in the pale light took on the livid ghastliness of that of a man hanged by the neck  another night the talk wandered to the visit which an english author now with god paid america at the height of a popularity long since toppled to the ground with many another he was in very good humor with our whole continent and at longfellows table he found the champagne even surprisingly fine but he said to his host who now told the story it cawnt be genuine you know  many years afterwards this author revisited our shores and i dined with him at longfellows where he was anxious to constitute himself a guest during his sojourn in our neighborhood longfellow was equally anxious that he should not do so and he took a harmless pleasure in outmanoeuvring him he seized a chance to speak with me alone and plotted to deliver him over to me without apparent unkindness when the latest horsecar should be going in to boston and begged me to walk him to harvard square and put him aboard put him aboard and dont leave him till the car starts and then watch that he doesnt get off  these instructions he accompanied with a lifting of the eyebrows and a pursing of the mouth in an anxiety not altogether burlesque he knew himself the prey of any one who chose to batten on him and his hospitality was subject to frightful abuse perhaps mr norton has somewhere told how when he asked if a certain person who had been outstaying his time was not a dreadful bore longfellow answered with angelic patience yes but then you know i have been bored so often  there was one fatal englishman whom i shared with him during the great part of a season a poor soul not without gifts but always ready for more especially if they took the form of meat and drink he had brought letters from one of the best english men alive who withdrew them too late to save his american friends from the sad consequences of welcoming him so he established himself impregnably in a boston club and came out every day to dine with longfellow in cambridge beginning with his return from nahant in october and continuing far into december that was the year of the great horsedistemper when the plague disabled the transportation in boston and cut off all intercourse between the suburb and the city on the street railways i did think longfellow pathetically lamented that when the horsecars stopped running i should have a little respite from l but he walks out  in the midst of his own suffering he was willing to advise with me concerning some poems l had offered to the atlantic monthly and after we had desperately read them together he said with inspiration i think these things are more adapted to music than the magazine and this seemed so good a notion that when l came to know their fate from me i answered confidently i think they are rather more adapted to music he calmly asked why and as this was an exigency which longfellow had not forecast for me i was caught in it without hope of escape i really do not know what i said but i know that i did not take the poems such was my literary conscience in those days i am afraid i should be weaker now     iv  the suppers of the dante club were a relaxation from the severity of their toils on criticism and i will not pretend that their tabletalk was of that seriousness which duller wits might have given themselves up to the passing stranger especially if a light or jovial person was always welcome and i never knew of the enforcement of the rule i heard of that if you came in without question on the club nights you were a guest but if you rang or knocked you could not get in  any sort of diversion was hailed and once appleton proposed that longfellow should show us his winecellar he took up the candle burning on the table for the cigars and led the way into the basement of the beautiful old colonial mansion doubly memorable as washingtons headquarters while he was in cambridge and as the home of longfellow for so many years the taper cast just the right gleams on the darkness bringing into relief the massive piers of brick and the solid walls of stone which gave the cellar the effect of a casemate in some fortress and leaving the corners and distances to a romantic gloom this basement was a work of the days when men built more heavily if not more substantially than now but i forget if i ever knew what date the winecellar was of it was well stored with precious vintages aptly cobwebbed and dusty but i could not find that it had any more charm than the shelves of a library it is the inside of bottles and of books that makes its appeal the whole place witnessed a bygone state and luxury which otherwise lingered in a dim legend or two longfellow once spoke of certain old loveletters which dropped down on the basement stairs from some place overhead and there was the fable or the fact of a subterranean passage under the street from craigie house to the old batchelder house which i relate to these letters with no authority i can allege but in craigie house dwelt the proud fair lady who was buried in the cambridge churchyard with a slave at her head and a slave at her feet          dust is in her beautiful eyes  and whether it was they that smiled or wept in their time over those loveletters i will leave the reader to say the fortunes of her tory family fell with those of their party and the last vassal ended his days a prisoner from his creditors in his own house with a weekly enlargement on sundays when the law could not reach him it is known how the place took longfellows fancy when he first came to be professor in harvard and how he was a lodger of the last mistress craigie there long before he became its owner the house is square with longfellows study where he read and wrote on the right of the door and a statelier library behind it on the left is the drawingroom with the diningroom in its rear from its square hall climbs a beautiful stairway with twisted banisters and a tall clock in their angle  the study where the dante club met and where i mostly saw longfellow was a plain pleasant room with broad panelling in white painted pine in the centre before the fireplace stood his round table laden with books papers and proofs in the farthest corner by the window was a high desk which he sometimes stood at to write in this room washington held his councils and transacted his business with all comers in the chamber overhead he slept i do not think longfellow associated the place much with him and i never heard him speak of washington in relation to it except once when he told me with peculiar relish what he called the true version of a pious story concerning the aidedecamp who blundered in upon him while he knelt in prayer the father of his country rose and rebuked the young man severely and then resumed his devotions he rebuked him said longfellow lifting his brows and making rings round the pupils of his eyes by throwing his scabbard at his head  all the front windows of craigie house look out over the open fields across the charles which is now the longfellow memorial garden the poet used to be amused with the popular superstition that he was holding this vacant ground with a view to a rise in the price of lots while all he wanted was to keep a feature of his beloved landscape unchanged lofty elms drooped at the corners of the house on the lawn billowed clumps of the lilac which formed a thick hedge along the fence there was a terrace part way down this lawn and when a whitepainted balustrade was set some fifteen years ago upon its brink it seemed always to have been there long verandas stretched on either side of the mansion and behind was an oldfashioned garden with beds primly edged with box after a design of the poets own longfellow had a ghost story of this quaint plaisance which he used to tell with an artful reserve of the catastrophe he was coming home one winter night and as he crossed the garden he was startled by a white figure swaying before him but he knew that the only way was to advance upon it he pushed boldly forward and was suddenly caught under the throatby the clothesline with a long nightgown on it  perhaps it was at the end of a long night of the dante club that i heard him tell this story the evenings were sometimes mornings before the reluctant breakup came but they were never half long enough for me i have given no idea of the high reasoning of vital things which i must often have heard at that table and that i have forgotten it is no proof that i did not hear it the memory will not be ruled as to what it shall bind and what it shall loose and i should entreat mine in vain for record of those meetings other than what i have given perhaps it would be well in the interest of some popular conceptions of what the social intercourse of great wits must be for me to invent some ennobling and elevating passages of conversation at longfellows perhaps i ought to do it for the sake of my own repute as a serious and adequate witness but i am rather helpless in the matter i must set down what i remember and surely if i can remember no phrase from holmes that a reader could live or die by it is something to recall how when a certain potent cheese was passing he leaned over to gaze at it and asked does it kick does it kick no strain of high poetic thinking remains to me from lowell but he made me laugh unforgettably with his passive adventure one night going home late when a man suddenly leaped from the top of a high fence upon the sidewalk at his feet and after giving him the worst fright of his life disappeared peaceably into the darkness to be sure there was one most memorable supper when he read the bigelow paper he had finished that day and enriched the meaning of his verse with the beauty of his voice there lingers yet in my sense his very tone in giving the last line of the passage lamenting the waste of the heroic lives which in those dark hours of johnsons time seemed to have been       butchered to make a blind mans holiday  the hush that followed upon his ceasing was of that finest quality which spoken praise always lacks and i suppose that i could not give a just notion of these dante club evenings without imparting the effect of such silences this i could not hopefully undertake to do but i am tempted to some effort of the kind by my remembrance of longfellows old friend george washington greene who often came up from his home in rhode island to be at those sessions and who was a most interesting and amiable fact of those delicate silences a full half of his earlier life had been passed in italy where he and longfellow met and loved each other in their youth with an affection which the poet was constant to in his age after many vicissitudes with the beautiful fidelity of his nature greene was like an old italian housepriest in manner gentle suave very suave smooth as creamy curds cultivated in the elegancies of literary taste and with a certain meek abeyance i think i never heard him speak in all those evenings except when longfellow addressed him though he must have had the dante scholarship for an occasional criticism it was at more recent dinners where i met him with the longfellow family alone that he broke now and then into a quotation from some of the modern italian poets he knew by heart preferably giusti and syllabled their verse with an exquisite roman accent and a bewitching florentine rhythm now and then at these times he brought out a faded italian anecdote faintly smelling of civet and threadbare in its ancient texture he liked to speak of goldoni and of nota of niccolini and manzoni of monti and leopardi and if you came to america of the revolution and his grandfather the quaker general nathaniel greene whose life he wrote and i read in three volumes he worshipped longfellow and their friendship continued while they lived but towards the last of his visits at craigie house it had a pathos for the witness which i should grieve to wrong greene was then a quivering paralytic and he clung tremulously to longfellows arm in going out to dinner where even the modern italian poets were silent upon his lips when we rose from table longfellow lifted him out of his chair and took him upon his arm again for their return to the study  he was of lighter metal than most other members of the dante club and he was not of their immediate intimacy living away from cambridge as he did and i shared his silence in their presence with full sympathy i was by far the youngest of their number and i cannot yet quite make out why i was of it at all but at every moment i was as sensible of my good fortune as of my ill desert they were the men whom of all men living i most honored and it seemed to be impossible that i at my age should be so perfectly fulfilling the dream of my life in their company often the nights were very cold and as i returned home from craigie house to the carpenters box on sacramento street a mile or two away i was as if soulborne through the air by my pride and joy while the frozen blocks of snow clinked and tinkled before my feet stumbling along the middle of the road i still think that was the richest moment of my life and i look back at it as the moment in a life not unblessed by chance which i would most like to live over againif i must live any the next winter the sessions of the dante club were transferred to the house of mr norton who was then completing his version of the vita nuova this has always seemed to me a work of not less graceful art than longfellows translation of the commedia in fact it joins the effect of a sympathy almost mounting to divination with a patient scholarship and a delicate skill unknown to me elsewhere in such work i do not know whether mr norton has satisfied himself better in his prose version of the commedia than in this of the vita nuova but i do not believe he could have satisfied dante better unless he had rhymed his sonnets and canzonets i am sure he might have done this if he had chosen he has always pretended that it was impossible but miracles are never impossible in the right hands     v  after three or four years we sold the carpenters box on sacramento street and removed to a larger house near harvard square and in the immediate neighborhood of longfellow he gave me an easement across that old garden behind his house through an opening in the high board fence which enclosed it and i saw him oftener than ever though the meetings of the dante club had come to an end at the last of them lowell had asked him with fond regret in his jest longfellow why dont you do that indian poem in forty thousand verses the demand but feebly expressed the reluctance in us all though i suspect the indian poem existed only by the challengers invention before i leave my faint and unworthy record of these great times i am tempted to mention an incident poignant with tragical associations the first night after christmas the holly and the pine wreathed about the chandelier above the suppertable took fire from the gas just as we came out from the reading and longfellow ran forward and caught the burning garlands down and bore them out no one could speak for thinking what he must be thinking of when the ineffable calamity of his home befell it curtis once told me that a little while before mrs longfellows death he was driving by craigie house with holmes who said be trembled to look at it for those who lived there had their happiness so perfect that no change of all the changes which must come to them could fail to be for the worse i did not know longfellow before that fatal time and i shall not say that his presence bore record of it except in my fancy he may always have had that look of one who had experienced the utmost harm that fate can do and henceforth could possess himself of what was left of life in peace he could never have been a man of the flowing ease that makes all comers at home some people complained of a certain gene in him and he had a reserve with strangers which never quite lost itself in the abandon of friendship as lowells did he was the most perfectly modest man i ever saw ever imagined but he had a gentle dignity which i do not believe any one the coarsest the obtusest could trespass upon in the years when i began to know him his long hair and the beautiful beard which mixed with it were of one irongray which i saw blanch to a perfect silver while that pearly tone of his complexion which appleton so admired lost itself in the wanness of age and pain when he walked he had a kind of spring in his gait as if now and again a buoyant thought lifted him from the ground it was fine to meet him coming down a cambridge street you felt that the encounter made you a part of literary history and set you apart with him for the moment from the poor and mean when he appeared in harvard square he beatified if not beautified the ugliest and vulgarest looking spot on the planet outside of new york you could meet him sometimes at the market if you were of the same provisionman as he and longfellow remained as constant to his tradespeople as to any other friends he rather liked to bring his proofs back to the printers himself and we often found ourselves together at the university press where the atlantic monthly used to be printed but outside of his own house longfellow seemed to want a fit atmosphere and i love best to think of him in his study where he wrought at his lovely art with a serenity expressed in his smooth regular and scrupulously perfect handwriting it was quite vertical and rounded with a slope neither to the right nor left and at the time i knew him first he was fond of using a soft pencil on printing paper though commonly he wrote with a quill each letter was distinct in shape and between the verses was always the exact space of half an inch i have a good many of his poems written in this fashion but whether they were the first drafts or not i cannot say very likely not towards the last he no longer sent his poems to the magazines in his own hand but they were always signed in autograph  i once asked him if he were not a great deal interrupted and he said with a faint sigh not more than was good for him he fancied if it were not for the interruptions he might overwork he was not a friend to stated exercise i believe nor fond of walking as lowell was he had not indeed the childish associations of the younger poet with the cambridge neighborhoods and i never saw him walking for pleasure except on the east veranda of his house though i was told he loved walking in his youth in this and in some other things longfellow was more european than american more latin than saxon he once said quaintly that one got a great deal of exercise in putting on and off ones overcoat and overshoes  i suppose no one who asked decently at his door was denied access to him and there must have been times when he was overrun with volunteer visitors but i never heard him complain of them he was very charitable in the immediate sort which christ seems to have meant but he had his preferences humorously owned among beggars he liked the german beggars least and the italian beggars most as having most savairfaire in fact we all loved the italians in cambridge he was pleased with the accounts i could give him of the love and honor i had known for him in italy and one day there came a letter from an italian admirer addressed to mr greatest poet longfellow which he said was the very most amusing superscription he had ever seen  it is known that the king of italy offered longfellow the cross of san lazzaro which is the italian literary decoration it came through the good offices of my old acquaintance professor messadaglia then a deputy in the italian parliament whom for some reason i cannot remember i had put in correspondence with longfellow the honor was wholly unexpected and it brought longfellow a distress which was chiefly for the gentleman who had procured him the impossible distinction he showed me the pretty collar and cross not i think without a natural pleasure in it no man was ever less a bigot in things civil or religious than he but he said firmly of course as a republican and a protestant i cant accept a decoration from a catholic prince his decision was from his conscience and i think that all americans who think duly about it will approve his decision     vi  such honors as he could fitly permit himself he did not refuse and i recall what zest he had in his election to the arcadian academy which had made him a shepherd of its roman fold with the title as he said of olimipico something but i fancy his sweetest pleasure in his vast renown came from his popular recognition everywhere few were the lands few the languages he was unknown to he showed me a version of the psalm of life in chinese apparently even the poor lost autographseeker was not denied by his universal kindness i know that he kept a store of autographs ready written on small squares of paper for all who applied by letter or in person he said it was no trouble but perhaps he was to be excused for refusing the request of a lady for fifty autographs which she wished to offer as a novel attraction to her guests at a lunch party  foreigners of all kinds thronged upon him at their pleasure apparently and with perfect impunity sometimes he got a little fun very very kindly out of their excuses and reasons and the englishman who came to see him because there were no ruins to visit in america was no fable as i can testify from the poet himself but he had no prejudice against englishmen and even at a certain time when the coarsehanded british criticism began to blame his delicate art for the universal acceptance of his verse and to try to sneer him into the rank of inferior poets he was without rancor for the clumsy misliking that he felt he could not understand rudeness he was too finely framed for that he could know it only as swedenborgs most celestial angels perceived evil as something distressful angular the illwill that seemed nearly always to go with adverse criticism made him distrust criticism and the discomfort which mistaken or blundering praise gives probably made him shy of all criticism he said that in his early life as an author he used to seek out and save all the notices of his poems but in his latter days he read only those that happened to fall in his way these he cut out and amused his leisure by putting together in scrapbooks he was reluctant to make any criticism of other poets i do not remember ever to have heard him make one and his writings show no trace of the literary dislikes or contempts which we so often mistake in ourselves for righteous judgments no doubt he had his resentments but he hushed them in his heart which he did not suffer them to embitter while poe was writing of longfellow and other plagiarists longfellow was helping to keep poe alive by the loans which always made themselves gifts in poes case he very very rarely spoke of himself at all and almost never of the grievances which he did not fail to share with all who live  he was patient as i said of all things and gentle beyond all mere gentlemanliness but it would have been a great mistake to mistake his mildness for softness it was most manly and firm and of course it was braced with the new england conscience he was born to if he did not find it well to assert himself he was prompt in behalf of his friends and one of the fine things told of him was his resenting some censures of sumner at a dinner in boston during the old proslavery times he said to the gentlemen present that sumner was his friend and he must leave their company if they continued to assail him  but he spoke almost as rarely of his friends as of himself he liked the large impersonal topics which could be dealt with on their human side and involved characters rather than individuals this was rather strange in cambridge where we were apt to take our instances from the environment it was not the only thing he was strange in there he was not to that manner born he lacked the final intimacies which can come only of birth and lifelong association and which make the men of the boston breed seem exclusive when they least feel so he was longfellow to the friends who were james and charles and wendell to one another he and hawthorne were classmates at college but i never heard him mention hawthorne i never heard him mention whittier or emerson i think his reticence about his contemporaries was largely due to his reluctance from criticism he was the finest artist of them all and if he praised he must have praised with the reservations of an honest man of younger writers he was willing enough to speak no new contributor made his mark in the magazine unnoted by him and sometimes i showed him verse in manuscript which gave me peculiar pleasure i remember his liking for the first piece that mr maurice thompson sent me and how he tasted the fresh flavor of it and inhaled its wild new fragrance he admired the skill of some of the young storytellers he praised the subtlety of one in working out an intricate character and said modestly that he could never have done that sort of thing himself it was entirely safe to invite his judgment when in doubt for he never suffered it to become aggressive or used it to urge upon me the manuscripts that must often have been urged upon him  longfellow had a house at nahant where he went every summer for more than a quarter of a century he found the slight transition change enough from cambridge and liked it perhaps because it did not take him beyond the range of the friends and strangers whose company he liked agassiz was there and appleton sumner came to sojourn with him and the tourists of all nations found him there in half an hour after they reached boston his cottage was very plain and simple but was rich in the sight of the illimitable sea and it had a luxury of rocks at the foot of its garden draped with seaweed and washed with the indefatigable tides as he grew older and feebler he ceased to go to nahant he remained the whole year round at cambridge he professed to like the summer which he said warmed him through there better than the cold spectacle of summer which had no such effect at nahant  the hospitality which was constant at either house was not merely of the worldly sort longfellow loved good cheer he tasted history and poetry in a precious wine and he liked people who were acquainted with manners and men and brought the air of capitals with them but often the man who dined with longfellow was the man who needed a dinner and from what i have seen of the sweet courtesy that governed at that board i am sure that such a man could never have felt himself the least honored guest the poets heart was open to all the homelessness of the world and i remember how once when we sat at his table and i spoke of his poem of the challenge then a new poem and said how i had been touched by the fancy of         the povertystricken millions         who challenge our wine and bread         and impeach us all as traitors         both the living and the dead  his voice sank in grave humility as he answered yes i often think of those things he had thought of them in the days of the slave when he had taken his place with the friends of the hopeless and hapless and as long as he lived he continued of the party which had freed the slave he did not often speak of politics but when the movement of some of the best republicans away from their party began he said that he could not see the wisdom of their course but this was said without censure or criticism of them and so far as i know he never permitted himself anything like denunciation of those who in any wise differed from him on a matter of yet deeper interest i do not feel authorized to speak for him but i think that as he grew older his hold upon anything like a creed weakened though he remained of the unitarian philosophy concerning christ he did not latterly go to church i believe but then very few of his circle were churchgoers once he said something very vague and uncertain concerning the doctrine of another life when i affirmed my hope of it to the effect that he wished he could be sure with the sigh that so often clothed the expression of a misgiving with him     vii  when my acquaintance with longfellow began he had written the things that made his fame and that it will probably rest upon evangeline hiawatha and the courtship of miles standish were by that time old stories but during the eighteen years that i knew him he produced the best of his minor poems the greatest of his sonnets the sweetest of his lyrics his art ripened to the last it grew richer and finer and it never knew decay he rarely read anything of his own aloud but in three or four cases he read to me poems he had just finished as if to give himself the pleasure of hearing them with the sympathetic sense of another the hexameter piece elizabeth in the third part of tales of a wayside inn was one of these and he liked my liking its rhythmical form which i believed one of the measures best adapted to the english speech and which he had used himself with so much pleasure and success  about this time he was greatly interested in the slight experiments i was beginning to make in dramatic form and he said that if he were himself a young man he should write altogether for the stage he thought the drama had a greater future with us he was pleased when a popular singer wished to produce his masque of pandora with music and he was patient when it failed of the effect hoped for it as an opera when the late lawrence barrett in the enthusiasm which was one of the fine traits of his generous character had taken my play of a counterfeit presentment and came to the boston museum with it longfellow could not apparently have been more zealous for its popular acceptance if it had been his own work he invited himself to one of the rehearsals with me and he sat with me on the stage through the four acts with a fortitude which i still wonder at and with the keenest zest for all the details of the performance no finer testimony to the love and honor which all kinds of people had for him could have been given than that shown by the actors and employees of the theatre high and low they thronged the scenery those who were not upon the stage and at the edge of every wing were faces peering round at the poet who sat unconscious of their adoration intent upon the play he was intercepted at every step in going out and made to put his name to the photographs of himself which his worshippers produced from their persons  he came to the first night of the piece and when it seemed to be finding favor with the public he leaned forward out of his line to nod and smile at the author when they had the author up it was the sweetest flattery of the applause which abused his fondness that longfellow clapped first and loudest  where once he had given his kindness he could not again withhold it and he was anxious no fact should be interpreted as withdrawal when the emperor dom pedro of brazil who was so great a lover of longfellow came to boston he asked himself out to dine with the poet who had expected to offer him some such hospitality soon after longfellow met me and as if eager to forestall a possible feeling in me said i wanted to ask you to dinner with the emperor but he not only sent word he was coming he named his fellowguests i answered that though i should probably never come so near dining with an emperor again i prized his wish to ask me much more than the chance i had missed and with this my great and good friend seemed a little consoled i believe that i do not speak too confidently of our relation he was truly the friend of all men but i had certainly the advantage of my propinquity we were near neighbors as the pleonasm has it both when i lived on berkeley street and after i had built my own house on concord avenue and i suppose he found my youthful informality convenient he always asked me to dinner when his old friend greene came to visit him and then we had an italian time together with more or less repetition in our talk of what we had said before of italian poetry and italian character one day there came a note from him saying in effect salvini is coming out to dine with me tomorrow night and i want you to come too there will be no one else but greene and myself and we will have an italian dinner  unhappily i had accepted a dinner in boston for that night and this invitation put me in great misery i must keep my engagement but how could i bear to miss meeting salvini at longfellows table on terms like these we consulted at home together and questioned whether i might not rush into boston seek out my host there possess him of the facts and frankly throw myself on his mercy then a sudden thought struck us go to longfellow and submit the case to him i went and he entered with delicate sympathy into the affair but he decided that taking the large view of it i must keep my engagement lest i should run even a remote risk of wounding my friends susceptibilities i obeyed and i had a very good time but i still feel that i missed the best time of my life and that i ought to be rewarded for my sacrifice somewhere  longfellow so rarely spoke of himself in any way that one heard from him few of those experiences of the distinguished man in contact with the undistinguished which he must have had so abundantly but he told while it was fresh in his mind an incident that happened to him one day in boston at a tobacconists where a certain brand of cigars was recommended to him as the kind longfellow smoked ah then i must have some of them and i will ask you to send me a box said longfellow and he wrote down his name and address the cigardealer read it with the smile of a worsted champion and said well i guess you had me that time at a funeral a mourner wished to open conversation and by way of suggesting a theme of common interest began youve buried i believe  sometimes people were shown by the poet through craigie house who had no knowledge of it except that it had been washingtons headquarters of course longfellow was known by sight to every one in cambridge he was daily in the streets while his health endured and as he kept no carriage he was often to be met in the horsecars which were such common ground in cambridge that they were often like small invited parties of friends when they left harvard square so that you expected the gentlemen to jump up and ask the ladies whether they would have chicken salad in civic and political matters he mingled so far as to vote regularly and he voted with his party trusting it for a general regard to the public welfare  i fancy he was somewhat shy of his fellowmen as the scholar seems always to be from the sequestered habit of his life but i think longfellow was incapable of marking any difference between himself and them i never heard from him anything that was de haut en bas when he spoke of people and in cambridge where there was a good deal of contempt for the less lettered and we liked to smile though we did not like to sneer and to analyze if we did not censure longfellow and longfellows house were free of all that whatever his feeling may have been towards other sorts and conditions of men his effect was of an entire democracy he was always the most unassuming person in any company and at some large public dinners where i saw him i found him patient of the greater attention that more public men paid themselves and one another he was not a speaker and i never saw him on his feet at dinner except once when he read a poem for whittier who was absent he disliked afterdinner speaking and made conditions for his own exemption from it     viii  once your friend longfellow was always your friend he would not think evil of you and if he knew evil of you he would be the last of all that knew it to judge you for it this may have been from the impersonal habit of his mind but i believe it was also the effect of principle for he would do what he could to arrest the delivery of judgment from others and would soften the sentences passed in his presence naturally this brought him under some condemnation with those of a severer cast and i have heard him criticised for his benevolence towards all and his constancy to some who were not quite so true to themselves perhaps but this leniency of longfellows was what constituted him great as well as good for it is not our wisdom that censures others as for his goodness i never saw a fault in him i do not mean to say that he had no faults or that there were no better men but only to give the witness of my knowledge concerning him i claim in no wise to have been his intimate such a thing was not possible in my case for quite apparent reasons and i doubt if longfellow was capable of intimacy in the sense we mostly attach to the word something more of egotism than i ever found in him must go to the making of any intimacy which did not come from the tenderest affections of his heart but as a man shows himself to those often with him and in his noted relations with other men he showed himself without blame all men that i have known besides have had some foible it often endeared them the more or some meanness or pettiness or bitterness but longfellow had none nor the suggestion of any no breath of evil ever touched his name he went in and out among his fellowmen without the reproach that follows wrong the worst thing i ever heard said of him was that he had gene and this was said by one of those difficult cambridge men who would have found gene in a celestial angel something that bjornstjerne bjornson wrote to me when he was leaving america after a winter in cambridge comes nearer suggesting longfellow than all my talk the norsemen in the days of their stormy and reluctant conversion used always to speak of christ as the white christ and bjornson said in his letter give my love to the white mr longfellow  a good many years before longfellows death he began to be sleepless and he suffered greatly he said to me once that he felt as if he were going about with his heart in a kind of mist the whole night through he would not be aware of having slept but he would add with his heavenly patience i always get a good deal of rest from lying down so long i cannot say whether these conditions persisted or how much his insomnia had to do with his breaking health three or four years before the end came we left cambridge for a house farther in the country and i saw him less frequently than before he did not allow our meetings to cease he asked me to dinner from time to time as if to keep them up but it could not be with the old frequency once he made a point of coming to see us in our cottage on the hill west of cambridge but it was with an effort not visible in the days when he could end one of his brief walks at our house on concord avenue he never came but he left our house more luminous for his having been there once he came to supper there to meet garfield an old family friend of mine in ohio and though he was suffering from a heavy cold he would not scant us in his stay i had some very bad sherry which he drank with the serenity of a martyr and i shudder to this day to think what his kindness must have cost him he told his story of the clothesline ghost and garfield matched it with the story of an umbrella ghost who sheltered a friend of his through a midnight storm but was not cheerful company to his beneficiary who passed his hand through him at one point in the effort to take his arm  after the end of four years i came to cambridge to be treated for a long sickness which had nearly been my last and when i could get about i returned the visit longfellow had not failed to pay me but i did not find him and i never saw him again in life i went into boston to finish the winter of 18812 and from time to time i heard that the poet was failing in health as soon as i felt able to bear the horsecar journey i went out to cambridge to see him i had knocked once at his door the friendly door that had so often opened to his welcome and stood with the knocker in my hand when the door was suddenly set ajar and a maid showed her face wet with tears how is mr longfellow i palpitated and with a burst of grief she answered oh the poor gentleman has just departed i turned away as if from a helpless intrusion at a deathbed  at the services held in the house before the obsequies at the cemetery i saw the poet for the last time where          dead he lay among his books  in the library behind his study death seldom fails to bring serenity to all and i will not pretend that there was a peculiar peacefulness in longfellows noble mask as i saw it then it was calm and benign as it had been in life he could not have worn a gentler aspect in going out of the world than he had always worn in it he had not to wait for death to dignify it with the peace of god all who were left of his old cambridge were present and among those who had come farther was emerson he went up to the bier and with his arms crossed on his breast and his elbows held in either hand stood with his head pathetically fallen forward looking down at the dead face those who knew how his memory was a mere blank with faint gleams of recognition capriciously coming and going in it must have felt that he was struggling to remember who it was lay there before him and for me the electly simple words confessing his failure will always be pathetic with his remembered aspect the gentleman we have just been burying he said to the friend who had come with him was a sweet and beautiful soul but i forget his name  i had the privilege and honor of looking over the unprinted poems longfellow left behind him and of helping to decide which of them should be published  there were not many of them and some of these few were quite fragmentary i gave my voice for the publication of all that had any sort of completeness for in every one there was a touch of his exquisite art the grace of his most lovely spirit we have so far had two men only who felt the claim of their gift to the very best that the most patient skill could give its utterance one was hawthorne and the other was longfellow i shall not undertake to say which was the greater artist of these two but i am sure that every one who has studied it must feel with me that the art of longfellow held out to the end with no touch of decay in it and that it equalled the art of any other poet of his time it knew when to give itself and more and more it knew when to withhold itself  what longfellows place in literature will be i shall not offer to say that is times affair not mine but i am sure that with tennyson and browning he fully shared in the expression of an age which more completely than any former age got itself said by its poets     etext editors bookmarks     angloamerican genius for ugliness    backed their credulity with their credit    candle burning on the table for the cigars    discomfort which mistaken or blundering praise    fell either below our pride or rose above our purse    literary dislikes or contempts    memory will not be ruled    shy of his fellowmen as the scholar seems always to be
