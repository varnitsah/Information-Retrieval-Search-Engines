   revolution       the present is enough for common souls     who never looking forward are indeed     mere clay wherein the footprints of their age     are petrified for ever  i received a letter the other day  it was from a man in arizona  it began dear comrade  it ended yours for the revolution  i replied to the letter and my letter began dear comrade  it ended yours for the revolution  in the united states there are 400000 men of men and women nearly 1000000 who begin their letters dear comrade and end them yours for the revolution  in germany there are 3000000 men who begin their letters dear comrade and end them yours for the revolution in france 1000000 men in austria 800000 men in belgium 300000 men in italy 250000 men in england 100000 men in switzerland 100000 men in denmark 55000 men in sweden 50000 men in holland 40000 men in spain 30000 mencomrades all and revolutionists  these are numbers which dwarf the grand armies of napoleon and xerxes but they are numbers not of conquest and maintenance of the established order but of conquest and revolution  they compose when the roll is called an army of 7000000 men who in accordance with the conditions of today are fighting with all their might for the conquest of the wealth of the world and for the complete overthrow of existing society  there has never been anything like this revolution in the history of the world  there is nothing analogous between it and the american revolution or the french revolution  it is unique colossal  other revolutions compare with it as asteroids compare with the sun  it is alone of its kind the first worldrevolution in a world whose history is replete with revolutions  and not only this for it is the first organized movement of men to become a world movement limited only by the limits of the planet  this revolution is unlike all other revolutions in many respects  it is not sporadic  it is not a flame of popular discontent arising in a day and dying down in a day  it is older than the present generation  it has a history and traditions and a martyrroll only less extensive possibly than the martyrroll of christianity  it has also a literature a myriad times more imposing scientific and scholarly than the literature of any previous revolution  they call themselves comrades these men comrades in the socialist revolution  nor is the word empty and meaningless coined of mere lip service  it knits men together as brothers as men should be knit together who stand shoulder to shoulder under the red banner of revolt this red banner by the way symbolizes the brotherhood of man and does not symbolize the incendiarism that instantly connects itself with the red banner in the affrighted bourgeois mind  the comradeship of the revolutionists is alive and warm  it passes over geographical lines transcends race prejudice and has even proved itself mightier than the fourth of july spreadeagle americanism of our forefathers  the french socialist workingmen and the german socialist workingmen forget alsace and lorraine and when war threatens pass resolutions declaring that as workingmen and comrades they have no quarrel with each other  only the other day when japan and russia sprang at each others throats the revolutionists of japan addressed the following message to the revolutionists of russia dear comradesyour government and ours have recently plunged into war to carry out their imperialistic tendencies but for us socialists there are no boundaries race country or nationality  we are comrades brothers and sisters and have no reason to fight  your enemies are not the japanese people but our militarism and socalled patriotism  patriotism and militarism are our mutual enemies  in january 1905 throughout the united states the socialists held massmeetings to express their sympathy for their struggling comrades the revolutionists of russia and more to the point to furnish the sinews of war by collecting money and cabling it to the russian leaders the fact of this call for money and the ready response and the very wording of the call make a striking and practical demonstration of the international solidarity of this worldrevolution  whatever may be the immediate results of the present revolt in russia the socialist propaganda in that country has received from it an impetus unparalleled in the history of modern class wars  the heroic battle for freedom is being fought almost exclusively by the russian workingclass under the intellectual leadership of russian socialists thus once more demonstrating the fact that the classconscious workingmen have become the vanguard of all liberating movements of modern times  here are 7000000 comrades in an organized international worldwide revolutionary movement  here is a tremendous human force  it must be reckoned with  here is power  and here is romanceromance so colossal that it seems to be beyond the ken of ordinary mortals  these revolutionists are swayed by great passion  they have a keen sense of personal right much of reverence for humanity but little reverence if any at all for the rule of the dead  they refuse to be ruled by the dead  to the bourgeois mind their unbelief in the dominant conventions of the established order is startling  they laugh to scorn the sweet ideals and dear moralities of bourgeois society  they intend to destroy bourgeois society with most of its sweet ideals and dear moralities and chiefest among these are those that group themselves under such heads as private ownership of capital survival of the fittest and patriotismeven patriotism  such an army of revolution 7000000 strong is a thing to make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider  the cry of this army is no quarter  we want all that you possess  we will be content with nothing less than all that you possess  we want in our hands the reins of power and the destiny of mankind  here are our hands  they are strong hands we are going to take your governments your palaces and all your purpled ease away from you and in that day you shall work for your bread even as the peasant in the field or the starved and runty clerk in your metropolises  here are our hands  they are strong hands  well may rulers and ruling classes pause and consider  this is revolution  and further these 7000000 men are not an army on paper their fighting strength in the field is 7000000  today they cast 7000000 votes in the civilized countries of the world  yesterday they were not so strong  tomorrow they will be still stronger  and they are fighters  they love peace  they are unafraid of war  they intend nothing less than to destroy existing capitalist society and to take possession of the whole world  if the law of the land permits they fight for this end peaceably at the ballotbox  if the law of the land does not permit and if they have force meted out to them they resort to force themselves  they meet violence with violence their hands are strong and they are unafraid  in russia for instance there is no suffrage  the government executes the revolutionists  the revolutionists kill the officers of the government  the revolutionists meet legal murder with assassination  now here arises a particularly significant phase which it would be well for the rulers to consider  let me make it concrete  i am a revolutionist  yet i am a fairly sane and normal individual  i speak and i think of these assassins in russia as my comrades  so do all the comrades in america and all the 7000000 comrades in the world  of what worth an organized international revolutionary movement if our comrades are not backed up the world over  the worth is shown by the fact that we do back up the assassinations by our comrades in russia they are not disciples of tolstoy nor are we  we are revolutionists  our comrades in russia have formed what they call the fighting organization  this fighting organization accused tried found guilty and condemned to death one sipiaguin minister of interior  on april 2 he was shot and killed in the maryinsky palace  two years later the fighting organization condemned to death and executed another minister of interior von plehve  having done so it issued a document dated july 29 1904 setting forth the counts of its indictment of von plehve and its responsibility for the assassination  now and to the point this document was sent out to the socialists of the world and by them was published everywhere in the magazines and newspapers  the point is not that the socialists of the world were unafraid to do it not that they dared to do it but that they did it as a matter of routine giving publication to what may be called an official document of the international revolutionary movement  these are high lights upon the revolutiongranted but they are also facts  and they are given to the rulers and the ruling classes not in bravado not to frighten them but for them to consider more deeply the spirit and nature of this worldrevolution  the time has come for the revolution to demand consideration  it has fastened upon every civilized country in the world  as fast as a country becomes civilized the revolution fastens upon it  with the introduction of the machine into japan socialism was introduced  socialism marched into the philippines shoulder to shoulder with the american soldiers  the echoes of the last gun had scarcely died away when socialist locals were forming in cuba and porto rico  vastly more significant is the fact that of all the countries the revolution has fastened upon on not one has it relaxed its grip  on the contrary on every country its grip closes tighter year by year  as an active movement it began obscurely over a generation ago in 1867 its voting strength in the world was 30000  by 1871 its vote had increased to 1000000  not till 1884 did it pass the halfmillion point  by 1889 it had passed the million point it had then gained momentum  in 1892 the socialist vote of the world was 1798391 in 1893 2585898 in 1895 3033718 in 1898 4515591 in 1902 5253054 in 1903 6285374 and in the year of our lord 1905 it passed the sevenmillion mark  nor has this flame of revolution left the united states untouched  in 1888 there were only 2068 socialist votes  in 1902 there were 127713 socialist votes  and in 1904 435040 socialist votes were cast  what fanned this flame  not hard times  the first four years of the twentieth century were considered prosperous years yet in that time more than 300000 men added themselves to the ranks of the revolutionists flinging their defiance in the teeth of bourgeois society and taking their stand under the bloodred banner  in the state of the writer california one man in twelve is an avowed and registered revolutionist  one thing must be clearly understood  this is no spontaneous and vague uprising of a large mass of discontented and miserable peoplea blind and instinctive recoil from hurt  on the contrary the propaganda is intellectual the movement is based upon economic necessity and is in line with social evolution while the miserable people have not yet revolted  the revolutionist is no starved and diseased slave in the shambles at the bottom of the social pit but is in the main a hearty wellfed workingman who sees the shambles waiting for him and his children and recoils from the descent  the very miserable people are too helpless to help themselves  but they are being helped and the day is not far distant when their numbers will go to swell the ranks of the revolutionists  another thing must be clearly understood  in spite of the fact that middleclass men and professional men are interested in the movement it is nevertheless a distinctly workingclass revolt  the world over it is a workingclass revolt  the workers of the world as a class are fighting the capitalists of the world as a class  the socalled great middle class is a growing anomaly in the social struggle  it is a perishing class wily statisticians to the contrary and its historic mission of buffer between the capitalist and workingclasses has just about been fulfilled  little remains for it but to wail as it passes into oblivion as it has already begun to wail in accents populistic and jeffersoniandemocratic  the fight is on  the revolution is here now and it is the worlds workers that are in revolt  naturally the question arises why is this so  no mere whim of the spirit can give rise to a worldrevolution  whim does not conduce to unanimity  there must be a deepseated cause to make 7000000 men of the one mind to make them cast off allegiance to the bourgeois gods and lose faith in so fine a thing as patriotism  there are many counts of the indictment which the revolutionists bring against the capitalist class but for present use only one need be stated and it is a count to which capital has never replied and can never reply  the capitalist class has managed society and its management has failed and not only has it failed in its management but it has failed deplorably ignobly horribly  the capitalist class had an opportunity such as was vouchsafed no previous ruling class in the history of the world  it broke away from the rule of the old feudal aristocracy and made modern society  it mastered matter organized the machinery of life and made possible a wonderful era for mankind wherein no creature should cry aloud because it had not enough to eat and wherein for every child there would be opportunity for education for intellectual and spiritual uplift  matter being mastered and the machinery of life organized all this was possible  here was the chance godgiven and the capitalist class failed  it was blind and greedy  it prattled sweet ideals and dear moralities rubbed its eyes not once nor ceased one whit in its greediness and smashed down in a failure as tremendous only as was the opportunity it had ignored  but all this is like so much cobwebs to the bourgeois mind  as it was blind in the past it is blind now and cannot see nor understand  well then let the indictment be stated more definitely in terms sharp and unmistakable  in the first place consider the caveman  he was a very simple creature  his head slanted back like an orangoutangs and he had but little more intelligence  he lived in a hostile environment the prey of all manner of fierce life  he had no inventions nor artifices his natural efficiency for foodgetting was say 1  he did not even till the soil  with his natural efficiency of 1 he fought off his carnivorous enemies and got himself food and shelter  he must have done all this else he would not have multiplied and spread over the earth and sent his progeny down generation by generation to become even you and me  the caveman with his natural efficiency of 1 got enough to eat most of the time and no caveman went hungry all the time  also he lived a healthy openair life loafed and rested himself and found plenty of time in which to exercise his imagination and invent gods  that is to say he did not have to work all his waking moments in order to get enough to eat  the child of the caveman and this is true of the children of all savage peoples had a childhood and by that is meant a happy childhood of play and development  and now how fares modern man  consider the united states the most prosperous and most enlightened country of the world  in the united states there are 10000000 people living in poverty  by poverty is meant that condition in life in which through lack of food and adequate shelter the mere standard of working efficiency cannot be maintained in the united states there are 10000000 people who have not enough to eat  in the united states because they have not enough to eat there are 10000000 people who cannot keep the ordinary 1 measure of strength in their bodies  this means that these 10000000 people are perishing are dying body and soul slowly because they have not enough to eat all over this broad prosperous enlightened land are men women and children who are living miserably  in all the great cities where they are segregated in slum ghettos by hundreds of thousands and by millions their misery becomes beastliness  no caveman ever starved as chronically as they starve ever slept as vilely as they sleep ever festered with rottenness and disease as they fester nor ever toiled as hard and for as long hours as they toil  in chicago there is a woman who toiled sixty hours per week  she was a garment worker  she sewed buttons on clothes  among the italian garment workers of chicago the average weekly wage of the dressmakers is 90 cents but they work every week in the year  the average weekly wage of the pants finishers is 131 and the average number of weeks employed in the year is 2785  the average yearly earnings of the dressmakers is 37 of the pants finishers 4241  such wages means no childhood for the children beastliness of living and starvation for all  unlike the caveman modern man cannot get food and shelter whenever he feels like working for it  modern man has first to find the work and in this he is often unsuccessful  then misery becomes acute  this acute misery is chronicled daily in the newspapers  let several of the countless instances be cited      in new york city lived a woman mary mead  she had three children     mary one year old johanna two years old alice four years old     her husband could find no work  they starved  they were evicted     from their shelter at 160 steuben street  mary mead strangled her     baby mary one year old strangled alice four years old failed to     strangle johanna two years old and then herself took poison  said     the father to the police constant poverty had driven my wife     insane  we lived at no 160 steuben street until a week ago when we     were dispossessed  i could get no work  i could not even make     enough to put food into our mouths  the babies grew ill and weak     my wife cried nearly all the time      so overwhelmed is the department of charities with tens of thousands     of applications from men out of work that it finds itself unable to     cope with the situationnew york commercial january 11 1905  in a daily paper because he cannot get work in order to get something to eat modern man advertises as follows      young man good education unable to obtain employment will sell to     physician and bacteriologist for experimental purposes all right and     title to his body  address for price box 3466 examiner      frank a mallin went to the central police station wednesday night     and asked to be locked up on a charge of vagrancy  he said he had     been conducting an unsuccessful search for work for so long that he     was sure he must be a vagrant  in any event he was so hungry he     must be fed  police judge graham sentenced him to ninety days     imprisonmentsan francisco examiner  in a room at the soto house 32 fourth street san francisco was found the body of w g robbins  he had turned on the gas  also was found his diary from which the following extracts are made

today or since yesterday noon  my head my head     goodbye all  how fares the child of modern man in this most prosperous of lands  in the city of new york 50000 children go hungry to school every morning from the same city on january 12 a press despatch was sent out over the country of a case reported by dr a e daniel of the new york infirmary for women and children  the case was that of a babe eighteen months old who earned by its labour fifty cents per week in a tenement sweatshop      on a pile of rags in a room bare of furniture and freezing cold     mrs mary gallin dead from starvation with an emaciated baby four     months old crying at her breast was found this morning at 513 myrtle     avenue brooklyn by policeman mcconnon of the flushing avenue     station  huddled together for warmth in another part of the room     were the father james gallin and three children ranging from two to     eight years of age  the children gazed at the policeman much as     ravenous animals might have done  they were famished and there was     not a vestige of food in their comfortless homenew york     journal january 2 1902  in the united states 80000 children are toiling out their lives in the textile mills alone  in the south they work twelvehour shifts  they never see the day  those on the night shift are asleep when the sun pours its life and warmth over the world while those on the day shift are at the machines before dawn and return to their miserable dens called homes after dark  many receive no more than ten cents a day there are babies who work for five and six cents a day  those who work on the night shift are often kept awake by having cold water dashed in their faces  there are children six years of age who have already to their credit eleven months work on the night shift  when they become sick and are unable to rise from their beds to go to work there are men employed to go on horseback from house to house and cajole and bully them into arising and going to work  ten per cent of them contract active consumption  all are puny wrecks distorted stunted mind and body  elbert hubbard says of the childlabourers of the southern cottonmills      i thought to lift one of the little toilers to ascertain his weight     straightaway through his thirtyfive pounds of skin and bones there     ran a tremor of fear and he struggled forward to tie a broken     thread  i attracted his attention by a touch and offered him a     silver dime  he looked at me dumbly from a face that might have     belonged to a man of sixty so furrowed tightly drawn and full of     pain it was  he did not reach for the moneyhe did not know what it     was  there were dozens of such children in this particular mill  a     physician who was with me said that they would all be dead probably     in two years and their places filled by othersthere were plenty     more  pneumonia carries off most of them  their systems are ripe     for disease and when it comes there is no reboundno response     medicine simply does not actnature is whipped beaten discouraged     and the child sinks into a stupor and dies  so fares modern man and the child of modern man in the united states most prosperous and enlightened of all countries on earth  it must be remembered that the instances given are instances only but they can be multiplied myriads of times  it must also be remembered that what is true of the united states is true of all the civilized world  such misery was not true of the caveman  then what has happened  has the hostile environment of the caveman grown more hostile for his descendants  has the cavemans natural efficiency of 1 for foodgetting and sheltergetting diminished in modern man to onehalf or onequarter  on the contrary the hostile environment of the caveman has been destroyed  for modern man it no longer exists  all carnivorous enemies the daily menace of the younger world have been killed off  many of the species of prey have become extinct  here and there in secluded portions of the world still linger a few of mans fiercer enemies  but they are far from being a menace to mankind  modern man when he wants recreation and change goes to the secluded portions of the world for a hunt  also in idle moments he wails regretfully at the passing of the big game which he knows in the not distant future will disappear from the earth  nor since the day of the caveman has mans efficiency for foodgetting and sheltergetting diminished  it has increased a thousandfold  since the day of the caveman matter has been mastered  the secrets of matter have been discovered  its laws have been formulated  wonderful artifices have been made and marvellous inventions all tending to increase tremendously mans natural efficiency of in every foodgetting sheltergetting exertion in farming mining manufacturing transportation and communication  from the caveman to the handworkers of three generations ago the increase in efficiency for food and sheltergetting has been very great but in this day by machinery the efficiency of the handworker of three generations ago has in turn been increased many times  formerly it required 200 hours of human labour to place 100 tons of ore on a railroad car  today aided by machinery but two hours of human labour is required to do the same task  the united states bureau of labour is responsible for the following table showing the comparatively recent increase in mans food and sheltergetting efficiency                          machine hours           hand hours barley 100 bushels    9                       211 corn 50 bushels        34                      228 shelled stalks husks and blades cut into fodder oats 160 bushels      28                      265 wheat 50 bushels      7

under the best conditions for organization in farming labour can produce 20 bushels of wheat for 66 cents or 1 bushel for 35 cents  this was done on a bonanza farm of 10000 acres in california and was the average cost of the whole product of the farm  mr carroll d wright says that today 4500000 men aided by machinery turn out a product that would require the labour of 40000000 men if produced by hand  professor herzog of austria says that 5000000 people with the machinery of today employed at socially useful labour would be able to supply a population of 20000000 people with all the necessaries and small luxuries of life by working 15 hours per day  this being so matter being mastered mans efficiency for food and sheltergetting being increased a thousandfold over the efficiency of the caveman then why is it that millions of modern men live more miserably than lived the caveman  this is the question the revolutionist asks and he asks it of the managing class the capitalist class  the capitalist class does not answer it  the capitalist class cannot answer it  if modern mans food and sheltergetting efficiency is a thousandfold greater than that of the caveman why then are there 10000000 people in the united states today who are not properly sheltered and properly fed  if the child of the caveman did not have to work why then today in the united states are 80000 children working out their lives in the textile factories alone  if the child of the caveman did not have to work why then today in the united states are there 1752187 childlabourers  it is a true count in the indictment  the capitalist class has mismanaged is today mismanaging  in new york city 50000 children go hungry to school and in new york city there are 1320 millionaires  the point however is not that the mass of mankind is miserable because of the wealth the capitalist class has taken to itself  far from it  the point really is that the mass of mankind is miserable not for want of the wealth taken by the capitalist class but for want of the wealth that was never created  this wealth was never created because the capitalist class managed too wastefully and irrationally  the capitalist class blind and greedy grasping madly has not only not made the best of its management but made the worst of it  it is a management prodigiously wasteful  this point cannot be emphasized too strongly  in face of the facts that modern man lives more wretchedly than the caveman and that modern mans food and sheltergetting efficiency is a thousandfold greater than the cavemans no other solution is possible than that the management is prodigiously wasteful  with the natural resources of the world the machinery already invented a rational organization of production and distribution and an equally rational elimination of waste the ablebodied workers would not have to labour more than two or three hours per day to feed everybody clothe everybody house everybody educate everybody and give a fair measure of little luxuries to everybody  there would be no more material want and wretchedness no more children toiling out their lives no more men and women and babes living like beasts and dying like beasts  not only would matter be mastered but the machine would be mastered  in such a day incentive would be finer and nobler than the incentive of today which is the incentive of the stomach  no man woman or child would be impelled to action by an empty stomach  on the contrary they would be impelled to action as a child in a spelling match is impelled to action as boys and girls at games as scientists formulating law as inventors applying law as artists and sculptors painting canvases and shaping clay as poets and statesmen serving humanity by singing and by statecraft  the spiritual intellectual and artistic uplift consequent upon such a condition of society would be tremendous  all the human world would surge upward in a mighty wave  this was the opportunity vouchsafed the capitalist class  less blindness on its part less greediness and a rational management were all that was necessary  a wonderful era was possible for the human race  but the capitalist class failed  it made a shambles of civilization  nor can the capitalist class plead not guilty  it knew of the opportunity  its wise men told of the opportunity its scholars and its scientists told it of the opportunity  all that they said is there today in the books just so much damning evidence against it  it would not listen  it was too greedy  it rose up as it rises up today shamelessly in our legislative halls and declared that profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes  it lulled its conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and dear moralities and allowed the suffering and misery of mankind to continue and to increase in short the capitalist class failed to take advantage of the opportunity  but the opportunity is still here  the capitalist class has been tried and found wanting  remains the workingclass to see what it can do with the opportunity  but the workingclass is incapable says the capitalist class  what do you know about it the workingclass replies  because you have failed is no reason that we shall fail furthermore we are going to have a try at it anyway  seven millions of us say so  and what have you to say to that  and what can the capitalist class say  grant the incapacity of the workingclass  grant that the indictment and the argument of the revolutionists are all wrong  the 7000000 revolutionists remain their existence is a fact  their belief in their capacity and in their indictment and their argument is a fact  their constant growth is a fact  their intention to destroy presentday society is a fact as is also their intention to take possession of the world with all its wealth and machinery and governments  moreover it is a fact that the workingclass is vastly larger than the capitalist class  the revolution is a revolution of the workingclass  how can the capitalist class in the minority stem this tide of revolution  what has it to offer  what does it offer  employers associations injunctions civil suits for plundering of the treasuries of the labourunions clamour and combination for the open shop bitter and shameless opposition to the eighthour day strong efforts to defeat all reform childlabour bills graft in every municipal council strong lobbies and bribery in every legislature for the purchase of capitalist legislation bayonets machineguns policemens clubs professional strikebreakers and armed pinkertonsthese are the things the capitalist class is dumping in front of the tide of revolution as though forsooth to hold it back  the capitalist class is as blind today to the menace of the revolution as it was blind in the past to its own godgiven opportunity  it cannot see how precarious is its position cannot comprehend the power and the portent of the revolution  it goes on its placid way prattling sweet ideals and dear moralities and scrambling sordidly for material benefits  no overthrown ruler or class in the past ever considered the revolution that overthrew it and so with the capitalist class of today  instead of compromising instead of lengthening its lease of life by conciliation and by removal of some of the harsher oppressions of the workingclass it antagonizes the workingclass drives the workingclass into revolution  every broken strike in recent years every legally plundered tradesunion treasury every closed shop made into an open shop has driven the members of the workingclass directly hurt over to socialism by hundreds and thousands  show a workingman that his union fails and he becomes a revolutionist  break a strike with an injunction or bankrupt a union with a civil suit and the workingmen hurt thereby listen to the siren song of the socialist and are lost for ever to the political capitalist parties  antagonism never lulled revolution and antagonism is about all the capitalist class offers  it is true it offers some few antiquated notions which were very efficacious in the past but which are no longer efficacious  fourthofjuly liberty in terms of the declaration of independence and of the french encyclopaedists is scarcely apposite today  it does not appeal to the workingman who has had his head broken by a policemans club his union treasury bankrupted by a court decision or his job taken away from him by a laboursaving invention nor does the constitution of the united states appear so glorious and constitutional to the workingman who has experienced a bullpen or been unconstitutionally deported from colorado  nor are this particular workingmans hurt feelings soothed by reading in the newspapers that both the bullpen and the deportation were preeminently just legal and constitutional  to hell then with the constitution says he and another revolutionist has been madeby the capitalist class  in short so blind is the capitalist class that it does nothing to lengthen its lease of life while it does everything to shorten it  the capitalist class offers nothing that is clean noble and alive  the revolutionists offer everything that is clean noble and alive  they offer service unselfishness sacrifice martyrdomthe things that sting awake the imagination of the people touching their hearts with the fervour that arises out of the impulse toward good and which is essentially religious in its nature  but the revolutionists blow hot and blow cold  they offer facts and statistics economics and scientific arguments  if the workingman be merely selfish the revolutionists show him mathematically demonstrate to him that his condition will be bettered by the revolution  if the workingman be the higher type moved by impulses toward right conduct if he have soul and spirit the revolutionists offer him the things of the soul and the spirit the tremendous things that cannot be measured by dollars and cents nor be held down by dollars and cents  the revolutionist cries out upon wrong and injustice and preaches righteousness  and most potent of all he sings the eternal song of human freedoma song of all lands and all tongues and all time  few members of the capitalist class see the revolution  most of them are too ignorant and many are too afraid to see it  it is the same old story of every perishing ruling class in the worlds history  fat with power and possession drunken with success and made soft by surfeit and by cessation of struggle they are like the drones clustered about the honey vats when the workerbees spring upon them to end their rotund existence  president roosevelt vaguely sees the revolution is frightened by it and recoils from seeing it  as he says above all we need to remember that any kind of class animosity in the political world is if possible even more wicked even more destructive to national welfare than sectional race or religious animosity  class animosity in the political world president roosevelt maintains is wicked  but class animosity in the political world is the preachment of the revolutionists  let the class wars in the industrial world continue they say but extend the class war to the political world as their leader eugene v debs says so far as this struggle is concerned there is no good capitalist and no bad workingman  every capitalist is your enemy and every workingman is your friend  here is class animosity in the political world with a vengeance  and here is revolution  in 1888 there were only 2000 revolutionists of this type in the united states in 1900 there were 127000 revolutionists in 1904 435000 revolutionists  wickedness of the president roosevelt definition evidently flourishes and increases in the united states quite so for it is the revolution that flourishes and increases  here and there a member of the capitalist class catches a clear glimpse of the revolution and raises a warning cry  but his class does not heed  president eliot of harvard raised such a cry  i am forced to believe there is a present danger of socialism never before so imminent in america in so dangerous a form because never before imminent in so well organized a form  the danger lies in the obtaining control of the tradesunions by the socialists  and the capitalist employers instead of giving heed to the warnings are perfecting their strikebreaking organization and combining more strongly than ever for a general assault upon that dearest of all things to the tradesunionsthe closed shop  in so far as this assault succeeds by just that much will the capitalist class shorten its lease of life  it is the old old story over again and over again  the drunken drones still cluster greedily about the honey vats  possibly one of the most amusing spectacles of today is the attitude of the american press toward the revolution  it is also a pathetic spectacle  it compels the onlooker to be aware of a distinct loss of pride in his species  dogmatic utterance from the mouth of ignorance may make gods laugh but it should make men weep  and the american editors in the general instance are so impressive about it  the old divideup menarenotbornfreeandequal propositions are enunciated gravely and sagely as things whitehot and new from the forge of human wisdom  their feeble vapourings show no more than a schoolboys comprehension of the nature of the revolution  parasites themselves on the capitalist class serving the capitalist class by moulding public opinion they too cluster drunkenly about the honey vats  of course this is true only of the large majority of american editors to say that it is true of all of them would be to cast too great obloquy upon the human race  also it would be untrue for here and there an occasional editor does see clearlyand in his case ruled by stomachincentive is usually afraid to say what he thinks about it  so far as the science and the sociology of the revolution are concerned the average editor is a generation or so behind the facts  he is intellectually slothful accepts no facts until they are accepted by the majority and prides himself upon his conservatism  he is an instinctive optimist prone to believe that what ought to be is  the revolutionist gave this up long ago and believes not that what ought to be is but what is is and that it may not be what it ought to be at all  now and then rubbing his eyes vigorously an editor catches a sudden glimpse of the revolution and breaks out in naive volubility as for instance the one who wrote the following in the chicago chronicle american socialists are revolutionists  they know that they are revolutionists  it is high time that other people should appreciate the fact  a whitehot brandnew discovery and he proceeded to shout it out from the housetops that we forsooth were revolutionists  why it is just what we have been doing all these yearsshouting it out from the housetops that we are revolutionists and stop us who can  the time should be past for the mental attitude revolution is atrocious  sir there is no revolution  likewise should the time be past for that other familiar attitude socialism is slavery  sir it will never be  it is no longer a question of dialectics theories and dreams  there is no question about it  the revolution is a fact  it is here now  seven million revolutionists organized working day and night are preaching the revolutionthat passionate gospel the brotherhood of man  not only is it a coldblooded economic propaganda but it is in essence a religious propaganda with a fervour in it of paul and christ  the capitalist class has been indicted  it has failed in its management and its management is to be taken away from it  seven million men of the workingclass say that they are going to get the rest of the workingclass to join with them and take the management away  the revolution is here now  stop it who can  sacramento river march 1905     the somnambulists       tis only fools speak evil of the clay     the very stars are made of clay like mine  the mightiest and absurdest sleepwalker on the planet  chained in the circle of his own imaginings man is only too keen to forget his origin and to shame that flesh of his that bleeds like all flesh and that is good to eat  civilization which is part of the circle of his imaginings has spread a veneer over the surface of the softshelled animal known as man  it is a very thin veneer but so wonderfully is man constituted that he squirms on his bit of achievement and believes he is garbed in armourplate  yet man today is the same man that drank from his enemys skull in the dark german forests that sacked cities and stole his women from neighbouring clans like any howling aborigine  the fleshandblood body of man has not changed in the last several thousand years  nor has his mind changed  there is no faculty of the mind of man today that did not exist in the minds of the men of long ago  man has today no concept that is too wide and deep and abstract for the mind of plato or aristotle to grasp  give to plato or aristotle the same fund of knowledge that man today has access to and plato and aristotle would reason as profoundly as the man of today and would achieve very similar conclusions  it is the same old animal man smeared over it is true with a veneer thin and magical that makes him dream drunken dreams of selfexaltation and to sneer at the flesh and the blood of him beneath the smear  the raw animal crouching within him is like the earthquake monster pent in the crust of the earth  as he persuades himself against the latter till it arouses and shakes down a city so does he persuade himself against the former until it shakes him out of his dreaming and he stands undisguised a brute like any other brute  starve him let him miss six meals and see gape through the veneer the hungry maw of the animal beneath  get between him and the female of his kind upon whom his mating instinct is bent and see his eyes blaze like an angry cats hear in his throat the scream of wild stallions and watch his fists clench like an orangoutangs  maybe he will even beat his chest  touch his silly vanity which he exalts into highsounding pridecall him a liar and behold the red animal in him that makes a hand clutching that is quick like the tensing of a tigers claw or an eagles talon incarnate with desire to rip and tear  it is not necessary to call him a liar to touch his vanity  tell a plains indian that he has failed to steal horses from the neighbouring tribe or tell a man living in bourgeois society that he has failed to pay his bills at the neighbouring grocers and the results are the same each plains indian and bourgeois is smeared with a slightly different veneer that is all  it requires a slightly different stick to scrape it off  the raw animals beneath are identical  but intrude not violently upon man leave him alone in his somnambulism and he kicks out from under his feet the ladder of life up which he has climbed constitutes himself the centre of the universe dreams sordidly about his own particular god and maunders metaphysically about his own blessed immortality  true he lives in a real world breathes real air eats real food and sleeps under real blankets in order to keep real cold away  and theres the rub  he has to effect adjustments with the real world and at the same time maintain the sublimity of his dream  the result of this admixture of the real and the unreal is confusion thrice confounded  the man that walks the real world in his sleep becomes such a tangled mass of contradictions paradoxes and lies that he has to lie to himself in order to stay asleep  in passing it may be noted that some men are remarkably constituted in this matter of selfdeception  they excel at deceiving themselves  they believe and they help others to believe  it becomes their function in society and some of them are paid large salaries for helping their fellowmen to believe for instance that they are not as other animals for helping the king to believe and his parasites and drudges as well that he is gods own manager over so many square miles of earthcrust for helping the merchant and banking classes to believe that society rests on their shoulders and that civilization would go to smash if they got out from under and ceased from their exploitations and petty pilferings  prizefighting is terrible  this is the dictum of the man who walks in his sleep  he prates about it and writes to the papers about it and worries the legislators about it  there is nothing of the brute about him  he is a sublimated soul that treads the heights and breathes refined etherin selfcomparison with the prizefighter  the man who walks in his sleep ignores the flesh and all its wonderful play of muscle joint and nerve  he feels that there is something godlike in the mysterious deeps of his being denies his relationship with the brute and proceeds to go forth into the world and express by deeds that something godlike within him  he sits at a desk and chases dollars through the weeks and months and years of his life  to him the life godlike resolves into a problem something like this since the great mass of men toil at producing wealth how best can he get between the great mass of men and the wealth they produce and get a slice for himself  with tremendous exercise of craft deceit and guile he devotes his life godlike to this purpose  as he succeeds his somnambulism grows profound  he bribes legislatures buys judges controls primaries and then goes and hires other men to tell him that it is all glorious and right  and the funniest thing about it is that this archdeceiver believes all that they tell him  he reads only the newspapers and magazines that tell him what he wants to be told listens only to the biologists who tell him that he is the finest product of the struggle for existence and herds only with his own kind where like the monkeyfolk they teeter up and down and tell one another how great they are  in the course of his life godlike he ignores the fleshuntil he gets to table  he raises his hands in horror at the thought of the brutish prizefighter and then sits down and gorges himself on roast beef rare and red running blood under every sawing thrust of the implement called a knife  he has a piece of cloth which he calls a napkin with which he wipes from his lips and from the hair on his lips the greasy juices of the meat  he is fastidiously nauseated at the thought of two prizefighters bruising each other with their fists and at the same time because it will cost him some money he will refuse to protect the machines in his factory though he is aware that the lack of such protection every year mangles batters and destroys out of all humanness thousands of workingmen women and children  he will chatter about things refined and spiritual and godlike like himself and he and the men who herd with him will calmly adulterate the commodities they put upon the market and which annually kill tens of thousands of babies and young children  he will recoil at the suggestion of the horrid spectacle of two men confronting each other with gloved hands in the roped arena and at the same time he will clamour for larger armies and larger navies for more destructive war machines which with a single discharge will disrupt and rip to pieces more human beings than have died in the whole history of prizefighting  he will bribe a city council for a franchise or a state legislature for a commercial privilege but he has never been known in all his sleepwalking history to bribe any legislative body in order to achieve any moral end such as for instance abolition of prizefighting childlabour laws pure food bills or old age pensions  ah but we do not stand for the commercial life object the refined scholarly and professional men  they are also sleepwalkers  they do not stand for the commercial life but neither do they stand against it with all their strength  they submit to it to the brutality and carnage of it  they develop classical economists who announce that the only possible way for men and women to get food and shelter is by the existing method  they produce university professors men who claim the role of teachers and who at the same time claim that the austere ideal of learning is passionless pursuit of passionless intelligence  they serve the men who lead the commercial life give to their sons somnambulistic educations preach that sleepwalking is the only way to walk and that the persons who walk otherwise are atavisms or anarchists  they paint pictures for the commercial men write books for them sing songs for them act plays for them and dose them with various drugs when their bodies have grown gross or dyspeptic from overeating and lack of exercise  then there are the good kind somnambulists who dont prizefight who dont play the commercial game who dont teach and preach somnambulism who dont do anything except live on the dividends that are coined out of the wan white fluid that runs in the veins of little children out of mothers tears the blood of strong men and the groans and sighs of the old  the receiver is as bad as the thiefay and the thief is finer than the receiver he at least has the courage to run the risk  but the good kind people who dont do anything wont believe this and the assertion will make them angryfor a moment  they possess several magic phrases which are like the incantations of a voodoo doctor driving devils away  the phrases that the good kind people repeat to themselves and to one another sound like abstinence temperance thrift virtue  sometimes they say them backward when they sound like prodigality drunkenness wastefulness and immorality  they do not really know the meaning of these phrases but they think they do and that is all that is necessary for somnambulists  the calm repetition of such phrases invariably drives away the waking devils and lulls to slumber  our statesmen sell themselves and their country for gold  our municipal servants and state legislators commit countless treasons  the world of graft  the world of betrayal  the world of somnambulism whose exalted and sensitive citizens are outraged by the knockouts of the prizering and who annually not merely knock out but kill thousands of babies and children by means of child labour and adulterated food  far better to have the front of ones face pushed in by the fist of an honest prizefighter than to have the lining of ones stomach corroded by the embalmed beef of a dishonest manufacturer  in a prizefight men are classed  a lightweight fights with a lightweight he never fights with a heavyweight and foul blows are not allowed  yet in the world of the somnambulists where soar the sublimated spirits there are no classes and foul blows are continually struck and never disallowed  only they are not called foul blows  the world of claw and fang and fist and club has passed awayso say the somnambulists  a rebate is not an elongated claw  a wall street raid is not a fang slash  dummy boards of directors and fake accountings are not foul blows of the fist under the belt  a present of coal stock by a mine operator to a railroad official is not a claw rip to the bowels of a rival mine operator  the hundred million dollars with which a combination beats down to his knees a man with a million dollars is not a club  the man who walks in his sleep says it is not a club  so say all of his kind with which he herds  they gather together and solemnly and gloatingly make and repeat certain noises that sound like discretion acumen initiative enterprise  these noises are especially gratifying when they are made backward  they mean the same things but they sound different  and in either case forward or backward the spirit of the dream is not disturbed  when a man strikes a foul blow in the prizering the fight is immediately stopped he is declared the loser and he is hissed by the audience as he leaves the ring  but when a man who walks in his sleep strikes a foul blow he is immediately declared the victor and awarded the prize and amid acclamations he forthwith turns his prize into a seat in the united states senate into a grotesque palace on fifth avenue and into endowed churches universities and libraries to say nothing of subsidized newspapers to proclaim his greatness  the red animal in the somnambulist will out  he decries the carnal combat of the prizering and compels the red animal to spiritual combat the poisoned lie the nasty gossiping tongue the brutality of the unkind epigram the business and social nastiness and treachery of todaythese are the thrusts and scratches of the red animal when the somnambulist is in charge  they are not the upper cuts and short arm jabs and jolts and slugging blows of the spirit  they are the foul blows of the spirit that have never been disbarred as the foul blows of the prizering have been disbarred  would it not be preferable for a man to strike one full on the mouth with his fist than for him to tell a lie about one or malign those that are nearest and dearest  for these are the crimes of the spirit and alas they are so much more frequent than blows on the mouth  and whosoever exalts the spirit over the flesh by his own creed avers that a crime of the spirit is vastly more terrible than a crime of the flesh  thus stand the somnambulists convicted by their own creedonly they are not real men alive and awake and they proceed to mutter magic phrases that dispel all doubt as to their undiminished and eternal gloriousness  it is well enough to let the ape and tiger die but it is hardly fair to kill off the natural and courageous apes and tigers and allow the spawn of cowardly apes and tigers to live  the prizefighting apes and tigers will die all in good time in the course of natural evolution but they will not die so long as the cowardly somnambulistic apes and tigers club and scratch and slash  this is not a brief for the prizefighter  it is a blow of the fist between the eyes of the somnambulists teetering up and down muttering magic phrases and thanking god that they are not as other animals  glen ellen california june 1900     the dignity of dollars   man is a blind helpless creature  he looks back with pride upon his goodly heritage of the ages and yet obeys unwittingly every mandate of that heritage for it is incarnate with him and in it are embedded the deepest roots of his soul  strive as he will he cannot escape itunless he be a genius one of those rare creations to whom alone is granted the privilege of doing entirely new and original things in entirely new and original ways  but the common clayborn man possessing only talents may do only what has been done before him  at the best if he work hard and cherish himself exceedingly he may duplicate any or all previous performances of his kind he may even do some of them better but there he stops the composite hand of his whole ancestry bearing heavily upon him  and again in the matter of his ideas which have been thrust upon him and which he has been busily garnering from the great world ever since the day when his eyes first focussed and he drew startled against the warm breast of his motherthe tyranny of these he cannot shake off servants of his will they at the same time master him  they may not coerce genius but they dictate and sway every action of the clayborn if he hesitate on the verge of a new departure they whip him back into the wellgreased groove if he pause bewildered at sight of some unexplored domain they rise like ubiquitous fingerposts and direct him by the village path to the communal meadow  and he permits these things and continues to permit them for he cannot help them and he is a slave out of his ideas he may weave cunning theories beautiful ideals but he is working with ropes of sand  at the slightest stress the last least bit of cohesion flits away and each idea flies apart from its fellows while all clamour that he do this thing or think this thing in the ancient and timehonoured way  he is only a clayborn so he bends his neck  he knows further that the clayborn are a pitiful pitiless majority and that he may do nothing which they do not do  it is only in some way such as this that we may understand and explain the dignity which attaches itself to dollars  in the watches of the night we may assure ourselves that there is no such dignity but jostling with our fellows in the white light of day we find that it does exist and that we ourselves measure ourselves by the dollars we happen to possess  they give us confidence and carriage and dignityay a personal dignity which goes down deeper than the garments with which we hide our nakedness  the world when it knows nothing else of him measures a man by his clothes but the man himself if he be neither a genius nor a philosopher but merely a clayborn measures himself by his pocketbook  he cannot help it and can no more fling it from him than can the bashful young man his selfconsciousness when crossing a ballroom floor  i remember once absenting myself from civilization for weary months when i returned it was to a strange city in another country  the people were but slightly removed from my own breed and they spoke the same tongue barring a certain barbarous accent which i learned was far older than the one imbibed by me with my mothers milk  a fur cap soiled and singed by many campfires half sheltered the shaggy tendrils of my uncut hair  my footgear was of walrus hide cunningly blended with seal gut the remainder of my dress was as primal and uncouth  i was a sight to give merriment to gods and men  olympus must have roared at my coming the world knowing me not could judge me by my clothes alone  but i refused to be so judged  my spiritual backbone stiffened and i held my head high looking all men in the eyes  and i did these things not that i was an egotist not that i was impervious to the critical glances of my fellows but because of a certain hogskin belt plethoric and sweatbewrinkled which buckled next the skin above the hips  oh its absurd i grant but had that belt not been so circumstanced and so situated i should have shrunk away into side streets and back alleys walking humbly and avoiding all gregarious humans except those who were likewise abroad without belts  why  i do not know save that in such way did my fathers before me  viewed in the light of sober reason the whole thing was preposterous but i walked down the gangplank with the mien of a hero of a barbarian who knew himself to be greater than the civilization he invaded  i was possessed of the arrogance of a roman governor  at last i knew what it was to be born to the purple and i took my seat in the hotel carriage as though it were my chariot about to proceed with me to the imperial palace  people discreetly dropped their eyes before my proud gaze and into their hearts i know i forced the query what manner of man can this mortal be  i was superior to convention and the very garb which otherwise would have damned me tended toward my elevation  and all this was due not to my royal lineage nor to the deeds i had done and the champions i had overthrown but to a certain hogskin belt buckled next the skin  the sweat of months was upon it toil had defaced it and it was not a creation such as would appeal to the aesthetic mind but it was plethoric  there was the arcanum each yellow grain conduced to my exaltation and the sum of these grains was the sum of my mightiness had they been less just so would have been my stature more and i should have reached the sky  and this was my royal progress through that most loyal city  i purchased a host of things from the tradespeople and bought me such pleasures and diversions as befitted one who had long been denied  i scattered my gold lavishly nor did i chaffer over prices in mart or exchange  and because of these things i did i demanded homage  nor was it refused  i moved through windswept groves of limber backs across sunny glades lighted by the beaming rays from a thousand obsequious eyes and when i tired of this basked on the greensward of popular approval  money was very good i thought and for the time was content  but there rushed upon me the words of erasmus when i get some money i shall buy me some greek books and afterwards some clothes and a great shame wrapped me around  but luckily for my souls welfare i reflected and was saved by the clearer vision vouchsafed me i beheld erasmus fireflashing heavenborn while ii was merely a clayborn a son of earth  for a giddy moment i had forgotten this and tottered  and i rolled over on my greensward caught a glimpse of a regiment of undulating backs and thanked my particular gods that such moods of madness were passing brief  but on another day receiving with kingly condescension the service of my good subjects backs i remembered the words of another man long since laid away who was by birth a nobleman by nature a philosopher and a gentleman and who by circumstance yielded up his head upon the block that a man of lead he once remarked who has no more sense than a log of wood and is as bad as he is foolish should have many wise and good men to serve him only because he has a great heap of that metal and that if by some accident or trick of law which sometimes produces as great changes as chance itself all this wealth should pass from the master to the meanest varlet of his whole family he himself would very soon become one of his servants as if he were a thing that belonged to his wealth and so was bound to follow its fortune  and when i had remembered this much i unwisely failed to pause and reflect  so i gathered my belongings together cinched my hogskin belt tight about me and went away to my own country  it was a very foolish thing to do  i am sure it was  but when i had recovered my reason i fell upon my particular gods and berated them mightily and as penance for their watchlessness placed them away amongst dust and cobwebs  oh no not for long  they are again enshrined as bright and polished as of yore and my destiny is once more in their keeping  it is given that travail and vicissitude mark time to mans footsteps as he stumbles onward toward the grave and it is well  without the bitter one may not know the sweet  the other daynay it was but yesterdayi fell before the rhythm of fortune  the inexorable pendulum had swung the counter direction and there was upon me an urgent need  the hogskin belt was flat as famine nor did it longer gird my loins  from my window i could descry at no great distance a very ordinary mortal of a man working industriously among his cabbages  i thought here am i capable of teaching him much concerning the field wherein he laboursthe nitrogenicwhy of the fertilizer the alchemy of the sun the microscopic cellstructure of the plant the cryptic chemistry of root and runnerbut thereat he straightened his workwearied back and rested his eyes wandered over what he had produced in the sweat of his brow then on to mine  and as he stood there drearily he became reproach incarnate  unstable as water he said i am sure he didunstable as water thou shalt not excel  man where are your cabbages  i shrank back  then i waxed rebellious  i refused to answer the question  he had no right to ask it and his presence was an affront upon the landscape  and a dignity entered into me and my neck was stiffened my head poised  i gathered together certain certificates of goods and chattels pointed my heel towards him and his cabbages and journeyed townward  i was yet a man  there was naught in those certificates to be ashamed of  but alackaday  while my heels thrust the cabbageman beyond the horizon my toes were drawing me faltering like a timid old beggar into a roaring spate of humanitymen women and children without end  they had no concern with me nor i with them i knew it i felt it  like she after her firebath in the womb of the world i dwindled in my own sight  my feet were uncertain and heavy and my soul became as a meal sack limp with emptiness and tied in the middle  people looked upon me scornfully pitifully reproachfully  i can swear they did  in every eye i read the question man where are your cabbages  so i avoided their looks shrinking close to the kerbstone and by furtive glances directing my progress  at last i came hard by the place and peering stealthily to the right and left that none who knew might behold me i entered hurriedly in the manner of one committing an abomination fore god  i had done no evil nor had i wronged any man nor did i contemplate evil yet was i aware of evil  why  i do not know save that there goes much dignity with dollars and being devoid of the one i was destitute of the other  the person i sought practised a profession as ancient as the oracles but far more lucrative  it is mentioned in exodus so it must have been created soon after the foundations of the world and despite the thunder of ecclesiastics and the mailed hand of kings and conquerors it has endured even to this day  nor is it unfair to presume that the accounts of this most remarkable business will not be closed until the trumps of doom are sounded and all things brought to final balance  wherefore it was in fear and trembling and with great modesty of spirit that i entered the presence  to confess that i was shocked were to do my feelings an injustice  perhaps the blame may be shouldered upon shylock fagin and their ilk but i had conceived an entirely different type of individual  this manwhy he was clean to look at his eyes were blue with the tired look of scholarly lucubrations and his skin had the normal pallor of sedentary existence  he was reading a book sober and leatherbound while on his finely moulded intellectual head reposed a black skullcap  for all the world his look and attitude were those of a college professor  my heart gave a great leap  here was hope  but no he fixed me with a cold and glittering eye searching with the chill of space till my financial status stood before him shivering and ashamed  i communed with myself by his brow he is a thinker but his intellect has been prostituted to a mercenary exaction of toll from misery  his nerve centres of judgment and will have not been employed in solving the problems of life but in maintaining his own solvency by the insolvency of others  he trades upon sorrow and draws a livelihood from misfortune he transmutes tears into treasure and from nakedness and hunger garbs himself in clean linen and develops the round of his belly  he is a bloodsucker and a vampire  he lays unholy hands on heaven and hell at cent per cent and his very existence is a sacrilege and a blasphemy and yet here am i wilting before him an arrant coward with no respect for him and less for myself  why should this shame be  let me rouse in my strength and smite him and by so doing wipe clean one offensive page  but no  as i said he fixed me with a cold and glittering eye and in it was the aristocrats undisguised contempt for the canaille  behind him was the solid phalanx of a bourgeois society  law and order upheld him while i titubated cabbageless on the ragged edge  moreover he was possessed of a formula whereby to extract juice from a flattened lemon and he would do business with me  i told him my desires humbly in quavering syllables  in return he craved my antecedents and residence pried into my private life insolently demanded how many children had i and did i live in wedlock and asked divers other unseemly and degrading questions  ay i was treated like a thief convicted before the act till i produced my certificates of goods and chattels aforementioned  never had they appeared so insignificant and paltry as then when he sniffed over them with the air of one disdainfully doing a disagreeable task  it is said thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother usury of money usury of victuals usury of anything that is lent upon usury but he evidently was not my brother for he demanded seventy per cent  i put my signature to certain indentures received my pottage and fled from his presence  faugh  i was glad to be quit of it  how good the outside air was  i only prayed that neither my best friend nor my worst enemy should ever become aware of what had just transpired  ere i had gone a block i noticed that the sun had brightened perceptibly the street become less sordid the gutter mud less filthy  in peoples eyes the cabbage question no longer brooded  and there was a spring to my body an elasticity of step as i covered the pavement  within me coursed an unwonted sap and i felt as though i were about to burst out into leaves and buds and green things  my brain was clear and refreshed  there was a new strength to my arm  my nerves were tingling and i was apulse with the times  all men were my brothers  save oneyes save one  i would go back and wreck the establishment  i would disrupt that leatherbound volume violate that black skullcap burn the accounts  but before fancy could father the act i recollected myself and all which had passed  nor did i marvel at my newhorn might at my ancient dignity which had returned  there was a tinkling chink as i ran the yellow pieces through my fingers and with the golden music rippling round me i caught a deeper insight into the mystery of things  oakland california february 1900     goliah   in 1924to be precise on the morning of january 3the city of san francisco awoke to read in one of its daily papers a curious letter which had been received by walter bassett and which had evidently been written by some crank  walter bassett was the greatest captain of industry west of the rockies and was one of the small group that controlled the nation in everything but name  as such he was the recipient of lucubrations from countless cranks but this particular lucubration was so different from the average ruck of similar letters that instead of putting it into the wastebasket he had turned it over to a reporter  it was signed goliah and the superscription gave his address as palgrave island  the letter was as follows      mr walter bassett     dear sir      i am inviting you with nine of your fellowcaptains of industry to     visit me here on my island for the purpose of considering plans for     the reconstruction of society upon a more rational basis  up to the     present social evolution has been a blind and aimless blundering     thing  the time has come for a change  man has risen from the     vitalized slime of the primeval sea to the mastery of matter but he     has not yet mastered society  man is today as much the slave to his     collective stupidity as a hundred thousand generations ago he was a     slave to matter      there are two theoretical methods whereby man may become the master     of society and make of society an intelligent and efficacious device     for the pursuit and capture of happiness and laughter  the first     theory advances the proposition that no government can be wiser or     better than the people that compose that government that reform and     development must spring from the individual that in so far as the     individuals become wiser and better by that much will their     government become wiser and better in short that the majority of     individuals must become wiser and better before their government     becomes wiser and better  the mob the political convention the     abysmal brutality and stupid ignorance of all concourses of people     give the lie to this theory  in a mob the collective intelligence     and mercy is that of the least intelligent and most brutal members     that compose the mob  on the other hand a thousand passengers will     surrender themselves to the wisdom and discretion of the captain     when their ship is in a storm on the sea  in such matter he is the     wisest and most experienced among them      the second theory advances the proposition that the majority of the     people are not pioneers that they are weighted down by the inertia     of the established that the government that is representative of     them represents only their feebleness and futility and brutishness     that this blind thing called government is not the serf of their     wills but that they are the serfs of it in short speaking always     of the great mass that they do not make government but that     government makes them and that government is and has been a stupid     and awful monster misbegotten of the glimmerings of intelligence     that come from the inertiacrushed mass      personally i incline to the second theory  also i am impatient     for a hundred thousand generations from the first social groups of     our savage forbears government has remained a monster  today the     inertiacrushed mass has less laughter in it than ever before  in     spite of mans mastery of matter human suffering and misery and     degradation mar the fair world      wherefore i have decided to step in and become captain of this     worldship for a while  i have the intelligence and the wide vision     of the skilled expert  also i have the power  i shall be obeyed     the men of all the world shall perform my bidding and make     governments so that they shall become laughterproducers  these     modelled governments i have in mind shall not make the people happy     wise and noble by decree but they shall give opportunity for the     people to become happy wise and noble      i have spoken  i have invited you and nine of your     fellowcaptains to confer with me  on march third the yacht     energon will sail from san francisco  you are requested to be on     board the night before  this is serious  the affairs of the world     must be handled for a time by a strong hand  mine is that strong     hand  if you fail to obey my summons you will die  candidly i do     not expect that you will obey  but your death for failure to obey     will cause obedience on the part of those i subsequently summon  you     will have served a purpose  and please remember that i have no     unscientific sentimentality about the value of human life  i carry     always in the background of my consciousness the innumerable billions     of lives that are to laugh and be happy in future aeons on the earth      yours for the reconstruction of society                                                                   goliah  the publication of this letter did not cause even local amusement  men might have smiled to themselves as they read it but it was so palpably the handiwork of a crank that it did not merit discussion  interest did not arouse till next morning  an associated press despatch to the eastern states followed by interviews by eagernosed reporters had brought out the names of the other nine captains of industry who had received similar letters but who had not thought the matter of sufficient importance to be made public  but the interest aroused was mild and it would have died out quickly had not gabberton cartooned a chronic presidential aspirant as goliah  then came the song that was sung hilariously from sea to sea with the refrain goliah will catch you if you dont watch out  the weeks passed and the incident was forgotten  walter bassett had forgotten it likewise but on the evening of february 22 he was called to the telephone by the collector of the port  i just wanted to tell you said the latter that the yacht energon has arrived and gone to anchor in the stream off pier seven  what happened that night walter bassett has never divulged  but it is known that he rode down in his auto to the water front chartered one of crowleys launches and was put aboard the strange yacht  it is further known that when he returned to the shore three hours later he immediately despatched a sheaf of telegrams to his nine fellowcaptains of industry who had received letters from goliah  these telegrams were similarly worded and read the yacht energon has arrived  there is something in this  i advise you to come  bassett was laughed at for his pains  it was a huge laugh that went up for his telegrams had been made public and the popular song on goliah revived and became more popular than ever  goliah and bassett were cartooned and lampooned unmercifully the former as the old man of the sea riding on the latters neck  the laugh tittered and rippled through clubs and social circles was restrainedly merry in the editorial columns and broke out in loud guffaws in the comic weeklies  there was a serious side as well and bassetts sanity was gravely questioned by many and especially by his business associates  bassett had ever been a shorttempered man and after he sent the second sheaf of telegrams to his brother captains and had been laughed at again he remained silent  in this second sheaf he had said come i implore you  as you value your life come  he arranged all his business affairs for an absence and on the night of march 2 went on board the energon  the latter properly cleared sailed next morning and next morning the newsboys in every city and town were crying extra  in the slang of the day goliah had delivered the goods  the nine captains of industry who had failed to accept his invitation were dead a sort of violent disintegration of the tissues was the report of the various autopsies held on the bodies of the slain millionaires yet the surgeons and physicians the most highly skilled in the land had participated would not venture the opinion that the men had been slain much less would they venture the conclusion at the hands of parties unknown  it was all too mysterious  they were stunned  their scientific credulity broke down  they had no warrant in the whole domain of science for believing that an anonymous person on palgrave island had murdered the poor gentlemen  one thing was quickly learned however namely that palgrave island was no myth  it was charted and well known to all navigators lying on the line of 160 west longitude right at its intersection by the tenth parallel north latitude and only a few miles away from diana shoal like midway and fanning palgrave island was isolated volcanic and coral in formation  furthermore it was uninhabited  a survey ship in 1887 had visited the place and reported the existence of several springs and of a good harbour that was very dangerous of approach  and that was all that was known of the tiny speck of land that was soon to have focussed on it the awed attention of the world  goliah remained silent till march 24  on the morning of that day the newspapers published his second letter copies of which had been received by the ten chief politicians of the united statesten leading men in the political world who were conventionally known as statesmen  the letter with the same superscription as before was as follows      dear sir      i have spoken in no uncertain tone  i must be obeyed  you may     consider this an invitation or a summons but if you still wish to     tread this earth and laugh you will be aboard the yacht energon     in san francisco harbour not later than the evening of april 5  it     is my wish and my will that you confer with me here on palgrave     island in the matter of reconstructing society upon some rational     basis      do not misunderstand me when i tell you that i am one with a     theory  i want to see that theory work and therefore i call upon     your cooperation  in this theory of mine lives are but pawns i     deal with quantities of lives  i am after laughter and those that     stand in the way of laughter must perish  the game is big  there     are fifteen hundred million human lives today on the planet  what     is your single life against them  it is as naught in my theory     and remember that mine is the power  remember that i am a scientist     and that one life or one million of lives mean nothing to me as     arrayed against the countless billions of billions of the lives of     the generations to come  it is for their laughter that i seek to     reconstruct society now and against them your own meagre little life     is a paltry thing indeed      whoso has power can command his fellows  by virtue of that military     device known as the phalanx alexander conquered his bit of the     world  by virtue of that chemical device gunpowder cortes with his     several hundred cutthroats conquered the empire of the montezumas     now i am in possession of a device that is all my own  in the course     of a century not more than half a dozen fundamental discoveries or     inventions are made  i have made such an invention  the possession     of it gives me the mastery of the world  i shall use this invention     not for commercial exploitation but for the good of humanity  for     that purpose i want helpwilling agents obedient hands and i am     strong enough to compel the service  i am taking the shortest way     though i am in no hurry  i shall not clutter my speed with haste      the incentive of material gain developed man from the savage to the     semibarbarian he is today  this incentive has been a useful device     for the development of the human but it has now fulfilled its     function and is ready to be cast aside into the scrapheap of     rudimentary vestiges such as gills in the throat and belief in the     divine right of kings  of course you do not think so but i do not     see that that will prevent you from aiding me to fling the     anachronism into the scrapheap  for i tell you now that the time     has come when mere food and shelter and similar sordid things shall     be automatic as free and easy and involuntary of access as the air     i shall make them automatic what of my discovery and the power that     discovery gives me  and with food and shelter automatic the     incentive of material gain passes away from the world for ever  with     food and shelter automatic the higher incentives will universally     obtainthe spiritual aesthetic and intellectual incentives that     will tend to develop and make beautiful and noble body mind and     spirit  then all the world will be dominated by happiness and     laughter  it will be the reign of universal laughter      yours for that day                                                                   goliah  still the world would not believe  the ten politicians were at washington so that they did not have the opportunity of being convinced that bassett had had and not one of them took the trouble to journey out to san francisco to make the opportunity  as for goliah he was hailed by the newspapers as another tom lawson with a panacea and there were specialists in mental disease who by analysis of goliahs letters proved conclusively that he was a lunatic  the yacht energon arrived in the harbour of san francisco on the afternoon of april 5 and bassett came ashore  but the energon did not sail next day for not one of the ten summoned politicians had elected to make the journey to palgrave island  the newsboys however called extra that day in all the cities  the ten politicians were dead  the yacht lying peacefully at anchor in the harbour became the centre of excited interest  she was surrounded by a flotilla of launches and rowboats and many tugs and steamboats ran excursions to her  while the rabble was firmly kept off the proper authorities and even reporters were permitted to board her  the mayor of san francisco and the chief of police reported that nothing suspicious was to be seen upon her and the port authorities announced that her papers were correct and in order in every detail  many photographs and columns of descriptive matter were run in the newspapers  the crew was reported to be composed principally of scandinaviansfairhaired blueeyed swedes norwegians afflicted with the temperamental melancholy of their race stolid russian finns and a slight sprinkling of americans and english  it was noted that there was nothing mercurial and flyaway about them  they seemed weighty men oppressed by a sad and stolid bovinesort of integrity  a sober seriousness and enormous certitude characterized all of them  they appeared men without nerves and without fear as though upheld by some overwhelming power or carried in the hollow of some superhuman hand  the captain a sadeyed strongfeatured american was cartooned in the papers as gloomy gus the pessimistic hero of the comic supplement  some seacaptain recognized the energon as the yacht scud once owned by merrivale of the new york yacht club  with this clue it was soon ascertained that the scud had disappeared several years before  the agent who sold her reported the purchaser to be merely another agent a man he had seen neither before nor since  the yacht had been reconstructed at duffeys shipyard in new jersey  the change in her name and registry occurred at that time and had been legally executed  then the energon had disappeared in the shroud of mystery  in the meantime bassett was going crazyat least his friends and business associates said so  he kept away from his vast business enterprises and said that he must hold his hands until the other masters of the world could join with him in the reconstruction of societyproof indubitable that goliahs bee had entered his bonnet  to reporters he had little to say  he was not at liberty he said to relate what he had seen on palgrave island but he could assure them that the matter was serious the most serious thing that had ever happened  his final word was that the world was on the verge of a turnover for good or ill he did not know but one way or the other he was absolutely convinced that the turnover was coming  as for business business could go hang  he had seen things he had and that was all there was to it  there was a great telegraphing during this period between the local federal officials and the state and war departments at washington  a secret attempt was made late one afternoon to board the energon and place the captain under arrestthe attorneygeneral having given the opinion that the captain could be held for the murder of the ten statesmen  the government launch was seen to leave meiggs wharf and steer for the energon and that was the last ever seen of the launch and the men on board of it  the government tried to keep the affair hushed up but the cat was slipped out of the bag by the families of the missing men and the papers were filled with monstrous versions of the affair  the government now proceeded to extreme measures  the battleship alaska was ordered to capture the strange yacht or failing that to sink her  these were secret instructions but thousands of eyes from the water front and from the shipping in the harbour witnessed what happened that afternoon  the battleship got under way and steamed slowly toward the energon  at half a mile distant the battleship blew upsimply blew up that was all her shattered frame sinking to the bottom of the bay a riffraff of wreckage and a few survivors strewing the surface  among the survivors was a young lieutenant who had had charge of the wireless on board the alaska  the reporters got hold of him first and he talked  no sooner had the alaska got under way he said than a message was received from the energon  it was in the international code and it was a warning to the alaska to come no nearer than half a mile  he had sent the message through the speaking tube immediately to the captain  he did not know anything more except that the energon twice repeated the message and that five minutes afterward the explosion occurred  the captain of the alaska had perished with his ship and nothing more was to be learned  the energon however promptly hoisted anchor and cleared out to sea a great clamour was raised by the papers the government was charged with cowardice and vacillation in its dealings with a mere pleasure yacht and a lunatic who called himself goliah and immediate and decisive action was demanded  also a great cry went up about the loss of life especially the wanton killing of the ten statesmen  goliah promptly replied  in fact so prompt was his reply that the experts in wireless telegraphy announced that since it was impossible to send wireless messages so great a distance goliah was in their very midst and not on palgrave island  goliahs letter was delivered to the associated press by a messenger boy who had been engaged on the street  the letter was as follows      what are a few paltry lives  in your insane wars you destroy     millions of lives and think nothing of it  in your fratricidal     commercial struggle you kill countless babes women and men and you     triumphantly call the shambles individualism  i call it anarchy     i am going to put a stop to your wholesale destruction of human     beings  i want laughter not slaughter  those of you who stand in     the way of laughter will get slaughter      your government is trying to delude you into believing that the     destruction of the alaska was an accident  know here and now that     it was by my orders that the alaska was destroyed  in a few short     months all battleships on all seas will be destroyed or flung to the     scrapheap and all nations shall disarm fortresses shall be     dismantled armies disbanded and warfare shall cease from the earth     mine is the power  i am the will of god  the whole world shall be     in vassalage to me but it shall be a vassalage of peace                                                                       i am                                                                  goliah  blow palgrave island out of the water was the headline retort of the newspapers  the government was of the same frame of mind and the assembling of the fleets began  walter bassett broke out in ineffectual protest but was swiftly silenced by the threat of a lunacy commission goliah remained silent  against palgrave island five great fleets were hurledthe asiatic squadron the south pacific squadron the north pacific squadron the caribbean squadron and half of the north atlantic squadron the two latter coming through the panama canal  i have the honour to report that we sighted palgrave island on the evening of april 29 ran the report of captain johnson of the battleship north dakota to the secretary of the navy  the asiatic squadron was delayed and did not arrive until the morning of april 30  a council of the admirals was held and it was decided to attack early next morning  the destroyer swift vii crept in unmolested and reported no warlike preparations on the island  it noted several small merchant steamers in the harbour and the existence of a small village in a hopelessly exposed position that could be swept by our fire  it had been decided that all the vessels should rush in scattered upon the island opening fire at three miles and continuing to the edge of the reef there to retain loose formation and engage  palgrave island repeatedly warned us by wireless in the international code to keep outside the tenmile limit but no heed was paid to the warnings  the north dakota did not take part in the movement of the morning of may 1  this was due to a slight accident of the preceding night that temporarily disabled her steeringgear  the morning of may 1 broke clear and calm  there was a slight breeze from the southwest that quickly died away  the north dakota lay twelve miles off the island  at the signal the squadrons charged in upon the island from all sides at full speed  our wireless receiver continued to tick off warnings from the island  the tenmile limit was passed and nothing happened  i watched through my glasses  at five miles nothing happened at four miles nothing happened at three miles the new york in the lead on our side of the island opened fire  she fired only one shot  then she blew up the rest of the vessels never fired a shot  they began to blow up everywhere before our eyes  several swerved about and started back but they failed to escape  the destroyer dart xxx nearly made the tenmile limit when she blew up  she was the last survivor  no harm came to the north dakota and that night the steeringgear being repaired i gave orders to sail for san francisco  to say that the united states was stunned is but to expose the inadequacy of language  the whole world was stunned  it confronted that blight of the human brain the unprecedented  human endeavour was a jest a monstrous futility when a lunatic on a lonely island who owned a yacht and an exposed village could destroy five of the proudest fleets of christendom  and how had he done it  nobody knew  the scientists lay down in the dust of the common road and wailed and gibbered  they did not know  military experts committed suicide by scores  the mighty fabric of warfare they had fashioned was a gossamer veil rent asunder by a miserable lunatic  it was too much for their sanity  mere human reason could not withstand the shock  as the savage is crushed by the sleightofhand of the witch doctor so was the world crushed by the magic of goliah  how did he do it  it was the awful face of the unknown upon which the world gazed and by which it was frightened out of the memory of its proudest achievements  but all the world was not stunned  there was the invariable exceptionthe island empire of japan  drunken with the wine of success deepquaffed without superstition and without faith in aught but its own ascendant star laughing at the wreckage of science and mad with pride of race it went forth upon the way of war  americas fleets had been destroyed  from the battlements of heaven the multitudinous ancestral shades of japan leaned down  the opportunity godgiven had come  the mikado was in truth a brother to the gods  the warmonsters of japan were loosed in mighty fleets  the philippines were gathered in as a child gathers a nosegay  it took longer for the battleships to travel to hawaii to panama and to the pacific coast the united states was panicstricken and there arose the powerful party of dishonourable peace  in the midst of the clamour the energon arrived in san francisco bay and goliah spoke once more  there was a little brush as the energon came in and a few explosions of magazines occurred along the wartunnelled hills as the coast defences went to smash  also the blowing up of the submarine mines in the golden gate made a remarkably fine display  goliahs message to the people of san francisco dated as usual from palgrave island was published in the papers  it ran      peace  peace be with you  you shall have peace  i have spoken to     this purpose before  and give you me peace  leave my yacht     energon alone  commit one overt act against her and not one stone     in san francisco shall stand upon another      tomorrow let all good citizens go out upon the hills that slope     down to the sea  go with music and laughter and garlands  make     festival for the new age that is dawning  be like children upon your     hills and witness the passing of war  do not miss the opportunity     it is your last chance to behold what henceforth you will be     compelled to seek in museums of antiquities                                                 i promise you a merry day                                                                  goliah  the madness of magic was in the air  with the people it was as if all their gods had crashed and the heavens still stood  order and law had passed away from the universe but the sun still shone the wind still blew the flowers still bloomedthat was the amazing thing about it that water should continue to run downhill was a miracle  all the stabilities of the human mind and human achievement were crumbling  the one stable thing that remained was goliah a madman on an island  and so it was that the whole population of san francisco went forth next day in colossal frolic upon the hills that overlooked the sea  brass bands and banners went forth brewery wagons and sundayschool picnicsall the strange heterogeneous groupings of swarming metropolitan life  on the searim rose the smoke from the funnels of a hundred hostile vessels of war all converging upon the helpless undefended golden gate and not all undefended for out through the golden gate moved the energon a tiny toy of white rolling like a straw in the stiff sea on the bar where a strong ebbtide ran in the teeth of the summer seabreeze  but the japanese were cautious  their thirty and fortythousandton battleships slowed down half a dozen miles offshore and manoeuvred in ponderous evolutions while tiny scoutboats lean sixfunnelled destroyers ran in cutting blackly the flashing sea like so many sharks  but compared with the energon they were leviathans compared with them the energon was as the sword of the archangel michael and they the forerunners of the hosts of hell  but the flashing of the sword the good people of san francisco gathered on her hills never saw  mysterious invisible it cleaved the air and smote the mightiest blows of combat the world had ever witnessed  the good people of san francisco saw little and understood less  they saw only a million and a half tons of brinecleaving thunderflinging fabrics hurled skyward and smashed back in ruin to sink into the sea  it was all over in five minutes  remained upon the wide expanse of sea only the energon rolling white and toylike on the bar  goliah spoke to the mikado and the elder statesmen  it was only an ordinary cable message despatched from san francisco by the captain of the energon but it was of sufficient moment to cause the immediate withdrawal of japan from the philippines and of her surviving fleets from the sea  japan the sceptical was converted  she had felt the weight of goliahs arm  and meekly she obeyed when goliah commanded her to dismantle her war vessels and to turn the metal into useful appliances for the arts of peace  in all the ports navyyards machineshops and foundries of japan tens of thousands of brownskinned artisans converted the warmonsters into myriads of useful things such as ploughshares goliah insisted on ploughshares gasolene engines bridgetrusses telephone and telegraph wires steel rails locomotives and rolling stock for railways  it was a worldpenance for a world to see and paltry indeed it made appear that earlier penance barefooted in the snow of an emperor to a pope for daring to squabble over temporal power  goliahs next summons was to the ten leading scientists of the united states  this time there was no hesitancy in obeying  the savants were ludicrously prompt some of them waiting in san francisco for weeks so as not to miss the scheduled sailingdate  they departed on the energon on june 15 and while they were on the sea on the way to palgrave island goliah performed another spectacular feat  germany and france were preparing to fly at each others throats  goliah commanded peace they ignored the command tacitly agreeing to fight it out on land where it seemed safer for the belligerently inclined  goliah set the date of june 19 for the cessation of hostile preparations  both countries mobilized their armies on june 18 and hurled them at the common frontier  and on june 19 goliah struck  all generals warsecretaries and jingoleaders in the two countries died on that day and that day two vast armies undirected like strayed sheep walked over each others frontiers and fraternized  but the great german war lord had escapedit was learned afterward by hiding in the huge safe where were stored the secret archives of his empire  and when he emerged he was a very penitent war lord and like the mikado of japan he was set to work beating his swordblades into ploughshares and pruninghooks  but in the escape of the german emperor was discovered a great significance  the scientists of the world plucked up courage got back their nerve  one thing was conclusively evidentgoliahs power was not magic  law still reigned in the universe  goliahs power had limitations else had the german emperor not escaped by secretly hiding in a steel safe  many learned articles on the subject appeared in the magazines  the ten scientists arrived back from palgrave island on july 6  heavy platoons of police protected them from the reporters  no they had not see goliah they said in the one official interview that was vouchsafed but they had talked with him and they had seen things  they were not permitted to state definitely all that they had seen and heard but they could say that the world was about to be revolutionized  goliah was in the possession of a tremendous discovery that placed all the world at his mercy and it was a good thing for the world that goliah was merciful the ten scientists proceeded directly to washington on a special train where for days they were closeted with the heads of government while the nation hung breathless on the outcome  but the outcome was a long time in arriving  from washington the president issued commands to the masters and leading figures of the nation  everything was secret  day by day deputations of bankers railway lords captains of industry and supreme court justices arrived and when they arrived they remained  the weeks dragged on and then on august 25 began the famous issuance of proclamations  congress and the senate cooperated with the president in this while the supreme court justices gave their sanction and the money lords and the captains of industry agreed  war was declared upon the capitalist masters of the nation  martial law was declared over the whole united states  the supreme power was vested in the president  in one day childlabour in the whole country was abolished  it was done by decree and the united states was prepared with its army to enforce its decrees  in the same day all women factory workers were dismissed to their homes and all the sweatshops were closed  but we cannot make profits wailed the petty capitalists  fools was the retort of goliah  as if the meaning of life were profits  give up your businesses and your profitmongering  but there is nobody to buy our business they wailed  buy and sellis that all the meaning life has for you replied goliah  you have nothing to sell  turn over your little cutthroating anarchistic businesses to the government so that they may be rationally organized and operated  and the next day by decree the government began taking possession of all factories shops mines ships railroads and producing lands  the nationalization of the means of production and distribution went on apace  here and there were sceptical capitalists of moment  they were made prisoners and haled to palgrave island and when they returned they always acquiesced in what the government was doing  a little later the journey to palgrave island became unnecessary  when objection was made the reply of the officials was goliah has spokenwhich was another way of saying he must be obeyed  the captains of industry became heads of departments  it was found that civil engineers for instance worked just as well in government employ as before they had worked in private employ  it was found that men of high executive ability could not violate their nature  they could not escape exercising their executive ability any more than a crab could escape crawling or a bird could escape flying  and so it was that all the splendid force of the men who had previously worked for themselves was now put to work for the good of society  the halfdozen great railway chiefs cooperated in the organizing of a national system of railways that was amazingly efficacious  never again was there such a thing as a car shortage  these chiefs were not the wall street railway magnates but they were the men who formerly had done the real work while in the employ of the wall street magnates  wall street was dead  there was no more buying and selling and speculating  nobody had anything to buy or sell  there was nothing in which to speculate  put the stock gamblers to work said goliah give those that are young and that so desire a chance to learn useful trades  put the drummers and salesmen and advertising agents and real estate agents to work said goliah and by hundreds of thousands the erstwhile useless middlemen and parasites went into useful occupations  the four hundred thousand idle gentlemen of the country who had lived upon incomes were likewise put to work  then there were a lot of helpless men in high places who were cleared out the remarkable thing about this being that they were cleared out by their own fellows  of this class were the professional politicians whose wisdom and power consisted of manipulating machine politics and of grafting  there was no longer any graft  since there were no private interests to purchase special privileges no bribes were offered to legislators and legislators for the first time legislated for the people  the result was that men who were efficient not in corruption but in direction found their way into the legislatures  with this rational organization of society amazing results were brought about  the national days work was eight hours and yet production increased  in spite of the great permanent improvements and of the immense amount of energy consumed in systematizing the competitive chaos of society production doubled and tripled upon itself  the standard of living increased and still consumption could not keep up with production  the maximum working age was decreased to fifty years to fortynine years and to fortyeight years  the minimum working age went up from sixteen years to eighteen years  the eighthour day became a sevenhour day and in a few months the national working day was reduced to five hours  in the meantime glimmerings were being caught not of the identity of goliah but of how he had worked and prepared for his assuming control of the world  little things leaked out clues were followed up apparently unrelated things were pieced together  strange stories of blacks stolen from africa were remembered of chinese and japanese contract coolies who had mysteriously disappeared of lonely south sea islands raided and their inhabitants carried away stories of yachts and merchant steamers mysteriously purchased that had disappeared and the descriptions of which remotely tallied with the crafts that had carried the orientals and africans and islanders away  where had goliah got the sinews of war was the question  and the surmised answer was by exploiting these stolen labourers  it was they that lived in the exposed village on palgrave island  it was the product of their toil that had purchased the yachts and merchant steamers and enabled goliahs agents to permeate society and carry out his will  and what was the product of their toil that had given goliah the wealth necessary to realize his plans  commercial radium the newspapers proclaimed and radiyte and radiosole and argatium and argyte and the mysterious golyte that had proved so valuable in metallurgy  these were the new compounds discovered in the first decade of the twentieth century the commercial and scientific use of which had become so enormous in the second decade  the line of fruit boats that ran from hawaii to san francisco was declared to be the property of goliah  this was a surmise for no other owner could be discovered and the agents who handled the shipments of the fruit boats were only agents  since no one else owned the fruit boats then goliah must own them  the point of which is that it leaked out that the major portion of the worlds supply in these precious compounds was brought to san francisco by those very fruit boats  that the whole chain of surmise was correct was proved in later years when goliahs slaves were liberated and honourably pensioned by the international government of the world  it was at that time that the seal of secrecy was lifted from the lips of his agents and higher emissaries and those that chose revealed much of the mystery of goliahs organization and methods  his destroying angels however remained for ever dumb  who the men were who went forth to the high places and killed at his bidding will be unknown to the end of timefor kill they did by means of that very subtle and thenmysterious force that goliah had discovered and named energon  but at that time energon the little giant that was destined to do the work of the world was unknown and undreamed of  only goliah knew and he kept his secret well  even his agents who were armed with it and who in the case of the yacht energon destroyed a mighty fleet of warships by exploding their magazines knew not what the subtle and potent force was nor how it was manufactured  they knew only one of its many uses and in that one use they had been instructed by goliah  it is now well known that radium and radiyte and radiosole and all the other compounds were byproducts of the manufacture of energon by goliah from the sunlight but at that time nobody knew what energon was and goliah continued to awe and rule the world  one of the uses of energon was in wireless telegraphy  it was by its means that goliah was able to communicate with his agents all over the world  at that time the apparatus required by an agent was so clumsy that it could not be packed in anything less than a fairsized steamer trunk  today thanks to the improvements of hendsoll the perfected apparatus can be carried in a coat pocket  it was in december 1924 that goliah sent out his famous christmas letter part of the text of which is here given      so far while i have kept the rest of the nations from each others     throats i have devoted myself particularly to the united states     now i have not given to the people of the united states a rational     social organization  what i have done has been to compel them to     make that organization themselves  there is more laughter in the     united states these days and there is more sense  food and shelter     are no longer obtained by the anarchistic methods of socalled     individualism but are now wellnigh automatic  and the beauty of it     is that the people of the united states have achieved all this for     themselves  i did not achieve it for them  i repeat they achieved     it for themselves  all that i did was to put the fear of death in     the hearts of the few that sat in the high places and obstructed the     coming of rationality and laughter  the fear of death made those in     the high places get out of the way that was all and gave the     intelligence of man a chance to realize itself socially      in the year that is to come i shall devote myself to the rest of the     world  i shall put the fear of death in the hearts of all that sit     in the high places in all the nations  and they will do as they have     done in the united statesget down out of the high places and give     the intelligence of man a chance for social rationality  all the     nations shall tread the path the united states is now on      and when all the nations are well along on that path i shall have     something else for them  but first they must travel that path for     themselves  they must demonstrate that the intelligence of mankind     today with the mechanical energy now at its disposal is capable of     organizing society so that food and shelter be made automatic labour     be reduced to a threehour day and joy and laughter be made     universal  and when that is accomplished not by me but by the     intelligence of mankind then i shall make a present to the world of     a new mechanical energy  this is my discovery  this energon is     nothing more nor less than the cosmic energy that resides in the     solar rays  when it is harnessed by mankind it will do the work of     the world  there will be no more multitudes of miners slaving out     their lives in the bowels of the earth no more sooty firemen and     greasy engineers  all may dress in white if they so will  the work     of life will have become play and young and old will be the children     of joy and the business of living will become joy and they will     compete one with another in achieving ethical concepts and     spiritual heights in fashioning pictures and songs and stories in     statecraft and beauty craft in the sweat and the endeavour of the     wrestler and the runner and the player of gamesall will compete     not for sordid coin and base material reward but for the joy that     shall be theirs in the development and vigour of flesh and in the     development and keenness of spirit  all will be joysmiths and     their task shall be to beat out laughter from the ringing anvil of     life      and now one word for the immediate future  on new years day all     nations shall disarm all fortresses and warships shall be     dismantled and all armies shall be disbanded                                                                   goliah  on new years day all the world disarmed  the millions of soldiers and sailors and workmen in the standing armies in the navies and in the countless arsenals machineshops and factories for the manufacture of war machinery were dismissed to their homes  these many millions of men as well as their costly war machinery had hitherto been supported on the back of labour  they now went into useful occupations and the released labour giant heaved a mighty sigh of relief  the policing of the world was left to the peace officers and was purely social whereas war had been distinctly antisocial  ninety per cent of the crimes against society had been crimes against private property  with the passing of private property at least in the means of production and with the organization of industry that gave every man a chance the crimes against private property practically ceased  the police forces everywhere were reduced repeatedly and again and again  nearly all occasional and habitual criminals ceased voluntarily from their depredations  there was no longer any need for them to commit crime  they merely changed with changing conditions  a smaller number of criminals was put into hospitals and cured  and the remnant of the hopelessly criminal and degenerate was segregated  and the courts in all countries were likewise decreased in number again and again  ninetyfive per cent of all civil cases had been squabbles over property conflicts of propertyrights lawsuits contests of wills breaches of contract bankruptcies etc  with the passing of private property this ninetyfive per cent of the cases that cluttered the courts also passed  the courts became shadows attenuated ghosts rudimentary vestiges of the anarchistic times that had preceded the coming of goliah  the year 1925 was a lively year in the worlds history  goliah ruled the world with a strong hand  kings and emperors journeyed to palgrave island saw the wonders of energon and went away with the fear of death in their hearts to abdicate thrones and crowns and hereditary licenses when goliah spoke to politicians socalled statesmen they obeyed    or died  he dictated universal reforms dissolved refractory parliaments and to the great conspiracy that was formed of mutinous money lords and captains of industry he sent his destroying angels  the time is past for fooling he told them  you are anachronisms  you stand in the way of humanity  to the scrapheap with you  to those that protested and they were many he said this is no time for logomachy  you can argue for centuries  it is what you have done in the past  i have no time for argument  get out of the way  with the exception of putting a stop to war and of indicating the broad general plan goliah did nothing  by putting the fear of death into the hearts of those that sat in the high places and obstructed progress goliah made the opportunity for the unshackled intelligence of the best social thinkers of the world to exert itself  goliah left all the multitudinous details of reconstruction to these social thinkers  he wanted them to prove that they were able to do it and they proved it it was due to their initiative that the white plague was stamped out from the world  it was due to them and in spite of a deal of protesting from the sentimentalists that all the extreme hereditary inefficients were segregated and denied marriage  goliah had nothing whatever to do with the instituting of the colleges of invention  this idea originated practically simultaneously in the minds of thousands of social thinkers  the time was ripe for the realization of the idea and everywhere arose the splendid institutions of invention for the first time the ingenuity of man was loosed upon the problem of simplifying life instead of upon the making of moneyearning devices the affairs of life such as housecleaning dish and windowwashing dustremoving and scrubbing and clotheswashing and all the endless sordid and necessary details were simplified by invention until they became automatic  we of today cannot realize the barbarously filthy and slavish lives of those that lived prior to 1925  the international government of the world was another idea that sprang simultaneously into the minds of thousands  the successful realization of this idea was a surprise to many but as a surprise it was nothing to that received by the mildly protestant sociologists and biologists when irrefutable facts exploded the doctrine of malthus  with leisure and joy in the world with an immensely higher standard of living and with the enormous spaciousness of opportunity for recreation development and pursuit of beauty and nobility and all the higher attributes the birthrate fell and fell astoundingly  people ceased breeding like cattle  and better than that it was immediately noticeable that a higher average of children was being born  the doctrine of malthus was knocked into a cocked hator flung to the scrapheap as goliah would have put it  all that goliah had predicted that the intelligence of mankind could accomplish with the mechanical energy at its disposal came to pass human dissatisfaction practically disappeared  the elderly people were the great grumblers but when they were honourably pensioned by society as they passed the age limit for work the great majority ceased grumbling  they found themselves better off in their idle old days under the new regime enjoying vastly more pleasure and comforts than they had in their busy and toilsome youth under the old regime  the younger generation had easily adapted itself too the changed order and the very young had never known anything else  the sum of human happiness had increased enormously  the world had become gay and sane  even the old fogies of professors of sociology who had opposed with might and main the coming of the new regime made no complaint  they were a score of times better remunerated than in the old days and they were not worked nearly so hard  besides they were busy revising sociology and writing new textbooks on the subject  here and there it is true there were atavisms men who yearned for the fleshpots and cannibalfeasts of the old alleged individualism creatures long of teeth and savage of claw who wanted to prey upon their fellowmen but they were looked upon as diseased and were treated in hospitals  a small remnant however proved incurable and was confined in asylums and denied marriage  thus there was no progeny to inherit their atavistic tendencies  as the years went by goliah dropped out of the running of the world there was nothing for him to run  the world was running itself and doing it smoothly and beautifully  in 1937 goliah made his longpromised present of energon to the world  he himself had devised a thousand ways in which the little giant should do the work of the worldall of which he made public at the same time  but instantly the colleges of invention seized upon energon and utilized it in a hundred thousand additional ways  in fact as goliah confessed in his letter of march 1938 the colleges of invention cleared up several puzzling features of energon that had baffled him during the preceding years with the introduction of the use of energon the twohour workday was cut down almost to nothing  as goliah had predicted work indeed became play  and so tremendous was mans productive capacity due to energon and the rational social utilization of it that the humblest citizen enjoyed leisure and time and opportunity for an immensely greater abundance of living than had the most favoured under the old anarchistic system  nobody had ever seen goliah and all peoples began to clamour for their saviour to appear  while the world did not minimize his discovery of energon it was decided that greater than that was his wide social vision  he was a superman a scientific superman and the curiosity of the world to see him had become wellnigh unbearable  it was in 1941 after much hesitancy on his part that he finally emerged from palgrave island  he arrived on june 6 in san francisco and for the first time since his retirement to palgrave island the world looked upon his face and the world was disappointed  its imagination had been touched  an heroic figure had been made out of goliah  he was the man or the demigod rather who had turned the planet over  the deeds of alexander caesar genghis khan and napoleon were as the play of babes alongside his colossal achievements  and ashore in san francisco and through its streets stepped and rode a little old man sixtyfive years of age well preserved with a pinkandwhite complexion and a bald spot on his head the size of an apple  he was shortsighted and wore spectacles  but when the spectacles were removed his were quizzical blue eyes like a childs filled with mild wonder at the world  also his eyes had a way of twinkling accompanied by a screwing up of the face as if he laughed at the huge joke he had played upon the world trapping it in spite of itself into happiness and laughter  for a scientific superman and world tyrant he had remarkable weaknesses he loved sweets and was inordinately fond of salted almonds and salted pecans especially of the latter  he always carried a paper bag of them in his pocket and he had a way of saying frequently that the chemism of his nature demanded such fare  perhaps his most astonishing failing was cats  he had an ineradicable aversion to that domestic animal  it will be remembered that he fainted dead away with sudden fright while speaking in brotherhood palace when the janitors cat walked out upon the stage and brushed against his legs  but no sooner had he revealed himself to the world than he was identified  oldtime friends had no difficulty in recognizing him as percival stultz the germanamerican who in 1898 had worked in the union iron works and who for two years at that time had been secretary of branch 369 of the international brotherhood of machinists  it was in 1901 then twentyfive years of age that he had taken special scientific courses at the university of california at the same time supporting himself by soliciting what was then known as life insurance  his records as a student are preserved in the university museum and they are unenviable  he is remembered by the professors he sat under chiefly for his absentmindedness  undoubtedly even then he was catching glimpses of the wide visions that later were to be his  his naming himself goliah and shrouding himself in mystery was his little joke he later explained  as goliah or any other thing like that he said he was able to touch the imagination of the world and turn it over but as percival stultz wearing sidewhiskers and spectacles and weighing one hundred and eighteen pounds he would have been unable to turn over a pecannot even a salted pecan  but the world quickly got over its disappointment in his personal appearance and antecedents  it knew him and revered him as the mastermind of the ages and it loved him for himself for his quizzical shortsighted eyes and the inimitable way in which he screwed up his face when he laughed it loved him for his simplicity and comradeship and warm humanness and for his fondness for salted pecans and his aversion to cats  and today in the wondercity of asgard rises in awful beauty that monument to him that dwarfs the pyramids and all the monstrous bloodstained monuments of antiquity  and on that monument as all know is inscribed in imperishable bronze the prophecy and the fulfilment all will be joysmiths and their task shall be to beat out laughter from the ringing anvil of life  editorial notethis remarkable production is the work of harry beckwith a student in the lowell high school of san francisco and it is here reproduced chiefly because of the youth of its author  far be it from our policy to burden our readers with ancient history and when it is known that harry beckwith was only fifteen when the foregoing was written our motive will be understood  goliah won the premier for high school composition in 2254 and last year harry beckwith took advantage of the privilege earned by electing to spend six months in asgard  the wealth of historical detail the atmosphere of the times and the mature style of the composition are especially noteworthy in one so young     the golden poppy   i have a poppy field  that is by the grace of god and the goodnature of editors i am enabled to place each month divers gold pieces into a clerical gentlemans hands and in return for said gold pieces i am each month reinvested with certain proprietaryrights in a poppy field  this field blazes on the rim of the piedmont hills  beneath lies all the world  in the distance across the silver sweep of bay san francisco smokes on her many hills like a second rome  not far away mount tamalpais thrusts a rugged shoulder into the sky and midway between is the golden gate where sea mists love to linger  from the poppy field we often see the shimmering blue of the pacific beyond and the busy ships that go for ever out and in  we shall have great joy in our poppy field said bess  yes said i how the poor city folk will envy when they come to see us and how we will make all well again when we send them off with great golden armfuls  but those things will have to come down i added pointing to numerous obtrusive notices relics of the last tenant displayed conspicuously along the boundaries and bearing each and all this legend      private grounds  no trespassing  why should we refuse the poor city folk a ramble over our field because forsooth they have not the advantage of our acquaintance  how i abhor such things said bess the arrogant symbols of power  they disgrace human nature said i  they shame the generous landscape she said and they are abominable  piggish quoth i hotly  down with them  we looked forward to the coming of the poppies did bess and i looked forward as only creatures of the city may look who have been long denied i have forgotten to mention the existence of a house above the poppy field a squat and wandering bungalow in which we had elected to forsake town traditions and live in fresher and more vigorous ways  the first poppies came orangeyellow and golden in the standing grain and we went about gleefully as though drunken with their wine and told each other that the poppies were there  we laughed at unexpected moments in the midst of silences and at times grew ashamed and stole forth secretly to gaze upon our treasury  but when the great wave of poppyflame finally spilled itself down the field we shouted aloud and danced and clapped our hands freely and frankly mad  and then came the goths  my face was in a lather the time of the first invasion and i suspended my razor in midair to gaze out on my beloved field  at the far end i saw a little girl and a little boy their arms filled with yellow spoil  ah thought i an unwonted benevolence burgeoning what a delight to me is their delight  it is sweet that children should pick poppies in my field  all summer shall they pick poppies in my field  but they must be little children i added as an afterthought and they must pick from the lower endthis last prompted by a glance at the great golden fellows nodding in the wheat beneath my window  then the razor descended  shaving was always an absorbing task and i did not glance out of the window again until the operation was completed  and then i was bewildered  surely this was not my poppy field  noand yes for there were the tall pines clustering austerely together on one side the magnolia tree burdened with bloom and the japanese quinces splashing the driveway hedge with blood  yes it was the field but no wave of poppyflame spilled down it nor did the great golden fellows nod in the wheat beneath my window  i rushed into a jacket and out of the house  in the far distance were disappearing two huge balls of colour orange and yellow for all the world like perambulating poppies of cyclopean breed  johnny said i to the nineyearold son of my sister johnny whenever little girls come into our field to pick poppies you must go down to them and in a very quiet and gentlemanly manner tell them it is not allowed  warm days came and the sun drew another blaze from the freebosomed earth  whereupon a neighbours little girl at the behest of her mother duly craved and received permission from bess to gather a few poppies for decorative purposes  but of this i was uninformed and when i descried her in the midst of the field i waved my arms like a semaphore against the sky  little girl called i  little girl  the little girls legs blurred the landscape as she fled and in high elation i sought bess to tell of the potency of my voice  nobly she came to the rescue departing forthwith on an expedition of conciliation and explanation to the little girls mother  but to this day the little girl seeks cover at sight of me and i know the mother will never be as cordial as she would otherwise have been  came dark overcast days stiff driving winds and pelting rains day on day without end and the city folk cowered in their dwellingplaces like floodbeset rats and like rats halfdrowned and gasping when the weather cleared they crawled out and up the green piedmont slopes to bask in the blessed sunshine  and they invaded my field in swarms and droves crushing the sweet wheat into the earth and with lustful hands ripping the poppies out by the roots  i shall put up the warnings against trespassing i said  yes said bess with a sigh  im afraid it is necessary  the day was yet young when she sighed again  im afraid o man that your signs are of no avail  people have forgotten how to read these days  i went out on the porch  a city nymph in cool summer gown and picture hat paused before one of my newly reared warnings and read it through with care  profound deliberation characterized her movements  she was statuesquely tall but with a toss of the head and a flirt of the skirt she dropped on hands and knees crawled under the fence and came to her feet on the inside with poppies in both her hands  i walked down the drive and talked ethically to her and she went away  then i put up more signs  at one time years ago these hills were carpeted with poppies  as between the destructive forces and the will to live the poppies maintained an equilibrium with their environment  but the city folk constituted a new and terrible destructive force the equilibrium was overthrown and the poppies wellnigh perished  since the city folk plucked those with the longest stems and biggest bowls and since it is the law of kind to procreate kind the longstemmed bigbowled poppies failed to go to seed and a stunted shortstemmed variety remained to the hills  and not only was it stunted and shortstemmed but sparsely distributed as well  each day and every day for years and years the city folk swarmed over the piedmont hills and only here and there did the genius of the race survive in the form of miserable little flowers closeclinging and quickblooming like children of the slums dragged hastily and precariously through youth to a shrivelled and futile maturity  on the other hand the poppies had prospered in my field and not only had they been sheltered from the barbarians but also from the birds long ago the field was sown in wheat which went to seed unharvested each year and in the cool depths of which the poppy seeds were hidden from the keeneyed songsters  and further climbing after the sun through the wheat stalks the poppies grew taller and taller and more royal even than the primordial ones of the open  so the city folk gazing from the bare hills to my blazing burning field were sorely tempted and it must be told as sorely fell  but no sorer was their fall than that of my beloved poppies  where the grain holds the dew and takes the bite from the sun the soil is moist and in such soil it is easier to pull the poppies out by the roots than to break the stalk  now the city folk like other folk are inclined to move along the line of least resistance and for each flower they gathered there were also gathered many crisprolled buds and with them all the possibilities and future beauties of the plant for all time to come  one of the city folk a middleaged gentleman with white hands and shifty eyes especially made life interesting for me  we called him the repeater what of his ways  when from the porch we implored him to desist he was wont slowly and casually to direct his steps toward the fence simulating finely the actions of a man who had not heard but whose walk instead had terminated of itself or of his own volition  to heighten this effect now and again still casually and carelessly he would stoop and pluck another poppy  thus did he deceitfully save himself the indignity of being put out and rob us of the satisfaction of putting him out but he came and he came often each time getting away with an ablebodied mans share of plunder  it is not good to be of the city folk  of this i am convinced  there is something in the mode of life that breeds an alarming condition of blindness and deafness or so it seems with the city folk that come to my poppy field  of the many to whom i have talked ethically not one has been found who ever saw the warnings so conspicuously displayed while of those called out to from the porch possibly one in fifty has heard also i have discovered that the relation of city folk to country flowers is quite analogous to that of a starving man to food  no more than the starving man realizes that five pounds of meat is not so good as an ounce do they realize that five hundred poppies crushed and bunched are less beautiful than two or three in a free cluster where the green leaves and golden bowls may expand to their full loveliness  less forgivable than the unaesthetic are the mercenary  hordes of young rascals plunder me and rob the future that they may stand on street corners and retail california poppies only five cents a bunch  in spite of my precautions some of them made a dollar a day out of my field one horde do i remember with keen regret  reconnoitring for a possible dog they applied at the kitchen door for a drink of water please while they drank they were besought not to pick any flowers  they nodded wiped their mouths and proceeded to take themselves off by the side of the bungalow  they smote the poppy field beneath my windows spread out fanshaped six wide picking with both hands and ripped a swath of destruction through the very heart of the field  no cyclone travelled faster or destroyed more completely  i shouted after them but they sped on the wings of the wind great regal poppies brokenstalked and mangled trailing after them or cluttering their wakethe most highhanded act of piracy i am confident ever committed off the high seas  one day i went afishing and on that day a woman entered the field appeals and remonstrances from the porch having no effect upon her bess despatched a little girl to beg of her to pick no more poppies  the woman calmly went on picking  then bess herself went down through the heat of the day  but the woman went on picking and while she picked she discussed property and proprietary rights denying besss sovereignty until deeds and documents should be produced in proof thereof  and all the time she went on picking never once overlooking her hand  she was a large woman belligerent of aspect and bess was only a woman and not prone to fisticuffs  so the invader picked until she could pick no more said goodday and sailed majestically away  people have really grown worse in the last several years i think said bess to me in a tired sort of voice that night as we sat in the library after dinner  next day i was inclined to agree with her  theres a woman and a little girl heading straight for the poppies said may a maid about the bungalow  i went out on the porch and waited their advent  they plunged through the pine trees and into the fields and as the roots of the first poppies were pulled i called to them  they were about a hundred feet away  the woman and the little girl turned to the sound of my voice and looked at me  please do not pick the poppies i pleaded  they pondered this for a minute then the woman said something in an undertone to the little girl and both backs jackknifed as the slaughter recommenced  i shouted but they had become suddenly deaf  i screamed and so fiercely that the little girl wavered dubiously  and while the woman went on picking i could hear her in low tones heartening the little girl  i recollected a siren whistle with which i was wont to summon johnny the son of my sister  it was a fearsome thing of a kind to wake the dead and i blew and blew but the jackknifed backs never unclasped  i do not mind with men but i have never particularly favoured physical encounters with women yet this woman who encouraged a little girl in iniquity tempted me  i went into the bungalow and fetched my rifle  flourishing it in a sanguinary manner and scowling fearsomely i charged upon the invaders the little girl fled screaming to the shelter of the pines but the woman calmly went on picking  she took not the least notice  i had expected her to run at sight of me and it was embarrassing  there was i charging down the field like a wild bull upon a woman who would not get out of the way  i could only slow down supremely conscious of how ridiculous it all was  at a distance of ten feet she straightened up and deigned to look at me  i came to a halt and blushed to the roots of my hair  perhaps i really did frighten her i sometimes try to persuade myself that this is so or perhaps she took pity on me but at any rate she stalked out of my field with great composure nay majesty her arms brimming with orange and gold  nevertheless thenceforward i saved my lungs and flourished my rifle also i made fresh generalizations  to commit robbery women take advantage of their sex  men have more respect for property than women men are less insistent in crime than women  and women are less afraid of guns than men  likewise we conquer the earth in hazard and battle by the virtues of our mothers  we are a race of landrobbers and searobbers we anglosaxons and small wonder when we suckle at the breasts of a breed of women such as maraud my poppy field  still the pillage went on  sirens and gunflourishings were without avail  the city folk were great of heart and undismayed and i noted the habit of repeating was becoming general  what booted it how often they were driven forth if each time they were permitted to carry away their illgotten plunder  when one has turned the same person away twice and thrice an emotion arises somewhat akin to homicide  and when one has once become conscious of this sanguinary feeling his whole destiny seems to grip hold of him and drag him into the abyss  more than once i found myself unconsciously pulling the rifle into position to get a sight on the miserable trespassers  in my sleep i slew them in manifold ways and threw their carcasses into the reservoir  each day the temptation to shoot them in the legs became more luring and every day i felt my fate calling to me imperiously  visions of the gallows rose up before me and with the hemp about my neck i saw stretched out the pitiless future of my children dark with disgrace and shame  i became afraid of myself and bess went about with anxious face privily beseeching my friends to entice me into taking a vacation  then and at the last gasp came the thought that saved me why not confiscate  if their forays were bootless in the nature of things their forays would cease  the first to enter my field thereafter was a man  i was waiting for himand oh joy it was the repeater himself smugly complacent with knowledge of past success  i dropped the rifle negligently across the hollow of my arm and went down to him  i am sorry to trouble you for those poppies i said in my oiliest tones but really you know i must have them  he regarded me speechlessly  it must have made a great picture  it surely was dramatic  with the rifle across my arm and my suave request still ringing in my ears i felt like black bart and jesse james and jack sheppard and robin hood and whole generations of highwaymen  come come i said a little sharply and in what i imagined was the true fashion i am sorry to inconvenience you believe me but i must have those poppies  i absently shifted the gun and smiled  that fetched him  without a word he passed them over and turned his toes toward the fence but no longer casual and careless was his carriage i nor did he stoop to pick the occasional poppy by the way  that was the last of the repeater  i could see by his eyes that he did not like me and his back reproached me all the way down the field and out of sight  from that day the bungalow has been flooded with poppies  every vase and earthen jar is filled with them  they blaze on every mantel and run riot through all the rooms  i present them to my friends in huge bunches and still the kind city folk come and gather more for me  sit down for a moment i say to the departing guest  and there we sit in the shade of the porch while aspiring city creatures pluck my poppies and sweat under the brazen sun  and when their arms are sufficiently weighted with my yellow glories i go down with the rifle over my arm and disburden them thus have i become convinced that every situation has its compensations  confiscation was successful so far as it went but i had forgotten one thing namely the vast number of the city folk  though the old transgressors came no more new ones arrived every day and i found myself confronted with the titanic task of educating a whole cityful to the inexpediency of raiding my poppy field  during the process of disburdening them i was accustomed to explaining my side of the case but i soon gave this over  it was a waste of breath  they could not understand  to one lady who insinuated that i was miserly i said  my dear madam no hardship is worked upon you  had i not been parsimonious yesterday and the day before these poppies would have been picked by the city hordes of that day and the day before and your eyes which today have discovered this field would have beheld no poppies at all  the poppies you may not pick today are the poppies i did not permit to be picked yesterday and the day before  therefore believe me you are denied nothing  but the poppies are here today she said glaring carnivorously upon their glow and splendour  i will pay you for them said a gentleman at another time  i had just relieved him of an armful  i felt a sudden shame i know not why unless it be that his words had just made clear to me that a monetary as well as an aesthetic value was attached to my flowers  the apparent sordidness of my position overwhelmed me and i said weakly i do not sell my poppies  you may have what you have picked  but before the week was out i confronted the same gentleman again  i will pay you for them he said  yes i said you may pay me for them  twenty dollars please  he gasped looked at me searchingly gasped again and silently and sadly put the poppies down  but it remained as usual for a woman to attain the sheerest pitch of audacity  when i declined payment and demanded my plucked beauties she refused to give them up i picked these poppies she said and my time is worth money  when you have paid me for my time you may have them  her cheeks flamed rebellion and her face withal a pretty one was set and determined now i was a man of the hill tribes and she a mere woman of the city folk and though it is not my inclination to enter into details it is my pleasure to state that that bunch of poppies subsequently glorified the bungalow and that the woman departed to the city unpaid  anyway they were my poppies  they are gods poppies said the radiant young radical democratically shocked at sight of me turning city folk out of my field  and for two weeks she hated me with a deathless hatred  i sought her out and explained  i explained at length  i told the story of the poppy as maeterlinck has told the life of the bee  i treated the question biologically psychologically and sociologically i discussed it ethically and aesthetically  i grew warm over it and impassioned and when i had done she professed conversion but in my heart of hearts i knew it to be compassion  i fled to other friends for consolation  i retold the story of the poppy  they did not appear supremely interested i grew excited  they were surprised and pained  they looked at me curiously  it illbefits your dignity to squabble over poppies they said  it is unbecoming  i fled away to yet other friends  i sought vindication  the thing had become vital and i needs must put myself right  i felt called upon to explain though well knowing that he who explains is lost  i told the story of the poppy over again  i went into the minutest details  i added to it and expanded  i talked myself hoarse and when i could talk no more they looked bored  also they said insipid things and soothful things and things concerning other things and not at all to the point i was consumed with anger and there and then i renounced them all  at the bungalow i lie in wait for chance visitors  craftily i broach the subject watching their faces closely the while to detect first signs of disapprobation whereupon i empty longstored vials of wrath upon their heads  i wrangle for hours with whosoever does not say i am right  i am become like guy de maupassants old man who picked up a piece of string i am incessantly explaining and nobody will understand  i have become more brusque in my treatment of the predatory city folk  no longer do i take delight in their disburdenment for it has become an onerous duty a wearisome and distasteful task  my friends look askance and murmur pityingly on the side when we meet in the city  they rarely come to see me now  they are afraid  i am an embittered and disappointed man and all the light seems to have gone out of my life and into my blazing field  so one pays for things  piedmont california april 1902     the shrinkage of the planet   what a tremendous affair it was the world of homer with its indeterminate boundaries vast regions and immeasurable distances  the mediterranean and the euxine were illimitable stretches of ocean waste over which years could be spent in endless wandering  on their mysterious shores were the improbable homes of impossible peoples  the great sea the broad sea the boundless sea the ethiopians dwelling far away the most distant of men and the cimmerians covered with darkness and cloud where baleful night is spread over timid mortals phoenicia was a sore journey egypt simply unattainable while the pillars of hercules marked the extreme edge of the universe  ulysses was nine days in sailing from ismarus the city of the ciconians to the country of the lotuseatersa period of time which today would breed anxiety in the hearts of the underwriters should it be occupied by the slowest tramp steamer in traversing the mediterranean and black seas from gibraltar to sebastopol  homers world restricted to less than a drummers circuit was nevertheless immense surrounded by a thin veneer of universethe stream of ocean  but how it has shrunk  today precisely charted weighed and measured a thousand times larger than the world of homer it is become a tiny speck gyrating to immutable law through a universe the bounds of which have been pushed incalculably back  the light of algol shines upon ita light which travels at one hundred and ninety thousand miles per second yet requires fortyseven years to reach its destination  and the denizens of this puny ball have come to know that algol possesses an invisible companion three and a quarter millions of miles away and that the twain move in their respective orbits at rates of fiftyfive and twentysix miles per second  they also know that beyond it are great chasms of space innumerable worlds and vast star systems  while much of the shrinkage to which the planet has been subjected is due to the increased knowledge of mathematics and physics an equal if not greater portion may be ascribed to the perfection of the means of locomotion and communication  the enlargement of stellar space demonstrating with stunning force the insignificance of the earth has been negative in its effect but the quickening of travel and intercourse by making the earths parts accessible and knitting them together has been positive  the advantage of the animal over the vegetable kingdom is obvious  the cabbage should its environment tend to become worse must live it out or die the rabbit may move on in quest of a better  but after all the swiftfooted creatures are circumscribed in their wanderings  the first large river almost inevitably bars their way and certainly the first salt sea becomes an impassable obstacle  better locomotion may be classed as one of the prime aims of the old natural selection for in that primordial day the race was to the swift as surely as the battle to the strong  but man already preeminent in the common domain because of other faculties was not content with the one form of locomotion afforded by his lower limbs  he swam in the sea and still better becoming aware of the buoyant virtues of wood learned to navigate its surface likewise from among the land animals he chose the more likely to bear him and his burdens  the next step was the domestication of these useful aids  here in its organic significance natural selection ceased to concern itself with locomotion  man had displayed his impatience at her tedious methods and his own superiority in the hastening of affairs thenceforth he must depend upon himself and fasterswimming or fasterrunning men ceased to be bred  the one halfamphibian breasting the water with muscular arms could not hope to overtake or escape an enemy who propelled a firehollowed tree trunk by means of a wooden paddle nor could the other trusting to his own nimbleness compete with a foe who careered wildly across the plain on the back of a halfbroken stallion  so in that dim day man took upon himself the task of increasing his dominion over space and time and right nobly has he acquitted himself because of it he became a road builder and a bridge builder likewise he wove clumsy sails of rush and matting  at a very remote period he must also have recognized that force moves along the line of least resistance and in virtue thereof placed upon his craft rude keels which enabled him to beat to windward in a seaway  as he excelled in these humble arts just so did he add to his power over his less progressive fellows and lay the foundations for the first glimmering civilizationscrude they were beyond conception sporadic and ephemeral but each formed a necessary part of the groundwork upon which was to rise the mighty civilization of our latterday world  divorced from the general history of mans upward climb it would seem incredible that so long a time should elapse between the moment of his first improvements over nature in the matter of locomotion and that of the radical changes he was ultimately to compass  the principles which were his before history was were his neither more nor less even to the present century  he utilized improved applications but the principles of themselves were ever the same whether in the war chariots of achilles and pharaoh or the mailcoach and diligence of the european traveller the cavalry of the huns or of prince rupert the triremes and galleys of greece and rome or the east indiamen and clipper ships of the last century  but when the moment came to alter the methods of travel the change was so sweeping that it may be safely classed as a revolution though the discovery of steam attaches to the honour of the last century the potency of the new power was not felt till the beginning of this  by 1800 small steamers were being used for coasting purposes in england 1830 witnessed the opening of the liverpool and manchester railway while it was not until 1838 that the atlantic was first crossed by the steamships great western and sirius  in 1869 the east was made nextdoor neighbour to the west  over almost the same ground where had toiled the caravans of a thousand generations the suez canal was dug clive during his first trip was a year and a half en route from england to india were he alive today he could journey to calcutta in twentytwo days  after reading de quinceys hyperbolical description of the english mailcoach one cannot down the desire to place that remarkable man on the pilot of the white mail or of the twentieth century  but this tremendous change in the means of locomotion meant far more than the mere rapid transit of men from place to place  until then though its influence and worth cannot be overestimated commerce had eked out a precarious and costly existence  the fortuitous played too large a part in the trade of men  the mischances by land and sea the mistakes and delays were adverse elements of no mean proportions  but improved locomotion meant improved carrying and commerce received an impetus as remarkable as it was unexpected  in his fondest fancies james watt could not have foreseen even the approximate result of his invention the hercules which was to spring from the puny child of his brain and hands an illuminating spectacle were it possible would be afforded by summoning him from among the shades to a place in the engineroom of an ocean greyhound  the humblest trimmer would treat him with the indulgence of a child while an oiler a greasy nimbus about his head and in his hand as sceptre a longsnouted can would indeed appear to him a demigod and ruler of forces beyond his ken  it has ever been the worlds dictum that empire and commerce go hand in hand  in the past the one was impossible without the other  rome gathered to herself the wealth of the mediterranean nations and it was only by an unwise distribution of it that she became emasculated and lost both power and trade  with a just system of economics it is highly probable that for centuries she could have held back the welling tide of the germanic peoples  when upon her ruins rose the institutions of the conquering teutons commerce slipped away and with it empire  in the present empire and commerce have become interdependent  such wonders has the industrial revolution wrought in a few swift decades and so great has been the shrinkage of the planet that the industrial nations have long since felt the imperative demand for foreign markets  the favoured portions of the earth are occupied  from their seats in the temperate zones the militant commercial nations proceed to the exploitation of the tropics and for the possession of these they rush to war hotfooted  like wolves at the end of a gorge they wrangle over the fragments  there are no more planets no more fragments and they are yet hungry  there are no longer cimmerians and ethiopians in widestretching lands awaiting them  on either hand they confront the naked poles and they recoil from unnavigable space to an intenser struggle among themselves  and all the while the planet shrinks beneath their grasp  of this struggle one thing may be safely predicated a commercial power must be a sea power  upon the control of the sea depends the control of trade  carthage threatened rome till she lost her navy and then for thirteen days the smoke of her burning rose to the skies and the ground was ploughed and sown with salt on the site of her most splendid edifices  the cities of italy were the worlds merchants till new trade routes were discovered and the dominion of the sea passed on to the west and fell into other hands  spain and portugal inaugurating an era of maritime discovery divided the new world between them but gave way before a breed of searovers who after many generations of attachment to the soil had returned to their ancient element  with the destruction of her armada spains colossal dream of colonial empire passed away against the new power holland strove in vain and when france acknowledged the superiority of the briton upon the sea she at the same time relinquished her designs upon the world  hampered by her feeble navy her contest for supremacy upon the land was her last effort and with the passing of napoleon she retired within herself to struggle with herself as best she might  for fifty years england held undisputed sway upon the sea controlled markets and domineered trade laying during that period the foundations of her empire  since then other naval powers have arisen their attitudes bearing significantly upon the future for they have learned that the mastery of the world belongs to the masters of the sea  that many of the phases of this world shrinkage are pathetic goes without question  there is much to condemn in the rise of the economic over the imaginative spirit much for which the energetic philistine can never atone  perhaps the deepest pathos of all may be found in the spectacle of john ruskin weeping at the profanation of the world by the vandalism of the age  steam launches violate the sanctity of the venetian canals where xerxes bridged the hellespont ply the filthy funnels of our modern shipping electric cars run in the shadow of the pyramids and it was only the other day that lord kitchener was in a railroad wreck near the site of ancient luxor  but there is always the other side  if the economic man has defiled temples and despoiled nature he has also preserved  he has policed the world and parked it reduced the dangers of life and limb made the tenure of existence less precarious and rendered a general relapse of society impossible  there can never again be an intellectual holocaust such as the burning of the alexandrian library  civilizations may wax and wane but the totality of knowledge cannot decrease  with the possible exception of a few trade secrets arts and sciences may be discarded but they can never be lost and these things must remain true until the end of mans time upon the earth  up to yesterday communication for any distance beyond the sound of the human voice or the sight of the human eye was bound up with locomotion a letter presupposed a carrier  the messenger started with the message and he could not but avail himself of the prevailing modes of travel  if the voyage to australia required four months four months were required for communication by no known means could this time be lessened  but with the advent of the telegraph and telephone communication and locomotion were divorced  in a few hours at most there could be performed what by the old way would have required months  in 1837 the needle telegraph was invented and nine years later the electric telegraph company was formed for the purpose of bringing it into general use  government postal systems also came into being later to consolidate into an international union and to group the nations of the earth into a local neighbourhood  the effects of all this are obvious and no fitter illustration may be presented than the fact that today in the matter of communication the klondike is virtually nearer to boston than was bunker hill in the time of warren  a contemporaneous and remarkable shrinkage of a vast stretch of territory may be instanced in the northland  from its rise at lake linderman the yukon runs twentyfive hundred miles to bering sea traversing an almost unknown region the remote recesses of which had never felt the moccasined foot of the pathfinder  at occasional intervals men wallowed into its dismal fastnesses or emerged gaunt and famineworn  but in the fall of 1896 a great gold strike was madegreater than any since the days of california and australia yet so rude were the means of communication nearly a year elapsed before the news of it reached the eager ear of the world  passionate pilgrims disembarked their outfits at dyea  over the terrible chilcoot pass the trail led to the lakes thirty miles away  carriage was yet in its most primitive stage the road builder and bridge builder unheard of  with heavy packs upon their backs men plunged waistdeep into hideous quagmires bridged mountain torrents by felling trees across them toiled against the precipitous slopes of the iceworn mountains and crossed the dizzy faces of innumerable glaciers  when after incalculable toil they reached the lakes they went into the woods sawed pine trees into lumber by hand and built it into boats  in these overloaded unseaworthy they battled down the long chain of lakes  within the memory of the writer there lingers the picture of a sheltered nook on the shores of lake le barge in which half a thousand gold seekers lay stormbound  day after day they struggled against the seas in the teeth of a northerly gale and night after night returned to their camps repulsed but not disheartened  at the rapids they ran their boats through hit or miss and after infinite toil and hardship on the breast of a jarring ice flood arrived at the klondike from the beach at dyea to the eddy below the barracks at dawson they had paid for their temerity the tax of human life demanded by the elements a year later so greatly had the country shrunk the tourist on disembarking from the ocean steamship took his seat in a modern railway coach  a few hours later at lake bennet he stepped aboard a commodious river steamer  at the rapids he rode around on a tramway to take passage on another steamer below  and in a few hours more he was in dawson without having once soiled the lustre of his civilized footgear  did he wish to communicate with the outside world he strolled into the telegraph office  a few short months before he would have written a letter and deemed himself favoured above mortals were it delivered within the year  from mans drawing the world closer and closer together his own affairs and institutions have consolidated  concentration may typify the chief movement of the ageconcentration classification order the reduction of friction between the parts of the social organism  the urban tendency of the rural populations led to terrible congestion in the great cities there was stifling and impure air and lo rapid transit at once attacked the evil  every great city has become but the nucleus of a greater city which surrounds it the one the seat of business the other the seat of domestic happiness  between the two night and morning by electric road steam railway and bicycle path ebbs and flows the middleclass population  and in the same direction lies the remedy for the tenement evil  in the cleansing country air the slum cannot exist  improvement in roadbeds and the means of locomotion a tremor of altruism a little legislation and the city by day will sleep in the country by night  what a playball has this planet of ours become  steam has made its parts accessible and drawn them closer together  the telegraph annihilates space and time  each morning every part knows what every other part is thinking contemplating or doing  a discovery in a german laboratory is being demonstrated in san francisco within twentyfour hours  a book written in south africa is published by simultaneous copyright in every englishspeaking country and on the following day is in the hands of the translators  the death of an obscure missionary in china or of a whisky smuggler in the south seas is served up the world over with the morning toast  the wheat output of argentine or the gold of klondike is known wherever men meet and trade  shrinkage or centralization has been such that the humblest clerk in any metropolis may place his hand on the pulse of the world  and because of all this everywhere is growing order and organization  the church the state men women and children the criminal and the law the honest man and the thief industry and commerce capital and labour the trades and the professions the arts and the sciencesall are organizing for pleasure profit policy or intellectual pursuit  they have come to know the strength of numbers solidly phalanxed and driving onward with singleness of purpose  these purposes may be various and many but one and all ever discovering new mutual interests and objects obeying a law which is beyond them these petty aggregations draw closer together forming greater aggregations and congeries of aggregations  and these in turn vaguely merging each into each present glimmering adumbrations of the coming human solidarity which shall be mans crowning glory  oakland california january 1900     the house beautiful   speaking of homes i am building one now and i venture to assert that very few homes have received more serious thought in the planning  let me tell you about it  in the first place there will be no grounds whatever no fences lawns nor flowers  roughly the dimensions will be fortyfive feet by fifteen  that is it will be fifteen feet wide at its widestand if you will pardon the bull it will be narrower than it is wide  the details must submit to the general plan of economy  there will be no veranda no porch entrances no grand staircases  im ashamed to say how steep the stairways are going to be  the bedrooms will be seven by seven and one will be even smaller  a bedroom is only good to sleep in anyway  there will be no hallway thank goodness  rooms were made to go through  why a separate passage for traffic  the bathroom will be a trifle larger than the size of the smallest bathtubit wont require so much work to keep in order  the kitchen wont be very much larger but this will make it easy for the cook  in place of a drawingroom there will be a large livingroomfourteen by six  the walls of this room will be covered with books and it can serve as library and smokingroom as well  then the floorspace not being occupied we shall use the room as a diningroom  incidentally such a room not being used after bedtime the cook and the second boy can sleep in it  one thing that i am temperamentally opposed to is waste and why should all this splendid room be wasted at night when we do not occupy it  my ideas are cramped you sayoh i forgot to tell you that this home i am describing is to be a floating home and that my wife and i are to journey around the world in it for the matter of seven years or more  i forgot also to state that there will be an engineroom in it for a seventyhorsepower engine a dynamo storage batteries etc tanks for water to last long weeks at sea space for fifteen hundred gallons of gasolene fire extinguishers and lifepreservers and a great storeroom for food spare sails anchors hawsers tackles and a thousand and one other things  since i have not yet built my land house i havent got beyond a few general ideas and in presenting them i feel as cocksure as the unmarried woman who writes the column in the sunday supplement on how to rear children  my first idea about a house is that it should be built to live in  throughout the house in all the building of it this should be the paramount idea  it must be granted that this idea is lost sight of by countless persons who build houses apparently for every purpose under the sun except to live in them  perhaps it is because of the practical life i have lived that i worship utility and have come to believe that utility and beauty should be one and that there is no utility that need not be beautiful  what finer beauty than strengthwhether it be airy steel or massive masonry or a womans hand  a plain black leather strap is beautiful  it is all strength and all utility and it is beautiful  it efficiently performs work in the world and it is good to look upon  perhaps it is because it is useful that it is beautiful  i do not know  i sometimes wonder  a boat on the sea is beautiful  yet it is not built for beauty  every graceful line of it is a utility is designed to perform work  it is created for the express purpose of dividing the water in front of it of gliding over the water beneath it of leaving the water behind itand all with the least possible wastage of stress and friction  it is not created for the purpose of filling the eye with beauty  it is created for the purpose of moving through the sea and over the sea with the smallest resistance and the greatest stability yet somehow it does fill the eye with its beauty  and in so far as a boat fails in its purpose by that much does it diminish in beauty  i am still a long way from the house i have in my mind some day to build yet i have arrived somewhere  i have discovered to my own satisfaction at any rate that beauty and utility should be one  in applying this general idea to the building of a house it may be stated in another and better way namely construction and decoration must be one  this idea is more important than the building of the house for without the idea the house so built is certain to be an insult to intelligence and beautylove  i bought a house in a hurry in the city of oakland some time ago  i do not live in it  i sleep in it half a dozen times a year  i do not love the house  i am hurt every time i look at it  no drunken rowdy or political enemy can insult me so deeply as that house does  let me tell you why  it is an ordinary twostorey frame house  after it was built the criminal that constructed it nailed on at the corners perpendicularly some twoinch fluted planks  these planks rise the height of the house and to a drunken man have the appearance of fluted columns  to complete the illusion in the eyes of the drunken man the planks are topped with wooden ionic capitals nailed on and in i may say basrelief  when i analyze the irritation these fluted planks cause in me i find the reason in the fact that the first rule for building a house has been violated  these decorative planks are no part of the construction  they have no use no work to perform  they are plastered gawds that tell lies that nobody believes  a column is made for the purpose of supporting weight this is its use  a column when it is a utility is beautiful the fluted wooden columns nailed on outside my house are not utilities they are not beautiful  they are nightmares  they not only support no weight but they themselves are a weight that drags upon the supports of the house  some day when i get time one of two things will surely happen  either ill go forth and murder the man who perpetrated the atrocity or else ill take an axe and chop off the lying fluted planks  a thing must be true or it is not beautiful any more than a painted wanton is beautiful any more than a skyscraper is beautiful that is intrinsically and structurally light and that has a false massiveness of pillars plastered on outside  the true skyscraper is beautifuland this is the reluctant admission of a man who dislikes humanityfestering cities  the true skyscraper is beautiful and it is beautiful in so far as it is true  in its construction it is light and airy therefore in its appearance it must be light and airy  it dare not if it wishes to be beautiful lay claim to what it is not  and it should not bulk on the cityscape like leviathan it should rise and soar light and airy and fairylike  man is an ethical animalor at least he is more ethical than any other animal  wherefore he has certain yearnings for honesty  and in no way can these yearnings be more thoroughly satisfied than by the honesty of the house in which he lives and passes the greater part of his life  they that dwelt in san francisco were dishonest  they lied and cheated in their business life like the dwellers in all cities and because they lied and cheated in their business life they lied and cheated in the buildings they erected  upon the tops of the simple severe walls of their buildings they plastered huge projecting cornices  these cornices were not part of the construction  they made believe to be part of the construction and they were lies  the earth wrinkled its back for twentyeight seconds and the lying cornices crashed down as all lies are doomed to crash down  in this particular instance the lies crashed down upon the heads of the people fleeing from their reeling habitations and many were killed  they paid the penalty of dishonesty  not alone should the construction of a house be truthful and honest but the material must be honest  they that lived in san francisco were dishonest in the material they used  they sold one quality of material and delivered another quality of material  they always delivered an inferior quality  there is not one case recorded in the business history of san francisco where a contractor or builder delivered a quality superior to the one sold  a sevenmilliondollar city hall became thirty cents in twentyeight seconds  because the mortar was not honest a thousand walls crashed down and scores of lives were snuffed out  there is something after all in the contention of a few religionists that the san francisco earthquake was a punishment for sin  it was a punishment for sin but it was not for sin against god  the people of san francisco sinned against themselves  an honest house tells the truth about itself  there is a house here in glen ellen  it stands on a corner  it is built of beautiful red stone yet it is not beautiful  on three sides the stone is joined and pointed the fourth side is the rear  it faces the back yard  the stone is not pointed  it is all a smudge of dirty mortar with here and there bricks worked in when the stone gave out  the house is not what it seems  it is a lie  all three of the walls spend their time lying about the fourth wall  they keep shouting out that the fourth wall is as beautiful as they  if i lived long in that house i should not be responsible for my morals  the house is like a man in purple and fine linen who hasnt had a bath for a month  if i lived long in that house i should become a dandy and cut out bathingfor the same reason i suppose that an african is black and that an eskimo eats whaleblubber  i shall not build a house like that house  last year i started to build a barn  a man who was a liar undertook to do the stonework and concrete work for me  he could not tell the truth to my face he could not tell the truth in his work  i was building for posterity  the concrete foundations were four feet wide and sunk three and onehalf feet into the earth  the stone walls were two feet thick and nine feet high  upon them were to rest the great beams that were to carry all the weight of hay and the forty tons of the roof  the man who was a liar made beautiful stone walls  i used to stand alongside of them and love them  i caressed their massive strength with my hands  i thought about them in bed before i went to sheep  and they were lies  came the earthquake  fortunately the rest of the building of the barn had been postponed  the beautiful stone walls cracked in all directions i started to repair and discovered the whole enormous lie  the walls were shells  on each face were beautiful massive stoneson edge  the inside was hollow  this hollow in some places was filled with clay and loose gravel  in other places it was filled with air and emptiness with here and there a piece of kindlingwood or drygoods box to aid in the making of the shell  the walls were lies  they were beautiful but they were not useful  construction and decoration had been divorced  the walls were all decoration  they hadnt any construction in them  as god lets satan live i let that lying man live buti have built new walls from the foundation up  and now to my own house beautiful which i shall build some seven or ten years from now  i have a few general ideas about it  it must be honest in construction material and appearance  if any feature of it despite my efforts shall tell lies i shall remove that feature  utility and beauty must be indissolubly wedded  construction and decoration must be one  if the particular details keep true to these general ideas all will be well  i have not thought of many details  but here are a few  take the bathroom for instance  it shall be as beautiful as any room in the house just as it will be as useful  the chance is that it will be the most expensive room in the house  upon that we are resolvedeven if we are compelled to build it first and to live in a tent till we can get more money to go on with the rest of the house  in the bathroom no delights of the bath shall be lacking  also a large part of the expensiveness will be due to the use of material that will make it easy to keep the bathroom clean and in order  why should a servant toil unduly that my body may be clean  on the other hand the honesty of my own flesh and the square dealing i give it are more important than all the admiration of my friends for expensive decorative schemes and magnificent trivialities  more delightful to me is a body that sings than a stately and costly grand staircase built for show  not that i like grand staircases less but that i like bathrooms more  i often regret that i was born in this particular period of the world in the matter of servants how i wish i were living in the golden future of the world where there will be no servantsnaught but service of love  but in the meantime living here and now being practical understanding the rationality and the necessity of the division of labour i accept servants  but such acceptance does not justify me in lack of consideration for them  in my house beautiful their rooms shall not be dens and holes  and on this score i foresee a fight with the architect  they shall have bathrooms toilet conveniences and comforts for their leisure time and human lifeif i have to work sundays to pay for it  even under the division of labour i recognize that no man has a right to servants who will not treat them as humans compounded of the same clay as himself with similar bundles of nerves and desires contradictions irritabilities and lovablenesses  heaven in the drawingroom and hell in the kitchen is not the atmosphere for a growing child to breathenor an adult either  one of the great and selfish objections to chattel slavery was the effect on the masters themselves  and because of the foregoing one chief aim in the building of my house beautiful will be to have a house that will require the minimum of trouble and work to keep clean and orderly  it will be no spick and span and polished house with an immaculateness that testifies to the tragedy of drudge  i live in california where the days are warm  id prefer that the servants had three hours to go swimming or hammocking than be compelled to spend those three hours in keeping the house spick and span therefore it devolves upon me to build a house that can be kept clean and orderly without the need of those three hours  but underneath the spick and span there is something more dreadful than the servitude of the servants  this dreadful thing is the philosophy of the spick and span  in korea the national costume is white  nobleman and coolie dress alike in white  it is hell on the women who do the washing but there is more in it than that  the coolie cannot keep his white clothes clean  he toils and they get dirty  the dirty white of his costume is the token of his inferiority  the noblemans dress is always spotless white  it means that he doesnt have to work  but it means further that somebody else has to work for him  his superiority is not based upon songcraft nor statecraft upon the footraces he has run nor the wrestlers he has thrown  his superiority is based upon the fact that he doesnt have to work and that others are compelled to work for him  and so the korean drone flaunts his clean white clothes for the same reason that the chinese flaunts his monstrous fingernails and the white man and woman flaunt the spickandspanness of their spotless houses  there will be hardwood floors in my house beautiful  but these floors will not be polished mirrors nor skatingrinks  they will be just plain and common hardwood floors  beautiful carpets are not beautiful to the mind that knows they are filled with germs and bacilli  they are no more beautiful than the hectic flush of fever or the silvery skin of leprosy besides carpets enslave  a thing that enslaves is a monster and monsters are not beautiful  the fireplaces in my house will be many and large  small fires and cold weather mean hermeticallysealed rooms and a jealous cherishing of heated and filthladen air  with large fireplaces and generous heat some windows may be open all the time and without hardship all the windows can be opened every little while and the rooms flushed with clean pure air  i have nearly died in the stagnant rotten air of other peoples housesespecially in the eastern states  in maine i have slept in a room with stormwindows immovable and with one small pane five inches by six that could be opened  did i say slept  i panted with my mouth in the opening and blasphemed till i ruined all my chances of heaven  for countless thousands of years my ancestors have lived and died and drawn all their breaths in the open air  it is only recently that we have begun to live in houses  the change is a hardship especially on the lungs  ive got only one pair of lungs and i havent the address of any repairshop  wherefore i stick by the open air as much as possible for this reason my house will have large verandas and near to the kitchen there will be a veranda diningroom  also there will be a veranda fireplace where we can breathe fresh air and be comfortable when the evenings are touched with frost  i have a plan for my own bedroom  i spend long hours in bed reading studying and working  i have tried sleeping in the open but the lamp attracts all the creeping crawling butting flying fluttering things to the pages of my book into my ears and blankets and down the back of my neck  so my bedroom shall be indoors  but it will be not be of indoors  three sides of it will be open  the fourth side will divide it from the rest of the house  the three sides will be screened against the creeping fluttering things but not against the good fresh air and all the breezes that blow  for protection against storm to keep out the driving rain there will be a sliding glass so made that when not in use it will occupy small space and shut out very little air  there is little more to say about this house  i am to build seven or ten years from now  there is plenty of time in which to work up all the details in accord with the general principles i have laid down  it will be a usable house and a beautiful house wherein the aesthetic guest can find comfort for his eyes as well as for his body  it will be a happy houseor else ill burn it down  it will be a house of air and sunshine and laughter  these three cannot be divorced  laughter without air and sunshine becomes morbid decadent demoniac  i have in me a thousand generations  laughter that is decadent is not good for these thousand generations  glen ellen california july 1906     the gold hunters of the north       where the northern lights come down a nights to dance on the     houseless snow  ivan i forbid you to go farther in this undertaking  not a word about this or we are all undone  let the americans and the english know that we have gold in these mountains then we are ruined  they will rush in on us by thousands and crowd us to the wallto the death  so spoke the old russian governor baranov at sitka in 1804 to one of his slavonian hunters who had just drawn from his pocket a handful of golden nuggets  full well baranov fur trader and autocrat understood and feared the coming of the sturdy indomitable gold hunters of anglosaxon stock  and thus he suppressed the news as did the governors that followed him so that when the united states bought alaska in 1867 she bought it for its furs and fisheries without a thought of its treasures underground  no sooner however had alaska become american soil than thousands of our adventurers were afoot and afloat for the north  they were the men of the days of gold the men of california fraser cassiar and cariboo with the mysterious infinite faith of the prospector they believed that the gold streak which ran through the americas from cape horn to california did not peter out in british columbia  that it extended farther north was their creed and farther north became their cry  no time was lost and in the early seventies leaving the treadwell and the silver bow basin to be discovered by those who came after they went plunging on into the white unknown  north farther north they struggled till their picks rang in the frozen beaches of the arctic ocean and they shivered by driftwood fires on the ruby sands of nome  but first in order that this colossal adventure may be fully grasped the recentness and the remoteness of alaska must be emphasized  the interior of alaska and the contiguous canadian territory was a vast wilderness  its hundreds of thousands of square miles were as dark and chartless as darkest africa  in 1847 when the first hudson bay company agents crossed over the rockies from the mackenzie to poach on the preserves of the russian bear they thought that the yukon flowed north and emptied into the arctic ocean  hundreds of miles below however were the outposts of the russian traders  they in turn did not know where the yukon had its source and it was not till later that russ and saxon learned that it was the same mighty stream they were occupying and a little over ten years later frederick whymper voyaged up the great bend to fort yukon under the arctic circle  from fort to fort from york factory on hudsons bay to fort yukon in alaska the english traders transported their goodsa round trip requiring from a year to a year and a half  it was one of their deserters in 1867 escaping down the yukon to bering sea who was the first white man to make the northwest passage by land from the atlantic to the pacific  it was at this time that the first accurate description of a fair portion of the yukon was given by dr w h ball of the smithsonian institution  but even he had never seen its source and it was not given him to appreciate the marvel of that great natural highway  no more remarkable river in this one particular is there in the world taking its rise in crater lake thirty miles from the ocean the yukon flows for twentyfive hundred miles through the heart of the continent ere it empties into the sea  a portage of thirty miles and then a highway for traffic one tenth the girth of the earth  as late as 1869 frederick whymper fellow of the royal geographical society stated on hearsay that the chilcat indians were believed occasionally to make a short portage across the coast range from salt water to the headreaches of the yukon  but it remained for a gold hunter questing north ever north to be first of all white men to cross the terrible chilcoot pass and tap the yukon at its head  this happened only the other day but the man has become a dim legendary hero  holt was his name and already the mists of antiquity have wrapped about the time of his passage  1872 1874 and 1878 are the dates variously givena confusion which time will never clear  holt penetrated as far as the hootalinqua and on his return to the coast reported coarse gold  the next recorded adventurer is one edward bean who in 1880 headed a party of twentyfive miners from sitka into the uncharted land  and in the same year other parties now forgotten for who remembers or ever hears the wanderings of the gold hunters crossed the pass built boats out of the standing timber and drifted down the yukon and farther north  and then for a quarter of a century the unknown and unsung heroes grappled with the frost and groped for the gold they were sure lay somewhere among the shadows of the pole  in the struggle with the terrifying and pitiless natural forces they returned to the primitive garmenting themselves in the skins of wild beasts and covering their feet with the walrus mucluc and the moosehide moccasin  they forgot the world and its ways as the world had forgotten them killed their meat as they found it feasted in plenty and starved in famine and searched unceasingly for the yellow lure  they crisscrossed the land in every direction threaded countless unmapped rivers in precarious birchbark canoes and with snowshoes and dogs broke trail through thousands of miles of silent white where man had never been  they struggled on under the aurora borealis or the midnight sun through temperatures that ranged from one hundred degrees above zero to eighty degrees below living in the grim humour of the land on rabbit tracks and salmon bellies  today a man may wander away from the trail for a hundred days and just as he is congratulating himself that at last he is treading virgin soil he will come upon some ancient and dilapidated cabin and forget his disappointment in wonder at the man who reared the logs  still if one wanders from the trail far enough and deviously enough he may chance upon a few thousand square miles which he may have all to himself  on the other hand no matter how far and how deviously he may wander the possibility always remains that he may stumble not alone upon a deserted cabin but upon an occupied one  as an instance of this and of the vastness of the land no better case need be cited than that of harry maxwell  an able seaman hailing from new bedford massachusetts his ship the brig fannie e lee was pinched in the arctic ice  passing from whaleship to whaleship he eventually turned up at point barrow in the summer of 1880  he was north of the northland and from this point of vantage he determined to pull south of the interior in search of gold  across the mountains from fort macpherson and a couple of hundred miles eastward from the mackenzie he built a cabin and established his headquarters  and here for nineteen continuous years he hunted his living and prospected  he ranged from the never opening ice to the north as far south as the great slave lake  here he met warburton pike the author and exploreran incident he now looks back upon as chief among the few incidents of his solitary life  when this sailorminer had accumulated 20000 worth of dust he concluded that civilization was good enough for him and proceeded to pull for the outside  from the mackenzie he went up the little peel to its headwaters found a pass through the mountains nearly starved to death on his way across to the porcupine hills and eventually came out on the yukon river where he learned for the first time of the yukon gold hunters and their discoveries  yet for twenty years they had been working there his nextdoor neighbours virtually in a land of such great spaces  at victoria british columbia previous to his going east over the canadian pacific the existence of which he had just learned he pregnantly remarked that he had faith in the mackenzie watershed and that he was going back after he had taken in the worlds fair and got a whiff or two of civilization  faith  it may or may not remove mountains but it has certainly made the northland  no christian martyr ever possessed greater faith than did the pioneers of alaska  they never doubted the bleak and barren land  those who came remained and more ever came  they could not leave  they knew the gold was there and they persisted  somehow the romance of the land and the quest entered into their blood the spell of it gripped hold of them and would not let them go  man after man of them after the most terrible privation and suffering shook the muck of the country from his moccasins and departed for good  but the following spring always found him drifting down the yukon on the tail of the ice jams  jack mcquestion aptly vindicates the grip of the north  after a residence of thirty years he insists that the climate is delightful and declares that whenever he makes a trip to the states he is afflicted with homesickness  needless to say the north still has him and will keep tight hold of him until he dies  in fact for him to die elsewhere would be inartistic and insincere  of three of the pioneer pioneers jack mcquestion alone survives  in 1871 from one to seven years before holt went over chilcoot in the company of al mayo and arthur harper mcquestion came into the yukon from the northwest over the hudson bay company route from the mackenzie to fort yukon  the names of these three men as their lives are bound up in the history of the country and so long as there be histories and charts that long will the mayo and mcquestion rivers and the harper and ladue town site of dawson be remembered  as an agent of the alaska commercial company in 1873 mcquestion built fort reliance six miles below the klondike river  in 1898 the writer met jack mcquestion at minook on the lower yukon  the old pioneer though grizzled was hale and hearty and as optimistic as when he first journeyed into the land along the path of the circle  and no man more beloved is there in all the north  there will be great sadness there when his soul goes questing on over the last dividefarther north perhapswho can tell  frank dinsmore is a fair sample of the men who made the yukon country  a yankee born in auburn maine the wanderlust early laid him by the heels and at sixteen he was heading west on the trail that led farther north  he prospected in the black hills montana and in the coeur dalene then heard a whisper of the north and went up to juneau on the alaskan panhandle  but the north still whispered and more insistently and he could not rest till he went over chilcoot and down into the mysterious silent land  this was in 1882 and he went down the chain of lakes down the yukon up the pelly and tried his luck on the bars of mcmillan river  in the fall a perambulating skeleton he came back over the pass in a blizzard with a rag of shirt tattered overalls and a handful of raw flour  but he was unafraid  that winter he worked for a grubstake in juneau and the next spring found the heels of his moccasins turned towards salt water and his face toward chilcoot  this was repeated the next spring and the following spring and the spring after that until in 1885 he went over the pass for good  there was to be no return for him until he found the gold he sought  the years came and went but he remained true to his resolve  for eleven long years with snowshoe and canoe pickaxe and goldpan he wrote out his life on the face of the land  upper yukon middle yukon lower yukonhe prospected faithfully and well  his bed was anywhere  winter or summer he carried neither tent nor stove and his sixpound sleepingrobe of arctic hare was the warmest covering he was ever known to possess  rabbit tracks and salmon bellies were his diet with a vengeance for he depended largely on his rifle and fishingtackle  his endurance equalled his courage  on a wager he lifted thirteen fiftypound sacks of flour and walked off with them  winding up a sevenhundredmile trip on the ice with a fortymile run he came into camp at six oclock in the evening and found a squaw dance under way he should have been exhausted  anyway his muclucs were frozen stiff but he kicked them off and danced all night in stockingfeet  at the last fortune came to him  the quest was ended and he gathered up his gold and pulled for the outside  and his own end was as fitting as that of his quest  illness came upon him down in san francisco and his splendid life ebbed slowly out as he sat in his big easychair in the commercial hotel the yukoners home  the doctors came discussed consulted the while he matured more plans of northland adventure for the north still gripped him and would not let him go  he grew weaker day by day but each day he said tomorrow ill be all right  other oldtimers out on furlough came to see him  they wiped their eyes and swore under their breaths then entered and talked largely and jovially about going in with him over the trail when spring came  but there in the big easychair it was that his long trail ended and the life passed out of him still fixed on farther north  from the time of the first white man famine loomed black and gloomy over the land  it was chronic with the indians and eskimos it became chronic with the gold hunters  it was ever present and so it came about that life was commonly expressed in terms of grubwas measured by cups of flour  each winter eight months long the heroes of the frost faced starvation  it became the custom as fall drew on for partners to cut the cards or draw straws to determine which should hit the hazardous trail for salt water and which should remain and endure the hazardous darkness of the arctic night  there was never food enough to winter the whole population  the a c company worked hard to freight up the grub but the gold hunters came faster and dared more audaciously  when the a c company added a new sternwheeler to its fleet men said now we shall have plenty  but more gold hunters poured in over the passes to the south more voyageurs and fur traders forced a way through the rockies from the east more seal hunters and coast adventurers poled up from bering sea on the west more sailors deserted from the whaleships to the north and they all starved together in right brotherly fashion  more steamers were added but the tide of prospectors welled always in advance  then the n a t  t  company came upon the scene and both companies added steadily to their fleets  but it was the same old story famine would not depart  in fact famine grew with the population till in the winter of 18971898 the united states government was forced to equip a reindeer relief expedition  as of old that winter partners cut the cards and drew straws and remained or pulled for salt water as chance decided  they were wise of old time and had learned never to figure on relief expeditions  they had heard of such things but no mortal man of them had ever laid eyes on one  the hard luck of other mining countries pales into insignificance before the hard luck of the north  and as for the hardship it cannot be conveyed by printed page or word of mouth  no man may know who has not undergone  and those who have undergone out of their knowledge claim that in the making of the world god grew tired and when he came to the last barrowload just dumped it anyhow and that was how alaska happened to be  while no adequate conception of the life can be given to the stayathome yet the men themselves sometimes give a clue to its rigours  one old minook miner testified thus havent you noticed the expression on the faces of us fellows  you can tell a newcomer the minute you see him he looks alive enthusiastic perhaps jolly  we old miners are always grave unless were drinking  another oldtimer out of the bitterness of a homemood imagined himself a martian astronomer explaining to a friend with the aid of a powerful telescope the institutions of the earth  there are the continents he indicated and up there near the polar cap is a country frigid and burning and lonely and apart called alaska  now in other countries and states there are great insane asylums but though crowded they are insufficient so there is alaska given over to the worst cases now and then some poor insane creature comes to his senses in those awful solitudes and in wondering joy escapes from the land and hastens back to his home  but most cases are incurable  they just suffer along poor devils forgetting their former life quite or recalling it like a dream  again the grip of the north which will not let one gofor most cases are incurable  for a quarter of a century the battle with frost and famine went on  the very severity of the struggle with nature seemed to make the gold hunters kindly toward one another  the latchstring was always out and the open hand was the order of the day  distrust was unknown and it was no hyperbole for a man to take the last shirt off his back for a comrade most significant of all perhaps in this connection was the custom of the old days that when august the first came around the prospectors who had failed to locate pay dirt were permitted to go upon the ground of their more fortunate comrades and take out enough for the next years grubstake  in 1885 rich barwashing was done on the stewart river and in 1886 cassiar bar was struck just below the mouth of the hootalinqua  it was at this time that the first moderate strike was made on forty mile creek so called because it was judged to be that distance below fort reliance of jack mcquestion fame  a prospector named williams started for the outside with dogs and indians to carry the news but suffered such hardship on the summit of chilcoot that he was carried dying into the store of captain john healy at dyea  but he had brought the news throughcoarse gold  within three months more than two hundred miners had passed in over chilcoot stampeding for forty mile  find followed findsixty mile miller glacier birch franklin and the koyokuk  but they were all moderate discoveries and the miners still dreamed and searched for the fabled stream too much gold where gold was so plentiful that gravel had to be shovelled into the sluiceboxes in order to wash it  and all the time the northland was preparing to play its own huge joke it was a great joke albeit an exceeding bitter one and it has led the oldtimers to believe that the land is left in darkness the better part of the year because god goes away and leaves it to itself  after all the risk and toil and faithful endeavour it was destined that few of the heroes should be in at the finish when too much gold turned its yellowtreasure to the stars  first there was robert hendersonand this is true history  henderson had faith in the indian river district  for three years by himself depending mainly on his rifle living on straight meat a large portion of the time he prospected many of the indian river tributaries just missed finding the rich creeks sulphur and dominion and managed to make grub poor grub out of quartz creek and australia creek  then he crossed the divide between indian river and the klondike and on one of the feeders of the latter found eight cents to the pan  this was considered excellent in those simple days  naming the creek gold bottom he recrossed the divide and got three men munson dalton and swanson to return with him  the four took out 750  and be it emphasized and emphasized again that this was the first klondike gold ever shovelled in and washed out  and be it also emphasized that robert henderson was the discoverer of klondike all lies and hearsay tales to the contrary  running out of grub henderson again recrossed the divide and went down the indian river and up the yukon to sixty mile  here joe ladue ran the trading post and here joe ladue had originally grubstaked henderson henderson told his tale and a dozen men all it contained deserted the post for the scene of his find  also henderson persuaded a party of prospectors bound for stewart river to forgo their trip and go down and locate with him  he loaded his boat with supplies drifted down the yukon to the mouth of the klondike and towed and poled up the klondike to gold bottom  but at the mouth of the klondike he met george carmack and thereby hangs the tale  carmack was a squawman  he was familiarly known as siwash georgea derogatory term which had arisen out of his affinity for the indians  at the time henderson encountered him he was catching salmon with his indian wife and relatives on the site of what was to become dawson the golden city of the snows  henderson bubbling over with goodwill openhanded told carmack of his discovery  but carmack was satisfied where he was he was possessed by no overweening desire for the strenuous life  salmon were good enough for him  but henderson urged him to come on and locate until when he yielded he wanted to take the whole tribe along henderson refused to stand for this said that he must give the preference over siwashes to his old sixty mile friends and it is rumoured said some things about siwashes that were not nice  the next morning henderson went on alone up the klondike to gold bottom carmack by this time aroused took a short cut afoot for the same place accompanied by his two indian brothersinlaw skookum jim and tagish charley he went up rabbit creek now bonanza crossed into gold bottom and staked near hendersons discovery  on the way up he had panned a few shovels on rabbit creek and he showed henderson colours he had obtained  henderson made him promise if he found anything on the way back that he would send up one of the indians with the news  henderson also agreed to pay for his service for he seemed to feel that they were on the verge of something big and he wanted to make sure  carmack returned down rabbit creek  while he was taking a sleep on the bank about half a mile below the mouth of what was to be known as eldorado skookum jim tried his luck and from surface prospects got from ten cents to a dollar to the pan  carmack and his brotherinlaw staked and hit the high places for forty mile where they filed on the claims before captain constantine and renamed the creek bonanza  and henderson was forgotten  no word of it reached him  carmack broke his promise  weeks afterward when bonanza and eldorado were staked from end to end and there was no more room a party of late comers pushed over the divide and down to gold bottom where they found henderson still at work  when they told him they were from bonanza he was nonplussed  he had never heard of such a place  but when they described it he recognized it as rabbit creek  then they told him of its marvellous richness and as tappan adney relates when henderson realized what he had lost through carmacks treachery he threw down his shovel and went and sat on the bank so sick at heart that it was some time before he could speak  then there were the rest of the oldtimers the men of forty mile and circle city  at the time of the discovery nearly all of them were over to the west at work in the old diggings or prospecting for new ones  as they said of themselves they were the kind of men who are always caught out with forks when it rains soup  in the stampede that followed the news of carmacks strike very few old miners took part  they were not there to take part  but the men who did go on the stampede were mainly the worthless ones the newcomers and the camp hangers on  and while bob henderson plugged away to the east and the heroes plugged away to the west the greenhorns and rounders went up and staked bonanza  but the northland was not yet done with its joke  when fall came on and the heroes returned to forty mile and to circle city they listened calmly to the upriver tales of siwash discoveries and loafers prospects and shook their heads  they judged by the calibre of the men interested and branded it a bunco game  but glowing reports continued to trickle down the yukon and a few of the oldtimers went up to see they looked over the groundthe unlikeliest place for gold in all their experienceand they went down the river again leaving it to the swedes  again the northland turned the tables  the alaskan gold hunter is proverbial not so much for his unveracity as for his inability to tell the precise truth  in a country of exaggerations he likewise is prone to hyperbolic description of things actual  but when it came to klondike he could not stretch the truth as fast as the truth itself stretched  carmack first got a dollar pan  he lied when he said it was two dollars and a half  and when those who doubted him did get twoandahalf pans they said they were getting an ounce and lo ere the lie had fairly started on its way they were getting not one ounce but five ounces  this they claimed was six ounces but when they filled a pan of dirt to prove the lie they washed out twelve ounces  and so it went  they continued valiantly to lie but the truth continued to outrun them  but the northlands hyperborean laugh was not yet ended  when bonanza was staked from mouth to source those who had failed to get in disgruntled and sore went up the pups and feeders  eldorado was one of these feeders and many men after locating on it turned their backs upon their claims and never gave them a second thought  one man sold a halfinterest in five hundred feet of it for a sack of flour  other owners wandered around trying to bunco men into buying them out for a song  and then eldorado showed up  it was far far richer than bonanza with an average value of a thousand dollars a foot to every foot of it  a swede named charley anderson had been at work on miller creek the year of the strike and arrived in dawson with a few hundred dollars  two miners who had staked no 29 eldorado decided that he was the proper man upon whom to unload  he was too canny to approach sober so at considerable expense they got him drunk  even then it was hard work but they kept him befuddled for several days and finally inveigled him into buying no 29 for 750  when anderson sobered up he wept at his folly and pleaded to have his money back  but the men who had duped him were hardhearted  they laughed at him and kicked themselves for not having tapped him for a couple of hundred more  nothing remained for anderson but to work the worthless ground  this he did and out of it he took over threequarters of a million of dollars  it was not till frank dinsmore who already had big holdings on birch creek took a hand that the oldtimers developed faith in the new diggings  dinsmore received a letter from a man on the spot calling it the biggest thing in the world and harnessed his dogs and went up to investigate  and when he sent a letter back saying that he had never seen anything like it circle city for the first time believed and at once was precipitated one of the wildest stampedes the country had ever seen or ever will see  every dog was taken many went without dogs and even the women and children and weaklings hit the three hundred miles of ice through the long arctic night for the biggest thing in the world  it is related that but twenty people mostly cripples and unable to travel were left in circle city when the smoke of the last sled disappeared up the yukon  since that time gold has been discovered in all manner of places under the grass roots of the hillside benches in the bottom of monte cristo island and in the sands of the sea at nome  and now the gold hunter who knows his business shuns the favourable looking spots confident in his hardwon knowledge that he will find the most gold in the least likely place  this is sometimes adduced to support the theory that the gold hunters rather than the explorers are the men who will ultimately win to the pole  who knows  it is in their blood and they are capable of it  piedmont california february 1902     foma gordyeeff       what without asking hither hurried whence     and without asking whither hurried hence     oh many a cup of this forbidden wine     must drown the memory of that insolence  foma gordyeeff is a big booknot only is the breadth of russia in it but the expanse of life  yet though in each land in this

bitter one is essentially a russian in his grasp on the facts of life and in his treatment  all the russian selfanalysis and insistent introspection are his  and like all his brother russians ardent passionate protest impregnates his work  there is a purpose to it  he writes because he has something to say which the world should hear  from that clenched fist of his light and airy romances pretty and sweet and beguiling do not flow but realitiesyes big and brutal and repulsive but real  he raises the cry of the miserable and the despised and in a masterly arraignment of commercialism protests against social conditions against the grinding of the faces of the poor and weak and the selfpollution of the rich and strong in their mad lust for place and power  it is to be doubted strongly if the average bourgeois smug and fat and prosperous can understand this man foma gordyeeff  the rebellion in his blood is something to which their own does not thrill  to them it will be inexplicable that this man with his health and his millions could not go on living as his class lived keeping regular hours at desk and stock exchange driving close contracts underbidding his competitors and exulting in the business disasters of his fellows  it would appear so easy and after such a life well appointed and eminently respectable he could die  ah foma will interrupt rudelyhe is given to rude interruptionsif to die and disappear is the end of these moneygrubbing years why moneygrub  and the bourgeois whom he rudely interrupted will not understand  nor did mayakin understand as he laboured

environment into which he is born  ignat his father and mayakin the godfather and all the horde of successful merchants singing the paean of the strong and the praises of merciless remorseless laissez

do well to pity people ignat tells foma the boy only you must use judgment with your pity  first consider the man find out what he is like what use can be made of him and if you see that he is a strong and capable man help him if you like  but if a man is weak not inclined to workspit upon him and go your way  and you must know that when a man complains about everything and cries out and groanshe is not worth more than two kopeks he is not worthy of pity and will be of no use to you if you do help him  such the frank and militant commercialism bellowed out between glasses of strong liquor  now comes mayakin speaking softly and without satire  eh my boy what is a beggar  a beggar is a man who is forced by fate to remind us of christ he is christs brother he is the bell of the lord and rings in life for the purpose of awakening our conscience of stirring up the satiety of mans flesh  he stands under the window and sings for christs saake and by that chant he reminds us of christ of his holy command to help our neighbour  but men have so ordered their lives that it is utterly impossible for them to act in accordance with christs teaching and jesus christ has become entirely superfluous to us  not once but in all probability a thousand times we have given him over to be crucified but still we cannot banish him from our lives so long as his poor brethren sing his name in the streets and remind us of him  and so now we have hit upon the idea of shutting up the beggars in such special buildings so that they may not roam about the streets and stir up our consciences  but foma will have none of it  he is neither to be enticed nor cajoled the cry of his nature is for light  he must have light  and in burning revolt he goes seeking the meaning of life  his thoughts embraced all those petty people who toiled at hard labour  it was strangewhy did they live  what satisfaction was it to them to live on the earth  all they did was to perform their dirty arduous toil eat poorly they were miserably clad addicted to drunkenness  one was sixty years old but he still toiled side by side with young men  and they all presented themselves to fomas imagination as a huge heap of worms who were swarming over the earth merely to eat  he becomes the living interrogation of life  he cannot begin living until he knows what living means and he seeks its meaning vainly  why should i try to live life when i do not know what life is he objects when mayakin strives with him to return and manage his business  why should men fetch and carry for him be slaves to him and his money  work is not everything to a man he says it is not true that justification lies in work    some people never do any work at all all their lives longyet they live better than the toilers  why is that  and what justification have i  and how will all the people who give their orders justify themselves  what have they lived for  but my idea is that everybody ought without fail to know solidly what he is living for  is it possible that a man is born to toil accumulate money build a house beget children anddie  no life means something in itself     a man has been

vulgarity prince of ephemerals and idol of the unelectas a chicago critic chortlesis dead  it is true  he is dead dead and buried  and a fluttering chirping host of men little men and unseeing men have heaped him over with the uncut leaves of kim wrapped him in stalky  co for winding sheet and for headstone reared his unconventional lines the lesson  it was very easy  the simplest thing in the world  and the fluttering chirping gentlemen are rubbing their hands in amaze and wondering why they did not do it long ago it was so very very simple  but the centuries to come of which the fluttering chirping gentlemen are prone to talk largely will have something to say in the matter  and when they the future centuries quest back to the nineteenth century to find what manner of century it wasto find not what the people of the nineteenth century thought they thought but what they really thought not what they thought they ought to do but what they really did do then a certain man kipling will be readand read with understanding  they thought they read him with understanding those people of the nineteenth century the future centuries will say and then they thought there was no understanding in him and after that they did not know what they thought  but this is oversevere  it applies only to that class which serves a function somewhat similar to that served by the populace of old time in rome  this is the unstable mobminded mass which sits on the fence ever ready to fall this side or that and indecorously clamber back again which puts a democratic administration into office one election and a republican the next which discovers and lifts up a prophet today that it may stone him tomorrow which clamours for the book everybody else is reading for no reason under the sun save that everybody else is reading it  this is the class of whim and caprice of fad and vogue the unstable incoherent mobmouthed mobminded mass the monkeyfolk if you please of these latter days  now it may be reading the eternal city  yesterday it was reading the master christian and some several days before that it was reading kipling  yes almost to his shame be it these folk were reading him  but it was not his fault  if he depended upon them he well deserves to be dead and buried and never to rise again but to them let us be thankful he never lived  they thought he lived but he was as dead then as he is now and as he always will be  he could not help it because he became the vogue and it is easily understood  when he lay ill fighting with close grapples with death those who knew him were grieved  they were many and in many voices to the rim of the seven seas they spoke their grief  whereupon and with celerity the mobminded mass began to inquire as to this man whom so many mourned  if everybody else mourned it were fit that they mourn too  so a vast wail went up  each was a spur to the others grief and each began privately to read this man they had never read and publicly to proclaim this man they had always read  and straightaway next day they drowned their grief in a sea of historical romance and forgot all about him  the reaction was inevitable  emerging from the sea into which they had plunged they became aware that they had so soon forgotten him and would have been ashamed had not the fluttering chirping men said come let us bury him  and they put him in a hole quickly out of their sight  and when they have crept into their own little holes and smugly laid themselves down in their last long sleep the future centuries will roll the stone away and he will come forth again  for be it known that man of us is imperishable who makes his century imperishable  that man of us who seizes upon the salient facts of our life who tells what we thought what we were and for what we stoodthat man shall be the mouthpiece to the centuries and so long as they listen he shall endure  we remember the caveman  we remember him because he made his century imperishable  but unhappily we remember him dimly in a collective sort of way because he memorialized his century dimly in a collective sort of way  he had no written speech so he left us rude scratchings of beasts and things cracked marrowbones and weapons of stone  it was the best expression of which he was capable  had he scratched his own particular name with the scratchings of beasts and things stamped his cracked marrowbones with his own particular seal trademarked his weapons of stone with his own particular device that particular man would we remember  but he did the best he could and we remember him as best we may  homer takes his place with achilles and the greek and trojan heroes because he remembered them we remember him  whether he be one or a dozen men or a dozen generations of men we remember him  and so long as the name of greece is known on the lips of men so long will the name of homer be known  there are many such names linked with their times which have come down to us many more which will yet go down and to them in token that we have lived must we add some few of our own  dealing only with the artist be it understood only those artists will go down who have spoken true of us  their truth must be the deepest and most significant their voices clear and strong definite and coherent halftruths and partialtruths will not do nor will thin piping voices and quavering lays  there must be the cosmic quality in what they sing they must seize upon and press into enduring artforms the vital facts of our existence  they must tell why we have lived for without any reason for living depend upon it in the time to come it will be as though we had never lived  nor are the things that were true of the people a thousand years or so ago true of us today  the romance of homers greece is the romance of homers greece  that is undeniable  it is not our romance  and he who in our time sings the romance of homers greece cannot expect to sing it so well as homer did nor will he be singing about us or our romance at all  a machine age is something quite different from an heroic age  what is true of rapidfire guns stockexchanges and electric motors cannot possibly be true of handflung javelins and whirring chariot wheels  kipling knows this  he has been telling it to us all his life living it all his life in the work he has done  what the anglosaxon has done he has memorialized  and by anglosaxon is not meant merely the people of that tight little island on the edge of the western ocean  anglosaxon stands for the englishspeaking people of all the world who in forms and institutions and traditions are more peculiarly and definitely english than anything else  this people kipling has sung  their sweat and blood and toil have been the motives of his songs but underlying all the motives of his songs is the motive of motives the sum of them all and something more which is one with what underlies all the anglosaxon sweat and blood and toil namely the genius of the race  and this is the cosmic quality  both that which is true of the race for all time and that which is true of the race for all time applied to this particular time he has caught up and pressed into his artforms  he has caught the dominant note of the anglosaxon and pressed it into wonderful rhythms which cannot be sung out in a day and which will not be sung out in a day  the anglosaxon is a pirate a land robber and a sea robber  underneath his thin coating of culture he is what he was in morgans time in drakes time in williams time in alfreds time  the blood and the tradition of hengist and horsa are in his veins  in battle he is subject to the bloodlusts of the berserkers of old  plunder and booty fascinate him immeasurably  the schoolboy of today dreams the dream of clive and hastings  the anglosaxon is strong of arm and heavy of hand and he possesses a primitive brutality all his own  there is a discontent in his blood an unsatisfaction that will not let him rest but sends him adventuring over the sea and among the lands in the midst of the sea  he does not know when he is beaten wherefore the term bulldog is attached to him so that all may know his unreasonableness  he has some care as to the purity of his ways does not wish for strange gods nor juggle with intellectual phantasmagoria  he loves freedom but is dictatorial to others is selfwilled has boundless energy and does things for himself  he is also a master of matter an organizer of law and an administrator of justice  and in the nineteenth century he has lived up to his reputation  being the nineteenth century and no other century and in so far different from all other centuries he has expressed himself differently  but blood will tell and in the name of god the bible and democracy he has gone out over the earth possessing himself of broad lands and fat revenues and conquering by virtue of his sheer pluck and enterprise and superior machinery  now the future centuries seeking to find out what the nineteenth century anglosaxon was and what were his works will have small concern with what he did not do and what he would have liked to do  these things he did do and for these things will he be remembered  his claim on posterity will be that in the nineteenth century he mastered matter his twentiethcentury claim will be in the highest probability that he organized lifebut that will be sung by the twentiethcentury kiplings or the twentyfirstcentury kiplings  rudyard kipling of the nineteenth century has sung of things as they are  he has seen life as it is taken it up squarely in both his hands and looked upon it  what better preachment upon the anglosaxon and what he has done can be had than the bridge builders what better appraisement than the white mans burden  as for faith and clean idealsnot of children and gods but men in a world of menwho has preached them better than he  primarily kipling has stood for the doer as opposed to the dreamerthe doer who lists not to idle songs of empty days but who goes forth and does things with bended back and sweated brow and workhardened hands the most characteristic thing about kipling is his lover of actuality his intense practicality his proper and necessary respect for the hardheaded hardfisted fact  and above all he has preached the gospel of work and as potently as carlyle ever preached  for he has preached it not only to those in the high places but to the common men to the great sweating thong of common men who hear and understand yet stand agape at carlyles turgid utterance  do the thing to your hand and do it with all your might  never mind what the thing is so long as it is something  do it  do it and remember tomlinson sexless and soulless tomlinson who was denied at heavens gate  the blundering centuries have perseveringly pottered and groped through the dark but it remained for kiplings century to roll in the sun to formulate in other words the reign of law  and of the artists in kiplings century he of them all has driven the greater measure of law in the more consummate speech      keep ye the lawbe swift in all obedience     clear the land of evil drive the road and bridge the ford        make ye sure to each his own        that he reap what he hath sown     by the peace among our peoples let men know we serve the lord  and so it runs from mcandrews law order duty and restraint to his last least line whether of the vampire or the recessional  and no prophet out of israel has cried out more loudly the sins of the people nor called them more awfully to repent  but he is vulgar he stirs the puddle of life object the fluttering chirping gentlemen the tomlinsonian men  well and isnt life vulgar can you divorce the facts of life  much of good is there and much of ill but who may draw aside his garment and say i am none of them can you say that the part is greater than the whole that the whole is more or less than the sum of the parts  as for the puddle of life the stench is offensive to you  well and what then  do you not live in it why do you not make it clean  do you clamour for a filter to make clean only your own particular portion  and made clean are you wroth because kipling has stirred it muddy again  at least he has stirred it healthily with steady vigour and goodwill  he has not brought to the surface merely its dregs but its most significant values  he has told the centuries to come of our lyings and our lusts but he has also told the centuries to come of the seriousness which is underneath our lyings and our lusts  and he has told us too and always has he told us to be clean and strong and to walk upright and manlike  but he has no sympathy the fluttering gentlemen chirp  we admire his art and intellectual brilliancy we all admire his art and intellectual brilliancy his dazzling technique and rare rhythmical sense but    he is totally devoid of sympathy  dear  dear  what is to be understood by this  should he sprinkle his pages with sympathetic adjectives so many to the paragraph as the country compositor sprinkles commas  surely not  the little gentlemen are not quite so infinitesimal as that  there have been many tellers of jokes and the greater of them it is recorded never smiled at their own not even in the crucial moment when the audience wavered between laughter and tears  and so with kipling  take the vampire for instance  it has been complained that there is no touch of pity in it for the man and his ruin no sermon on the lesson of it no compassion for the human weakness no indignation at the heartlessness  but are we kindergarten children that the tale be told to us in words of one syllable  or are we men and women able to read between the lines what kipling intended we should read between the lines  for some of him lived but the most of him died  is there not here all the excitation in the world for our sorrow our pity our indignation  and what more is the function of art than to excite states of consciousness complementary to the thing portrayed  the colour of tragedy is red  must the artist also paint in the watery tears and wanfaced grief  for some of him lived but the most of him diedcan the heartache of the situation be conveyed more achingly  or were it better that the young man some of him alive but most of him dead should come out before the curtain and deliver a homily to the weeping audience  the nineteenth century so far as the anglosaxon is concerned was remarkable for two great developments the mastery of matter and the expansion of the race  three great forces operated in it nationalism commercialism democracythe marshalling of the races the merciless remorseless laissez faire of the dominant bourgeoisie and the practical actual working government of men within a very limited equality  the democracy of the nineteenth century is not the democracy of which the eighteenth century dreamed  it is not the democracy of the declaration but it is what we have practised and lived that reconciles it to the fact of the lesser breeds without the law  it is of these developments and forces of the nineteenth century that kipling has sung  and the romance of it he has sung that which underlies and transcends objective endeavour which deals with race impulses race deeds and race traditions  even into the steamladen speech of his locomotives has he breathed our life our spirit our significance  as he is our mouthpiece so are they his mouthpieces  and the romance of the nineteenthcentury man as he has thus expressed himself in the nineteenth century in shaft and wheel in steel and steam in far journeying and adventuring kipling has caught up in wondrous songs for the future centuries to sing  if the nineteenth century is the century of the hooligan then is kipling the voice of the hooligan as surely as he is the voice of the nineteenth century  who is more representative  is david harum more representative of the nineteenth century  is mary johnston charles major or winston churchill  is bret harte  william dean howells gilbert parker  who of them all is as essentially representative of nineteenthcentury life  when kipling is forgotten will robert louis stevenson be remembered for his dr jekyll and mr hyde his kidnapped and his david balfour  not so  his treasure island will be a classic to go down with robinson crusoe through the lookingglass and the jungle books  he will be remembered for his essays for his letters for his philosophy of life for himself  he will be the well beloved as he has been the well beloved  but his will be another claim upon posterity than what we are considering  for each epoch has its singer  as scott sang the swan song of chivalry and dickens the burgherfear of the rising merchant class so kipling as no one else has sung the hymn of the dominant bourgeoisie the war march of the white man round the world the triumphant paean of commercialism and imperialism  for that will he be remembered  oakland california october 1901     the other animals   american journalism has its moments of fantastic hysteria and when it is on the rampage the only thing for a rational man to do is to climb a tree and let the cataclysm go by  and so some time ago when the word naturefaker was coined i for one climbed into my tree and stayed there  i happened to be in hawaii at the time and a honolulu reporter elicited the sentiment from me that i thanked god i was not an authority on anything  this sentiment was promptly cabled to america in an associated press despatch whereupon the american press possibly annoyed because i had not climbed down out of my tree charged me with paying for advertising by cable at a dollar per wordthe very human way of the american press which when a man refuses to come down and be licked makes faces at him  but now that the storm is over let us come and reason together  i have been guilty of writing two animalstoriestwo books about dogs  the writing of these two stories on my part was in truth a protest against the humanizing of animals of which it seemed to me several animal writers had been profoundly guilty  time and again and many times in my narratives i wrote speaking of my dogheroes he did not think these things he merely did them etc  and i did this repeatedly to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons and i did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dogheroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning but by instinct sensation and emotion and by simple reasoning  also i endeavoured to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution i hewed them to the mark set by scientific research and awoke one day to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the naturefakers  president roosevelt was responsible for this and he tried to condemn me on two counts  1 i was guilty of having a big fighting bulldog whip a wolfdog  2 i was guilty of allowing a lynx to kill a wolfdog in a pitched battle  regarding the second count president roosevelt was wrong in his field observations taken while reading my book  he must have read it hastily for in my story i had the wolfdog kill the lynx not only did i have my wolfdog kill the lynx but i made him eat the body of the lynx as well  remains only the first count on which to convict me of naturefaking and the first count does not charge me with diverging from ascertained facts  it is merely a statement of a difference of opinion  president roosevelt does not think a bulldog can lick a wolfdog  i think a bulldog can lick a wolfdog  and there we are  difference of opinion may make and does make horseracing  i can understand that difference of opinion can make dogfighting  but what gets me is how difference of opinion regarding the relative fighting merits of a bulldog and a wolfdog makes me a naturefaker and president roosevelt a vindicated and triumphant scientist  then entered john burroughs to clinch president roosevelts judgments in this alliance there is no difference of opinion  that roosevelt can do no wrong is burroughss opinion and that burroughs is always right is roosevelts opinion  both are agreed that animals do not reason  they assert that all animals below man are automatons and perform actions only of two sortsmechanical and reflexand that in such actions no reasoning enters at all  they believe that man is the only animal capable of reasoning and that ever does reason  this is a view that makes the twentiethcentury scientist smile  it is not modern at all it is distinctly mediaeval  president roosevelt and john burroughs in advancing such a view are homocentric in the same fashion that the scholastics of earlier and darker centuries were homocentric  had the world not been discovered to be round until after the births of president roosevelt and john burroughs they would have been geocentric as well in their theories of the cosmos  they could not have believed otherwise the stuff of their minds is so conditioned  they talk the argot of evolution while they no more understand the essence and the import of evolution than does a south sea islander or sir oliver lodge understand the noumena of radioactivity  now president roosevelt is an amateur  he may know something of statecraft and of biggame shooting he may be able to kill a deer when he sees it and to measure it and weigh it after he has shot it he may be able to observe carefully and accurately the actions and antics of tomtits and snipe and after he has observed it definitely and coherently to convey the information of when the first chipmunk in a certain year and a certain latitude and longitude came out in the spring and chattered and gambolledbut that he should be able as an individual observer to analyze all animal life and to synthetize and develop all that is known of the method and significance of evolution would require a vaster credulity for you or me to believe than is required for us to believe the biggest whopper ever told by an unmitigated naturefaker no president roosevelt does not understand evolution and he does not seem to have made much of an attempt to understand evolution  remains john burroughs who claims to be a thoroughgoing evolutionist now it is rather hard for a young man to tackle an old man  it is the nature of young men to be more controlled in such matters and it is the nature of old men presuming upon the wisdom that is very often erroneously associated with age to do the tackling  in this present question of naturefaking the old men did the tackling while i as one young man kept quiet a long time  but here goes at last  and first of all let mr burroughss position be stated and stated in his words  why impute reason to an animal if its behaviour can be explained on the theory of instinct  remember these words for they will be referred to later  a goodly number of persons seem to have persuaded themselves that animals do reason  but instinct suffices for the animals    they get along very well without reason  darwin tried hard to convince himself that animals do at times reason in a rudimentary way but darwin was also a much greater naturalist than psychologist  the preceding quotation is tantamount on mr burroughss part to a flat denial that animals reason even in a rudimentary way  and when mr burrough denies that animals reason even in a rudimentary way it is equivalent to affirming in accord with the first quotation in this paragraph that instinct will explain every animal act that might be confounded with reason by the unskilled or careless observer  having bitten off this large mouthful mr burroughs proceeds with serene and beautiful satisfaction to masticate it in the following fashion  he cites a large number of instances of purely instinctive actions on the part of animals and triumphantly demands if they are acts of reason  he tells of the robin that fought day after day its reflected image in a windowpane of the birds in south america that were guilty of drilling clear through a mud wall which they mistook for a solid clay bank of the beaver that cut down a tree four times because it was held at the top by the branches of other trees of the cow that licked the skin of her stuffed calf so affectionately that it came apart whereupon she proceeded to eat the hay with which it was stuffed  he tells of the phoebebird that betrays her nest on the porch by trying to hide it with moss in similar fashion to the way all phoebebirds hide their nests when they are built among rocks  he tells of the highhole that repeatedly drills through the clapboards of an empty house in a vain attempt to find a thickness of wood deep enough in which to build its nest  he tells of the migrating lemmings of norway that plunge into the sea and drown in vast numbers because of their instinct to swim lakes and rivers in the course of their migrations  and having told a few more instances of like kidney he triumphantly demands where now is your muchvaunted reasoning of the lower animals  no schoolboy in a class debate could be guilty of unfairer argument  it is equivalent to replying to the assertion that 224 by saying no because 1243 i have demonstrated my honourable opponents error when a man attacks your ability as a footracer promptly prove to him that he was drunk the week before last and the average man in the crowd of gaping listeners will believe that you have convincingly refuted the slander on your fleetness of foot  on my honour it will work  try it some time  it is done every day  mr burroughs has done it himself and i doubt not pulled the sophistical wool over a great many pairs of eyes  no no mr burroughs you cant disprove that animals reason by proving that they possess instincts  but the worst of it is that you have at the same time pulled the wool over your own eyes  you have set up a straw man and knocked the stuffing out of him in the complacent belief that it was the reasoning of lower animals you were knocking out of the minds of those who disagreed with you  when the highhole perforated the icehouse and let out the sawdust you called him a lunatic     but let us be charitableand serious  what mr burroughs instances as acts of instinct certainly are acts of instincts  by the same method of logic one could easily adduce a multitude of instinctive acts on the part of man and thereby prove that man is an unreasoning animal  but man performs actions of both sorts  between man and the lower animals mr burroughs finds a vast gulf  this gulf divides man from the rest of his kin by virtue of the power of reason that he alone possesses  man is a voluntary agent  animals are automatons  the robin fights its reflection in the windowpane because it is his instinct to fight and because he cannot reason out the physical laws that make this reflection appear real  an animal is a mechanism that operates according to foreordained rules  wrapped up in its heredity and determined long before it was born is a certain limited capacity of ganglionic response to eternal stimuli  these responses have been fixed in the species through adaptation to environment  natural selection has compelled the animal automatically to respond in a fixed manner and a certain way to all the usual external stimuli it encounters in the course of a usual life  thus under usual circumstances it does the usual thing  under unusual circumstances it still does the usual thing wherefore the highhole perforating the icehouse is guilty of lunacyof unreason in short  to do the unusual thing under unusual circumstances successfully to adjust to a strange environment for which his heredity has not automatically fitted an adjustment mr burroughs says is impossible  he says it is impossible because it would be a noninstinctive act and as is well known animals act only through instinct  and right here we catch a glimpse of mr burroughss cart standing before his horse  he has a thesis and though the heavens fall he will fit the facts to the thesis agassiz in his opposition to evolution had a similar thesis though neither did he fit the facts to it nor did the heavens fall  facts are very disagreeable at times  but let us see  let us test mr burroughss test of reason and instinct when i was a small boy i had a dog named rollo  according to mr burroughs rollo was an automaton responding to external stimuli mechanically as directed by his instincts  now as is well known the development of instinct in animals is a dreadfully slow process  there is no known case of the development of a single instinct in domestic animals in all the history of their domestication  whatever instincts they possess they brought with them from the wild thousands of years ago therefore all rollos actions were ganglionic discharges mechanically determined by the instincts that had been developed and fixed in the species thousands of years ago  very well  it is clear therefore that in all his play with me he would act in oldfashioned ways adjusting himself to the physical and psychical factors in his environment according to the rules of adjustment which had obtained in the wild and which had become part of his heredity  rollo and i did a great deal of rough romping  he chased me and i chased him  he nipped my legs arms and hands often so hard that i yelled while i rolled him and tumbled him and dragged him about often so strenuously as to make him yelp  in the course of the play many variations arose  i would make believe to sit down and cry  all repentance and anxiety he would wag his tail and lick my face whereupon i would give him the laugh  he hated to be laughed at and promptly he would spring for me with goodnatured menacing jaws and the wild romp would go on  i had scored a point  then he hit upon a trick  pursuing him into the woodshed i would find him in a far corner pretending to sulk  now he dearly loved the play and never got enough of it  but at first he fooled me  i thought i had somehow hurt his feelings and i came and knelt before him petting him and speaking lovingly  promptly in a wild outburst he was up and away tumbling me over on the floor as he dashed out in a mad skurry around the yard  he had scored a point  after a time it became largely a game of wits  i reasoned my acts of course while his were instinctive  one day as he pretended to sulk in the corner i glanced out of the woodshed doorway simulated pleasure in face voice and language and greeted one of my schoolboy friends immediately rollo forgot to sulk rushed out to see the newcomer and saw empty space  the laugh was on him and he knew it and i gave it to him too  i fooled him in this way two or three times then be became wise one day i worked a variation  suddenly looking out the door making believe that my eyes had been attracted by a moving form i said coldly as a child educated in turning away billcollectors would say no my father is not at home  like a shot rollo was out the door  he even ran down the alley to the front of the house in a vain attempt to find the man i had addressed  he came back sheepishly to endure the laugh and resume the game  and now we come to the test  i fooled rollo but how was the fooling made possible  what precisely went on in that brain of his  according to mr burroughs who denies even rudimentary reasoning to the lower animals rollo acted instinctively mechanically responding to the external stimulus furnished by me which led him to believe that a man was outside the door  since rollo acted instinctively and since all instincts are very ancient tracing back to the predomestication period we can conclude only that rollos wild ancestors at the time this particular instinct was fixed into the heredity of the species must have been in close longcontinued and vital contact with man the voice of man and the expressions on the face of man  but since the instinct must have been developed during the predomestication period how under the sun could his wild undomesticated ancestors have experienced the close longcontinued and vital contact with man  mr burroughs says that instinct suffices for the animals that they get along very well without reason  but i say what all the poor naturefakers will say that rollo reasoned  he was born into the world a bundle of instincts and a pinch of brainstuff all wrapped around in a framework of bone meat and hide  as he adjusted to his environment he gained experiences  he remembered these experiences  he learned that he mustnt chase the cat kill chickens nor bite little girls dresses  he learned that little boys had little boy playmates  he learned that men came into back yards  he learned that the animal man on meeting with his own kind was given to verbal and facial greeting  he learned that when a boy greeted a playmate he did it differently from the way he greeted a man  all these he learned and remembered  they were so many observationsso many propositions if you please  now what went on behind those brown eyes of his inside that pinch of brainstuff when i turned suddenly to the door and greeted an imaginary person outside instantly out of the thousands of observations stored in his brain came to the front of his consciousness the particular observations connected with this particular situation  next he established a relation between these observations  this relation was his conclusion achieved as every psychologist will agree by a definite cellaction of his grey matter from the fact that his master turned suddenly toward the door and from the fact that his masters voice facial expression and whole demeanour expressed surprise and delight he concluded that a friend was outside he established a relation between various things and the act of establishing relations between things is an act of reasonof rudimentary reason granted but none the less of reason  of course rollo was fooled  but that is no call for us to throw chests about it  how often has every last one of us been fooled in precisely similar fashion by another who turned and suddenly addressed an imaginary intruder  here is a case in point that occurred in the west  a robber had held up a railroad train  he stood in the aisle between the seats his revolver presented at the head of the conductor who stood facing him  the conductor was at his mercy  but the conductor suddenly looked over the robbers shoulder at the same time saying aloud to an imaginary person standing at the robbers back dont shoot him  like a flash the robber whirled about to confront this new danger and like a flash the conductor shot him down  show me mr burroughs where the mental process in the robbers brain was a shade different from the mental processes in rollos brain and ill quit naturefaking and join the trappists  surely when a mans mental process and a dogs mental process are precisely similar the muchvaunted gulf of mr burroughss fancy has been bridged  i had a dog in oakland  his name was glen  his father was brown a wolfdog that had been brought down from alaska and his mother was a halfwild mountain shepherd dog  neither father nor mother had had any experience with automobiles  glen came from the country a halfgrown puppy to live in oakland  immediately he became infatuated with an automobile  he reached the culmination of happiness when he was permitted to sit up in the front seat alongside the chauffeur  he would spend a whole day at a time on an automobile debauch even going without food  often the machine started directly from inside the barn dashed out the driveway without stopping and was gone  glen got left behind several times  the custom was established that whoever was taking the machine out should toot the horn before starting  glen learned the signal  no matter where he was or what he was doing when that horn tooted he was off for the barn and up into the front seat  one morning while glen was on the back porch eating his breakfast of mush and milk the chauffeur tooted  glen rushed down the steps into the barn and took his front seat the mush and milk dripping down his excited and happy chops  in passing i may point out that in thus forsaking his breakfast for the automobile he was displaying what is called the power of choicea peculiarly lordly attribute that according to mr burroughs belongs to man alone  yet glen made his choice between food and fun  it was not that glen wanted his breakfast less but that he wanted his ride more  the toot was only a joke  the automobile did not start glen waited and watched  evidently he saw no signs of an immediate start for finally he jumped out of the seat and went back to his breakfast  he ate with indecent haste like a man anxious to catch a train  again the horn tooted again he deserted his breakfast and again he sat in the seat and waited vainly for the machine to go  they came close to spoiling glens breakfast for him for he was kept on the jump between porch and barn  then he grew wise  they tooted the horn loudly and insistently but he stayed by his breakfast and finished it  thus once more did he display power of choice incidentally of control for when that horn tooted it was all he could do to refrain from running for the barn  the naturefaker would analyze what went on in glens brain somewhat in the following fashion  he had had in his short life experiences that not one of all his ancestors had ever had  he had learned that automobiles went fast that once in motion it was impossible for him to get on board that the toot of the horn was a noise that was peculiar to automobiles  these were so many propositions  now reasoning can be defined as the act or process of the brain by which from propositions known or assumed new propositions are reached  out of the propositions which i have shown were glens and which had become his through the medium of his own observation of the phenomena of life he made the new proposition that when the horn tooted it was time for him to get on board  but on the morning i have described the chauffeur fooled glen  somehow and much to his own disgust his reasoning was erroneous  the machine did not start after all  but to reason incorrectly is very human  the great trouble in all acts of reasoning is to include all the propositions in the problem  glen had included every proposition but one namely the human proposition the joke in the brain of the chauffeur  for a number of times glen was fooled  then he performed another mental act  in his problem he included the human proposition the joke in the brain of the chauffeur and he reached the new conclusion that when the horn tooted the automobile was not going to start  basing his action on this conclusion he remained on the porch and finished his breakfast  you and i and even mr burroughs perform acts of reasoning precisely similar to this every day in our lives  how mr burroughs will explain glens action by the instinctive theory is beyond me  in wildest fantasy even my brain refuses to follow mr burroughs into the primeval forest where glens dim ancestors to the tooting of automobile horns were fixing into the heredity of the breed the particular instinct that would enable glen a few thousand years later capably to cope with automobiles  dr c j romanes tells of a female chimpanzee who was taught to count straws up to five  she held the straws in her hand exposing the ends to the number requested  if she were asked for three she held up three if she were asked for four she held up four  all this is a mere matter of training  but consider now mr burroughs what follows  when she was asked for five straws and she had only four she doubled one straw exposing both its ends and thus making up the required number  she did not do this only once and by accident  she did it whenever more straws were asked for than she possessed  did she perform a distinctly reasoning act or was her action the result of blind mechanical instinct  if mr burroughs cannot answer to his own satisfaction he may call dr romanes a naturefaker and dismiss the incident from his mind  the foregoing is a trick of erroneous human reasoning that works very successfully in the united states these days  it is certainly a trick of mr burroughs of which he is guilty with distressing frequency  when a poor devil of a writer records what he has seen and when what he has seen does not agree with mr burroughss mediaeval theory he calls said writer a naturefaker  when a man like mr hornaday comes along mr burroughs works a variation of the trick on him  mr hornaday has made a close study of the orang in captivity and of the orang in its native state  also he has studied closely many other of the higher animal types  also in the tropics he has studied the lower types of man  mr hornaday is a man of experience and reputation  when he was asked if animals reasoned out of all his knowledge on the subject he replied that to ask him such a question was equivalent to asking him if fishes swim now mr burroughs has not had much experience in studying the lower human types and the higher animal types  living in a rural district in the state of new york and studying principally birds in that limited habitat he has been in contact neither with the higher animal types nor the lower human types  but mr hornadays reply is such a facer to him and his homocentric theory that he has to do something  and he does it he retorts i suspect that mr hornaday is a better naturalist than he is a comparative psychologist  exit mr hornaday  who the devil is mr hornaday anyway  the sage of slabsides has spoken  when darwin concluded that animals were capable of reasoning in a rudimentary way mr burroughs laid him out in the same fashion by saying but darwin was also a much greater naturalist than psychologistand this despite darwins long life of laborious research that was not wholly confined to a rural district such as mr burroughs inhabits in new york  mr burroughss method of argument is beautiful  it reminds one of the man whose pronunciation was vile but who said damn the dictionary aint i here  and now we come to the mental processes of mr burroughsto the psychology of the ego if you please  mr burroughs has troubles of his own with the dictionary  he violates language from the standpoint both of logic and science  language is a tool and definitions embodied in language should agree with the facts and history of life  but mr burroughss definitions do not so agree  this in turn is not the fault of his education but of his ego  to him despite his wellexploited and patronizing devotion to them the lower animals are disgustingly low  to him affinity and kinship with the other animals is a repugnant thing he will have none of it  he is too glorious a personality not to have between him and the other animals a vast and impassable gulf  the cause of mr burroughss mediaeval view of the other animals is to be found not in his knowledge of those other animals but in the suggestion of his selfexalted ego  in short mr burroughss homocentric theory has been developed out of his homocentric ego and by the misuse of language he strives to make the facts of life agree with his theory  after the instances i have cited of actions of animals which are impossible of explanation as due to instinct mr burroughs may reply your instances are easily explained by the simple law of association to this i reply first then why did you deny rudimentary reason to animals and why did you state flatly that instinct suffices for the animals  and second with great reluctance and with overwhelming humility because of my youth i suggest that you do not know exactly what you do mean by that phrase the simple law of association  your trouble i repeat is with definitions  you have grasped that man performs what is called abstract reasoning you have made a definition of abstract reason and betrayed by that great maker of theories the ego you have come to think that all reasoning is abstract and that what is not abstract reason is not reason at all  this is your attitude toward rudimentary reason  such a process in one of the other animals must be either abstract or it is not a reasoning process  your intelligence tells you that such a process is not abstract reasoning and your homocentric thesis compels you to conclude that it can be only a mechanical instinctive process  definitions must agree not with egos but with life  mr burroughs goes on the basis that a definition is something hard and fast absolute and eternal  he forgets that all the universe is in flux that definitions are arbitrary and ephemeral that they fix for a fleeting instant of time things that in the past were not that in the future will be not that out of the past become and that out of the present pass on to the future and become other things  definitions cannot rule life definitions cannot be made to rule life  life must rule definitions or else the definitions perish  mr burroughs forgets the evolution of reason  he makes a definition of reason without regard to its history and that definition is of reason purely abstract  human reason as we know it today is not a creation but a growth  its history goes back to the primordial slime that was quick with muddy life its history goes back to the first vitalized inorganic  and here are the steps of its ascent from the mud to man simple reflex action compound reflex action memory habit rudimentary reason and abstract reason  in the course of the climb thanks to natural selection instinct was evolved  habit is a development in the individual  instinct is a racehabit  instinct is blind unreasoning mechanical  this was the dividing of the ways in the climb of aspiring life  the perfect culmination of instinct we find in the antheap and the beehive  instinct proved a blind alley  but the other path that of reason led on and on even to mr burroughs and you and me  there are no impassable gulfs unless one chooses as mr burroughs does to ignore the lower human types and the higher animal types and to compare human mind with bird mind  it was impossible for life to reason abstractly until speech was developed  equipped with swords with tools of thought in short the slow development of the power to reason in the abstract went on  the lowest human types do little or no reasoning in the abstract  with every word with every increase in the complexity of thought with every ascertained fact so gained went on action and reaction in the grey matter of the speech discoverer and slowly step by step through hundreds of thousands of years developed the power of reason  place a honeybee in a glass bottle  turn the bottom of the bottle toward a lighted lamp so that the open mouth is away from the lamp vainly ceaselessly a thousand times undeterred by the bafflement and the pain the bee will hurl himself against the bottom of the bottle as he strives to win to the light  that is instinct  place your dog in a back yard and go away  he is your dog  he loves you  he yearns toward you as the bee yearns toward the light  he listens to your departing footsteps  but the fence is too high  then he turns his back upon the direction in which you are departing and runs around the yard  he is frantic with affection and desire  but he is not blind  he is observant  he is looking for a hole under the fence or through the fence or for a place where the fence is not so high  he sees a drygoods box standing against the fence  presto  he leaps upon it goes over the barrier and tears down the street to overtake you  is that instinct  here in the household where i am writing this is a little tahitian feedingchild  he believes firmly that a tiny dwarf resides in the box of my talkingmachine and that it is the tiny dwarf who does the singing and the talking  not even mr burroughs will affirm that the child has reached this conclusion by an instinctive process  of course the child reasons the existence of the dwarf in the box  how else could the box talk and sing  in that childs limited experience it has never encountered a single instance where speech and song were produced otherwise than by direct human agency  i doubt not that the dog is considerably surprised when he hears his masters voice coming out of a box  the adult savage on his first introduction to a telephone rushes around to the adjoining room to find the man who is talking through the partition  is this act instinctive  no  out of his limited experience out of his limited knowledge of physics he reasons that the only explanation possible is that a man is in the other room talking through the partition  but that savage cannot be fooled by a handmirror  we must go lower down in the animal scale to the monkey  the monkey swiftly learns that the monkey it sees is not in the glass wherefore it reaches craftily behind the glass  is this instinct  no  it is rudimentary reasoning  lower than the monkey in the scale of brain is the robin and the robin fights its reflection in the windowpane  now climb with me for a space  from the robin to the monkey where is the impassable gulf and where is the impassable gulf between the monkey and the feedingchild between the feedingchild and the savage who seeks the man behind the partition ay and between the savage and the astute financiers mrs chadwick fooled and the thousands who were fooled by the keeley motor swindle  let us be very humble  we who are so very human are very animal kinship with the other animals is no more repugnant to mr burroughs than was the heliocentric theory to the priests who compelled galileo to recant  not correct human reason not the evidence of the ascertained fact but pride of ego was responsible for the repugnance  in his stiffnecked pride mr burroughs runs a hazard more humiliating to that pride than any amount of kinship with the other animals  when a dog exhibits choice direction control and reason when it is shown that certain mental processes in that dogs brain are precisely duplicated in the brain of man and when mr burroughs convincingly proves that every action of the dog is mechanical and automaticthen by precisely the same arguments can it be proved that the similar actions of man are mechanical and automatic  no mr burroughs though you stand on the top of the ladder of life you must not kick out that ladder from under your feet  you must not deny your relatives the other animals their history is your history and if you kick them to the bottom of the abyss to the bottom of the abyss you go yourself  by them you stand or fall  what you repudiate in them you repudiate in yourselfa pretty spectacle truly of an exalted animal striving to disown the stuff of life out of which it is made striving by use of the very reason that was developed by evolution to deny the possession of evolution that developed it  this may be good egotism but it is not good science  papeete tahiti march 1908     the yellow peril   no more marked contrast appears in passing from our western land to the paper houses and cherry blossoms of japan than appears in passing from korea to china  to achieve a correct appreciation of the chinese the traveller should first sojourn amongst the koreans for several months and then one fine day cross over the yalu into manchuria  it would be of exceptional advantage to the correctness of appreciation did he cross over the yalu on the heels of a hostile and alien army  war is today the final arbiter in the affairs of men and it is as yet the final test of the worthwhileness of peoples  tested thus the korean fails  he lacks the nerve to remain when a strange army crosses his land  the few goods and chattels he may have managed to accumulate he puts on his back along with his doors and windows and away he heads for his mountain fastnesses  later he may return sans goods chattels doors and windows impelled by insatiable curiosity for a look see but it is curiosity merelya timid deerlike curiosity  he is prepared to bound away on his long legs at the first hint of danger or trouble  northern korea was a desolate land when the japanese passed through villages and towns were deserted  the fields lay untouched  there was no ploughing nor sowing no green things growing  little or nothing was to be purchased  one carried ones own food with him and food for horses and servants was the anxious problem that waited at the days end  in many a lonely village not an ounce nor a grain of anything could be bought and yet there might be standing around scores of whitegarmented stalwart koreans smoking yardlong pipes and chattering chatteringceaselessly chattering  love money or force could not procure from them a horseshoe or a horseshoe nail  upso was their invariable reply  upso cursed word which means have not got  they had tramped probably forty miles that day down from their hidingplaces just for a look see and forty miles back they would cheerfully tramp chattering all the way over what they had seen  shake a stick at them as they stand chattering about your campfire and the gloom of the landscape will be filled with tall flitting ghosts bounding like deer with great springy strides which one cannot but envy they have splendid vigour and fine bodies but they are accustomed to being beaten and robbed without protest or resistance by every chance foreigner who enters their country  from this nerveless forsaken korean land i rode down upon the sandy islands of the yalu  for weeks these islands had been the dread betweenthelines of two fighting armies  the air above had been rent by screaming projectiles  the echoes of the final battle had scarcely died away  the trains of japanese wounded and japanese dead were trailing by  on the conical hill a quarter of a mile away the russian dead were being buried in their trenches and in the shell holes made by the japanese  and here in the thick of it all a man was ploughing  green things were growingyoung onionsand the man who was weeding them paused from his labour long enough to sell me a handful  near by was the smokeblackened ruin of the farmhouse fired by the russians when they retreated from the riverbed  two men were removing the debris cleaning the confusion preparatory to rebuilding  they were clad in blue pigtails hung down their backs  i was in china  i rode to the shore into the village of kuelianching  there were no lounging men smoking long pipes and chattering  the previous day the russians had been there a bloody battle had been fought and today the japanese were therebut what was that to talk about  everybody was busy  men were offering eggs and chickens and fruit for sale upon the street and bread as i live bread in small round loaves or buns  i rode on into the country  everywhere a toiling population was in evidence  the houses and walls were strong and substantial  stone and brick replaced the mud walls of the korean dwellings  twilight fell and deepened and still the ploughs went up and down the fields the sowers following after  trains of wheelbarrows heavily loaded squeaked by and pekin carts drawn by from four to six cows horses mules ponies or jackassescows even with their newborn calves tottering along on puny legs outside the traces  everybody worked  everything worked  i saw a man mending the road  i was in china  i came to the city of antung and lodged with a merchant  he was a grain merchant  corn he had hundreds of bushels stored in great bins of stout matting peas and beans in sacks and in the back yard his millstones went round and round grinding out meal  also in his back yard were buildings containing vats sunk into the ground and here the tanners were at work making leather  i bought a measure of corn from mine host for my horses and he overcharged me thirty cents  i was in china  antung was jammed with japanese troops  it was the thick of war but it did not matter  the work of antung went on just the same  the shops were wide open the streets were lined with pedlars  one could buy anything get anything made  i dined at a chinese restaurant cleansed myself at a public bath in a private tub with a small boy to assist in the scrubbing  i bought condensed milk bitter canned vegetables bread and cake  i repeat it cakegood cake  i bought knives forks and spoons graniteware dishes and mugs  there were horseshoes and horseshoers  a worker in iron realized for me new designs of mine for my tent poles  my shoes were sent out to be repaired  a barber shampooed my hair  a servant returned with cornbeef in tins a bottle of port another of cognac and beer blessed beer to wash out from my throat the dust of an army  it was the land of canaan  i was in china  the korean is the perfect type of inefficiencyof utter worthlessness the chinese is the perfect type of industry  for sheer work no worker in the world can compare with him  work is the breath of his nostrils  it is his solution of existence  it is to him what wandering and fighting in far lands and spiritual adventure have been to other peoples  liberty to him epitomizes itself in access to the means of toil  to till the soil and labour interminably with rude implements and utensils is all he asks of life and of the powers that be  work is what he desires above all things and he will work at anything for anybody  during the taking of the taku forts he carried scaling ladders at the heads of the storming columns and planted them against the walls  he did this not from a sense of patriotism but for the invading foreign devils because they paid him a daily wage of fifty cents  he is not frightened by war  he accepts it as he does rain and sunshine the changing of the seasons and other natural phenomena  he prepares for it endures it and survives it and when the tide of battle sweeps by the thunder of the guns still reverberating in the distant canyons he is seen calmly bending to his usual tasks  nay war itself bears fruits whereof he may pick  before the dead are cold or the burial squads have arrived he is out on the field stripping the mangled bodies collecting the shrapnel and ferreting in the shell holes for slivers and fragments of iron  the chinese is no coward  he does not carry away his doors amid windows to the mountains but remains to guard them when alien soldiers occupy his town  he does not hide away his chickens and his eggs nor any other commodity he possesses  he proceeds at once to offer them for sale  nor is he to be bullied into lowering his price  what if the purchaser be a soldier and an alien made cocky by victory and confident by overwhelming force  he has two large pears saved over from last year which he will sell for five sen or for the same price three small pears  what if one soldier persist in taking away with him three large pears  what if there be twenty other soldiers jostling about him  he turns over his sack of fruit to another chinese and races down the street after his pears and the soldier responsible for their flight and he does not return till he has wrenched away one large pear from that soldiers grasp  nor is the chinese the type of permanence which he has been so often designated  he is not so illdisposed toward new ideas and new methods as his history would seem to indicate  true his forms customs and methods have been permanent these many centuries but this has been due to the fact that his government was in the hands of the learned classes and that these governing scholars found their salvation lay in suppressing all progressive ideas  the ideas behind the boxer troubles and the outbreaks over the introduction of railroad and other foreign devil machinations have emanated from the minds of the literati and been spread by their pamphlets and propagandists  originality and enterprise have been suppressed in the chinese for scores of generations  only has remained to him industry and in this has he found the supreme expression of his being  on the other hand his susceptibility to new ideas has been well demonstrated wherever he has escaped beyond the restrictions imposed upon him by his government  so far as the business man is concerned he has grasped far more clearly the western code of business the western ethics of business than has the japanese  he has learned as a matter of course to keep his word or his bond  as yet the japanese business man has failed to understand this when he has signed a time contract and when changing conditions cause him to lose by it the japanese merchant cannot understand why he should live up to his contract  it is beyond his comprehension and repulsive to his common sense that he should live up to his contract and thereby lose money  he firmly believes that the changing conditions themselves absolve him  and in so far adaptable as he has shown himself to be in other respects he fails to grasp a radically new idea where the chinese succeeds  here we have the chinese four hundred millions of him occupying a vast land of immense natural resourcesresources of a twentiethcentury age of a machine age resources of coal and iron which are the backbone of commercial civilization  he is an indefatigable worker  he is not dead to new ideas new methods new systems  under a capable management he can be made to do anything  truly would he of himself constitute the muchheralded yellow peril were it not for his present management  this management his government is set crystallized  it is what binds him down to building as his fathers built  the governing class entrenched by the precedent and power of centuries and by the stamp it has put upon his mind will never free him  it would be the suicide of the governing class and the governing class knows it  comes now the japanese  on the streets of antung of fengwangchang or of any other manchurian city the following is a familiar scene one is hurrying home through the dark of the unlighted streets when he comes upon a paper lantern resting on the ground  on one side squats a chinese civilian on his hams on the other side squats a japanese soldier  one dips his forefinger in the dust and writes strange monstrous characters the other nods understanding sweeps the dust slate level with his hand and with his forefinger inscribes similar characters  they are talking they cannot speak to each other but they can write  long ago one borrowed the others written language and long before that untold generations ago they diverged from a common root the ancient mongol stock  there have been changes differentiations brought about by diverse conditions and infusions of other blood but down at the bottom of their being twisted into the fibres of them is a heritage in commona sameness in kind which time has not obliterated  the infusion of other blood malay perhaps has made the japanese a race of mastery and power a fighting race through all its history a race which has always despised commerce and exalted fighting  today equipped with the finest machines and systems of destruction the caucasian mind has devised handling machines and systems with remarkable and deadly accuracy this rejuvenescent japanese race has embarked on a course of conquest the goal of which no man knows  the head men of japan are dreaming ambitiously and the people are dreaming blindly a napoleonic dream  and to this dream the japanese clings and will cling with bulldog tenacity  the soldier shouting nippon banzai on the walls of wiju the widow at home in her paper house committing suicide so that her only son her sole support may go to the front are both expressing the unanimity of the dream  the late disturbance in the far east marked the clashing of the dreams for the slav too is dreaming greatly  granting that the japanese can hurl back the slav and that the two great branches of the anglosaxon race do not despoil him of his spoils the japanese dream takes on substantiality  japans population is no larger because her people have continually pressed against the means of subsistence  but given poor empty korea for a breeding colony and manchuria for a granary and at once the japanese begins to increase by leaps and bounds  even so he would not of himself constitute a brown peril  he has not the time in which to grow and realize the dream  he is only fortyfive millions and so fast does the economic exploitation of the planet hurry on the planets partition amongst the western peoples that before he could attain the stature requisite to menace he would see the western giants in possession of the very stuff of his dream  the menace to the western world lies not in the little brown man but in the four hundred millions of yellow men should the little brown man undertake their management  the chinese is not dead to new ideas he is an efficient worker makes a good soldier and is wealthy in the essential materials of a machine age  under a capable management he will go far  the japanese is prepared and fit to undertake this management not only has he proved himself an apt imitator of western material progress a sturdy worker and a capable organizer but he is far more fit to manage the chinese than are we  the baffling enigma of the chinese character is no baffling enigma to him  he understands as we could never school ourselves nor hope to understand  their mental processes are largely the same  he thinks with the same thoughtsymbols as does the chinese and he thinks in the same peculiar grooves  he goes on where we are balked by the obstacles of incomprehension  he takes the turning which we cannot perceive twists around the obstacle and presto is out of sight in the ramifications of the chinese mind where we cannot follow  the chinese has been called the type of permanence and well he has merited it dozing as he has through the ages  and as truly was the japanese the type of permanence up to a generation ago when he suddenly awoke and startled the world with a rejuvenescence the like of which the world had never seen before  the ideas of the west were the leaven which quickened the japanese and the ideas of the west transmitted by the japanese mind into ideas japanese may well make the leaven powerful enough to quicken the chinese  we have had africa for the afrikander and at no distant day we shall hear asia for the asiatic  four hundred million indefatigable workers deft intelligent and unafraid to die aroused and rejuvenescent managed and guided by fortyfive million additional human beings who are splendid fighting animals scientific and modern constitute that menace to the western world which has been well named the yellow peril  the possibility of race adventure has not passed away  we are in the midst of our own  the slav is just girding himself up to begin  why may not the yellow and the brown start out on an adventure as tremendous as our own and more strikingly unique  the ultimate success of such an adventure the western mind refuses to consider  it is not the nature of life to believe itself weak  there is such a thing as race egotism as well as creature egotism and a very good thing it is  in the first place the western world will not permit the rise of the yellow peril  it is firmly convinced that it will not permit the yellow and the brown to wax strong and menace its peace and comfort it advances this idea with persistency and delivers itself of long arguments showing how and why this menace will not be permitted to arise today far more voices are engaged in denying the yellow peril than in prophesying it  the western world is warned if not armed against the possibility of it  in the second place there is a weakness inherent in the brown man which will bring his adventure to naught  from the west he has borrowed all our material achievement and passed our ethical achievement by  our engines of production and destruction he has made his  what was once solely ours he now duplicates rivalling our merchants in the commerce of the east thrashing the russian on sea and land  a marvellous imitator truly but imitating us only in things material  things spiritual cannot be imitated they must be felt and lived woven into the very fabric of life and here the japanese fails  it required no revolution of his nature to learn to calculate the range and fire a field gun or to march the goosestep  it was a mere matter of training  our material achievement is the product of our intellect  it is knowledge and knowledge like coin is interchangeable  it is not wrapped up in the heredity of the newborn child but is something to be acquired afterward  not so with our soul stuff which is the product of an evolution which goes back to the raw beginnings of the race  our soul stuff is not a coin to be pocketed by the first chance comer  the japanese cannot pocket it any more than he can thrill to short saxon words or we can thrill to chinese hieroglyphics  the leopard cannot change its spots nor can the japanese nor can we  we are thumbed by the ages into what we are and by no conscious inward effort can we in a day rethumb ourselves  nor can the japanese in a day or a generation rethumb himself in our image  back of our own great race adventure back of our robberies by sea and land our lusts and violences and all the evil things we have done there is a certain integrity a sternness of conscience a melancholy responsibility of life a sympathy and comradeship and warm human feel which is ours indubitably ours and which we cannot teach to the oriental as we would teach logarithms or the trajectory of projectiles that we have groped for the way of right conduct and agonized over the soul betokens our spiritual endowment  though we have strayed often and far from righteousness the voices of the seers have always been raised and we have harked back to the bidding of conscience  the colossal fact of our history is that we have made the religion of jesus christ our religion  no matter how dark in error and deed ours has been a history of spiritual struggle and endeavour  we are preeminently a religious race which is another way of saying that we are a rightseeking race  what do you think of the japanese was asked an american woman after she had lived some time in japan  it seems to me that they have no soul was her answer  this must not be taken to mean that the japanese is without soul  but it serves to illustrate the enormous difference between their souls and this womans soul  there was no feel no speech no recognition  this western soul did not dream that the eastern soul existed it was so different so totally different  religion as a battle for the right in our sense of right as a yearning and a strife for spiritual good and purity is unknown to the japanese  measured by what religion means to us the japanese is a race without religion  yet it has a religion and who shall say that it is not as great a religion as ours nor as efficacious  as one japanese has written  our reflection brought into prominence not so much the moral as the national consciousness of the individual    to us the country is more than land and soil from which to mine gold or reap grainit is the sacred abode of the gods the spirit of our forefathers to us the emperor is more than the arch constable of a reichsstaat or even the patron of a kulturstaat he is the bodily representative of heaven on earth blending in his person its power and its mercy  the religion of japan is practically a worship of the state itself patriotism is the expression of this worship  the japanese mind does not split hairs as to whether the emperor is heaven incarnate or the state incarnate  so far as the japanese are concerned the emperor lives is himself deity  the emperor is the object to live for and to die for the japanese is not an individualist  he has developed national consciousness instead of moral consciousness  he is not interested in his own moral welfare except in so far as it is the welfare of the state the honour of the individual per se does not exist  only exists the honour of the state which is his honour  he does not look upon himself as a free agent working out his own personal salvation  spiritual agonizing is unknown to him  he has a sense of calm trust in fate a quiet submission to the inevitable a stoic composure in sight of danger or calamity a disdain of life and friendliness with death  he relates himself to the state as amongst bees the worker is related to the hive himself nothing the state everything his reasons for existence the exaltation and glorification of the state  the most admired quality today of the japanese is his patriotism  the western world is in rhapsodies over it unwittingly measuring the japanese patriotism by its own conceptions of patriotism  for god my country and the czar cries the russian patriot but in the japanese mind there is no differentiation between the three  the emperor is the emperor and god and country as well  the patriotism of the japanese is blind and unswerving loyalty to what is practically an absolutism  the emperor can do no wrong nor can the five ambitious great men who have his ear and control the destiny of japan  no great race adventure can go far nor endure long which has no deeper foundation than material success no higher prompting than conquest for conquests sake and mere race glorification  to go far and to endure it must have behind it an ethical impulse a sincerely conceived righteousness  but it must be taken into consideration that the above postulate is itself a product of western raceegotism urged by our belief in our own righteousness and fostered by a faith in ourselves which may be as erroneous as are most fond race fancies  so be it  the world is whirling faster today than ever before  it has gained impetus affairs rush to conclusion  the far east is the point of contact of the adventuring western people as well as of the asiatic  we shall not have to wait for our childrens time nor our childrens children  we shall ourselves see and largely determine the adventure of the yellow and the brown  fengwangcheng manchuria june 1904     what life means to me   i was born in the workingclass  early i discovered enthusiasm ambition and ideals and to satisfy these became the problem of my childlife  my environment was crude and rough and raw  i had no outlook but an uplook rather  my place in society was at the bottom here life offered nothing but sordidness and wretchedness both of the flesh and the spirit for here flesh and spirit were alike starved and tormented  above me towered the colossal edifice of society and to my mind the only way out was up  into this edifice i early resolved to climb  up above men wore black clothes and boiled shirts and women dressed in beautiful gowns  also there were good things to eat and there was plenty to eat this much for the flesh  then there were the things of the spirit  up above me i knew were unselfishnesses of the spirit clean and noble thinking keen intellectual living  i knew all this because i read seaside library novels in which with the exception of the villains and adventuresses all men and women thought beautiful thoughts spoke a beautiful tongue and performed glorious deeds  in short as i accepted the rising of the sun i accepted that up above me was all that was fine and noble and gracious all that gave decency and dignity to life all that made life worth living and that remunerated one for his travail and misery  but it is not particularly easy for one to climb up out of the workingclassespecially if he is handicapped by the possession of ideals and illusions  i lived on a ranch in california and was hard put to find the ladder whereby to climb  i early inquired the rate of interest on invested money and worried my childs brain into an understanding of the virtues and excellences of that remarkable invention of man compound interest  further i ascertained the current rates of wages for workers of all ages and the cost of living  from all this data i concluded that if i began immediately and worked and saved until i was fifty years of age i could then stop working and enter into participation in a fair portion of the delights and goodnesses that would then be open to me higher up in society  of course i resolutely determined not to marry while i quite forgot to consider at all that great rock of disaster in the workingclass worldsickness  but the life that was in me demanded more than a meagre existence of scraping and scrimping  also at ten years of age i became a newsboy on the streets of a city and found myself with a changed uplook  all about me were still the same sordidness and wretchedness and up above me was still the same paradise waiting to be gained but the ladder whereby to climb was a different one  it was now the ladder of business  why save my earnings and invest in government bonds when by buying two newspapers for five cents with a turn of the wrist i could sell them for ten cents and double my capital  the business ladder was the ladder for me and i had a vision of myself becoming a baldheaded and successful merchant prince  alas for visions  when i was sixteen i had already earned the title of prince  but this title was given me by a gang of cutthroats and thieves by whom i was called the prince of the oyster pirates  and at that time i had climbed the first rung of the business ladder  i was a capitalist  i owned a boat and a complete oysterpirating outfit  i had begun to exploit my fellowcreatures  i had a crew of one man  as captain and owner i took twothirds of the spoils and gave the crew onethird though the crew worked just as hard as i did and risked just as much his life and liberty  this one rung was the height i climbed up the business ladder  one night i went on a raid amongst the chinese fishermen  ropes and nets were worth dollars and cents  it was robbery i grant but it was precisely the spirit of capitalism  the capitalist takes away the possessions of his fellowcreatures by means of a rebate or of a betrayal of trust or by the purchase of senators and supremecourt judges  i was merely crude  that was the only difference  i used a gun  but my crew that night was one of those inefficients against whom the capitalist is wont to fulminate because forsooth such inefficients increase expenses and reduce dividends  my crew did both  what of his carelessness he set fire to the big mainsail and totally destroyed it there werent any dividends that night and the chinese fishermen were richer by the nets and ropes we did not get  i was bankrupt unable just then to pay sixtyfive dollars for a new mainsail  i left my boat at anchor and went off on a baypirate boat on a raid up the sacramento river  while away on this trip another gang of bay pirates raided my boat  they stole everything even the anchors and later on when i recovered the drifting hulk i sold it for twenty dollars  i had slipped back the one rung i had climbed and never again did i attempt the business ladder  from then on i was mercilessly exploited by other capitalists  i had the muscle and they made money out of it while i made but a very indifferent living out of it  i was a sailor before the mast a longshoreman a roustabout i worked in canneries and factories and laundries i mowed lawns and cleaned carpets and washed windows  and i never got the full product of my toil  i looked at the daughter of the cannery owner in her carriage and knew that it was my muscle in part that helped drag along that carriage on its rubber tyres  i looked at the son of the factory owner going to college and knew that it was my muscle that helped in part to pay for the wine and good fellowship he enjoyed  but i did not resent this  it was all in the game  they were the strong  very well i was strong  i would carve my way to a place amongst them and make money out of the muscles of other men  i was not afraid of work  i loved hard work  i would pitch in and work harder than ever and eventually become a pillar of society  and just then as luck would have it i found an employer that was of the same mind  i was willing to work and he was more than willing that i should work  i thought i was learning a trade  in reality i had displaced two men  i thought he was making an electrician out of me as a matter of fact he was making fifty dollars per month out of me  the two men i had displaced had received forty dollars each per month i was doing the work of both for thirty dollars per month  this employer worked me nearly to death  a man may love oysters but too many oysters will disincline him toward that particular diet  and so with me  too much work sickened me  i did not wish ever to see work again  i fled from work  i became a tramp begging my way from door to door wandering over the united states and sweating bloody sweats in slums and prisons  i had been born in the workingclass and i was now at the age of eighteen beneath the point at which i had started  i was down in the cellar of society down in the subterranean depths of misery about which it is neither nice nor proper to speak  i was in the pit the abyss the human cesspool the shambles and the charnelhouse of our civilization this is the part of the edifice of society that society chooses to ignore  lack of space compels me here to ignore it and i shall say only that the things i there saw gave me a terrible scare  i was scared into thinking  i saw the naked simplicities of the complicated civilization in which i lived  life was a matter of food and shelter  in order to get food and shelter men sold things  the merchant sold shoes the politician sold his manhood and the representative of the people with exceptions of course sold his trust while nearly all sold their honour  women too whether on the street or in the holy bond of wedlock were prone to sell their flesh  all things were commodities all people bought and sold  the one commodity that labour had to sell was muscle  the honour of labour had no price in the marketplace labour had muscle and muscle alone to sell  but there was a difference a vital difference  shoes and trust and honour had a way of renewing themselves  they were imperishable stocks muscle on the other hand did not renew  as the shoe merchant sold shoes he continued to replenish his stock  but there was no way of replenishing the labourers stock of muscle  the more he sold of his muscle the less of it remained to him  it was his one commodity and each day his stock of it diminished  in the end if he did not die before he sold out and put up his shutters  he was a muscle bankrupt and nothing remained to him but to go down into the cellar of society and perish miserably  i learned further that brain was likewise a commodity  it too was different from muscle  a brain seller was only at his prime when he was fifty or sixty years old and his wares were fetching higher prices than ever  but a labourer was worked out or broken down at fortyfive or fifty  i had been in the cellar of society and i did not like the place as a habitation  the pipes and drains were unsanitary and the air was bad to breathe  if i could not live on the parlour floor of society i could at any rate have a try at the attic  it was true the diet there was slim but the air at least was pure  so i resolved to sell no more muscle and to become a vendor of brains  then began a frantic pursuit of knowledge  i returned to california and opened the books  while thus equipping myself to become a brain merchant it was inevitable that i should delve into sociology  there i found in a certain class of books scientifically formulated the simple sociological concepts i had already worked out for myself  other and greater minds before i was born had worked out all that i had thought and a vast deal more  i discovered that i was a socialist  the socialists were revolutionists inasmuch as they struggled to overthrow the society of the present and out of the material to build the society of the future  i too was a socialist and a revolutionist i joined the groups of workingclass and intellectual revolutionists and for the first time came into intellectual living  here i found keenflashing intellects and brilliant wits for here i met strong and alertbrained withal hornyhanded members of the workingclass unfrocked preachers too wide in their christianity for any congregation of mammonworshippers professors broken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class and flung out because they were quick with knowledge which they strove to apply to the affairs of mankind  here i found also warm faith in the human glowing idealism sweetnesses of unselfishness renunciation and martyrdomall the splendid stinging things of the spirit  here life was clean noble and alive  here life rehabilitated itself became wonderful and glorious and i was glad to be alive  i was in touch with great souls who exalted flesh and spirit over dollars and cents and to whom the thin wail of the starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of commercial expansion and world empire  all about me were nobleness of purpose and heroism of effort and my days and nights were sunshine and starshine all fire and dew with before my eyes ever burning and blazing the holy grail christs own grail the warm human longsuffering and maltreated but to be rescued and saved at the last  and i poor foolish i deemed all this to be a mere foretaste of the delights of living i should find higher above me in society  i had lost many illusions since the day i read seaside library novels on the california ranch  i was destined to lose many of the illusions i still retained  as a brain merchant i was a success  society opened its portals to me i entered right in on the parlour floor and my disillusionment proceeded rapidly  i sat down to dinner with the masters of society and with the wives and daughters of the masters of society  the women were gowned beautifully i admit but to my naive surprise i discovered that they were of the same clay as all the rest of the women i had known down below in the cellar  the colonels lady and judy ogrady were sisters under their skinsand gowns  it was not this however so much as their materialism that shocked me it is true these beautifully gowned beautiful women prattled sweet little ideals and dear little moralities but in spite of their prattle the dominant key of the life they lived was materialistic  and they were so sentimentally selfish  they assisted in all kinds of sweet little charities and informed one of the fact while all the time the food they ate and the beautiful clothes they wore were bought out of dividends stained with the blood of child labour and sweated labour and of prostitution itself  when i mentioned such facts expecting in my innocence that these sisters of judy ogrady would at once strip off their blooddyed silks and jewels they became excited and angry and read me preachments about the lack of thrift the drink and the innate depravity that caused all the misery in societys cellar  when i mentioned that i couldnt quite see that it was the lack of thrift the intemperance and the depravity of a halfstarved child of six that made it work twelve hours every night in a southern cotton mill these sisters of judy ogrady attacked my private life and called me an agitatoras though that forsooth settled the argument  nor did i fare better with the masters themselves  i had expected to find men who were clean noble and alive whose ideals were clean noble and alive  i went about amongst the men who sat in the high placesthe preachers the politicians the business men the professors and the editors  i ate meat with them drank wine with them automobiled with them and studied them  it is true i found many that were clean and noble but with rare exceptions they were not alive  i do verily believe i could count the exceptions on the fingers of my two hands where they were not alive with rottenness quick with unclean life there were merely the unburied deadclean and noble like wellpreserved mummies but not alive  in this connection i may especially mention the professors i met the men who live up to that decadent university ideal the passionless pursuit of passionless intelligence  i met men who invoked the name of the prince of peace in their diatribes against war and who put rifles in the hands of pinkertons with which to shoot down strikers in their own factories  i met men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of prizefighting and who at the same time were parties to the adulteration of food that killed each year more babies than even redhanded herod had killed  i talked in hotels and clubs and homes and pullmans and steamerchairs with captains of industry and marvelled at how little travelled they were in the realm of intellect  on the other hand i discovered that their intellect in the business sense was abnormally developed  also i discovered that their morality where business was concerned was nil  this delicate aristocraticfeatured gentleman was a dummy director and a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans  this gentleman who collected fine editions and was an especial patron of literature paid blackmail to a heavyjowled blackbrowed boss of a municipal machine  this editor who published patent medicine advertisements and did not dare print the truth in his paper about said patent medicines for fear of losing the advertising called me a scoundrelly demagogue because i told him that his political economy was antiquated and that his biology was contemporaneous with pliny  this senator was the tool and the slave the little puppet of a gross uneducated machine boss so was this governor and this supreme court judge and all three rode on railroad passes  this man talking soberly and earnestly about the beauties of idealism and the goodness of god had just betrayed his comrades in a business deal  this man a pillar of the church and heavy contributor to foreign missions worked his shop girls ten hours a day on a starvation wage and thereby directly encouraged prostitution  this man who endowed chairs in universities perjured himself in courts of law over a matter of dollars and cents  and this railroad magnate broke his word as a gentleman and a christian when he granted a secret rebate to one of two captains of industry locked together in a struggle to the death  it was the same everywhere crime and betrayal betrayal and crimemen who were alive but who were neither clean nor noble men who were clean and noble but who were not alive  then there was a great hopeless mass neither noble nor alive but merely clean  it did not sin positively nor deliberately but it did sin passively and ignorantly by acquiescing in the current immorality and profiting by it  had it been noble and alive it would not have been ignorant and it would have refused to share in the profits of betrayal and crime  i discovered that i did not like to live on the parlour floor of society intellectually i was as bored  morally and spiritually i was sickened i remembered my intellectuals and idealists my unfrocked preachers broken professors and cleanminded classconscious workingmen  i remembered my days and nights of sunshine and starshine where life was all a wild sweet wonder a spiritual paradise of unselfish adventure and ethical romance  and i saw before me ever blazing and burning the holy grail  so i went back to the workingclass in which i had been born and where i belonged  i care no longer to climb  the imposing edifice of society above my head holds no delights for me  it is the foundation of the edifice that interests me  there i am content to labour crowbar in hand shoulder to shoulder with intellectuals idealists and classconscious workingmen getting a solid pry now and again and setting the whole edifice rocking  some day when we get a few more hands and crowbars to work well topple it over along with all its rotten life and unburied dead its monstrous selfishness and sodden materialism  then well cleanse the cellar and build a new habitation for mankind in which there will be no parlour floor in which all the rooms will be bright and airy and where the air that is breathed will be clean noble and alive  such is my outlook  i look forward to a time when man shall progress upon something worthier and higher than his stomach when there will be a finer incentive to impel men to action than the incentive of today which is the incentive of the stomach  i retain my belief in the nobility and excellence of the human  i believe that spiritual sweetness and unselfishness will conquer the gross gluttony of today  and last of all my faith is in the workingclass  as some frenchman has said the stairway of time is ever echoing with the wooden shoe going up the polished boot descending  newton iowa november 1905
