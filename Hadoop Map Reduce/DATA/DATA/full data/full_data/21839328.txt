21839328	odd craft  by ww jacobs    the changing numbers  the tall clock in the corner of the small livingroom had just struck eight as mr samuel gunnill came stealthily down the winding staircase and opening the door at the foot stepped with an appearance of great care and humility into the room  he noticed with some anxiety that his daughter selina was apparently engrossed in her task of attending to the plants in the window and that no preparations whatever had been made for breakfast  illustration mr samuel gunnill came stealthily down the winding staircase  miss gunnills horticultural duties seemed interminable  she snipped off dead leaves with painstaking precision and administered water with the jealous care of a druggist compounding a prescription then with her back still toward him she gave vent to a sigh far too intense in its nature to have reference to such trivialities as plants  she repeated it twice and at the second time mr gunnill almost without his knowledge uttered a deprecatory cough  his daughter turned with alarming swiftness and holding herself very upright favoured him with a glance in which indignation and surprise were very fairly mingled  that white onethat one at the end said mr gunnill with an appearance of concentrated interest thats my favrite  miss gunnill put her hands together and a look of infinite longsuffering came upon her face but she made no reply  always has been continued mr gunnill feverishly from afrom a cutting  bailed out said miss gunnill in a deep and thrilling voice bailed out at one oclock in the morning brought home singing loud enough for halfadozen and then talking about flowers  mr gunnill coughed again  i was dreaming pursued miss gunnill plaintively sleeping peacefully when i was awoke by a horrible noise  that couldnt ha been me protested her father  i was only a bit cheerful  it was benjamin elys birthday yesterday and after we left the lion they started singing and i just hummed to keep em company  i wasnt singing mind you only hummingwhen up comes that interfering cooper and takes me off  miss gunnill shivered and with her pretty cheek in her hand sat by the window the very picture of despondency  why didnt he take the others she inquired  ah said mr gunnill with great emphasis thats what a lot more of us would like to know  praps if youd been more polite to mrs cooper instead o putting it about that she looked young enough to be his mother it wouldnt have happened  his daughter shook her head impatiently and on mr gunnill making an allusion to breakfast expressed surprise that he had got the heart to eat anything  mr gunnill pressing the point however she arose and began to set the table the undue care with which she smoothed out the creases of the tablecloth and the mathematical exactness with which she placed the various articles all being so many extra smarts in his wound when she finally placed on the table enough food for a dozen people he began to show signs of a little spirit  aint you going to have any he demanded as miss gunnill resumed her seat by the window  me said the girl with a shudder  breakfast  the disgrace is breakfast enough for me  i couldnt eat a morsel it would choke me  mr gunnill eyed her over the rim of his teacup  i come down an hour ago he said casually as he helped himself to some bacon  miss gunnill started despite herself  oh she said listlessly  and i see you making a very good breakfast all by yourself in the kitchen continued her father in a voice not free from the taint of triumph  the discomfited selina rose and stood regarding him mr gunnill after a vain attempt to meet her gaze busied himself with his meal  the idea of watching every mouthful i eat  said miss gunnill tragically the idea of complaining because i have some breakfast  id never have believed it of you never  its shameful  fancy grudging your own daughter the food she eats  mr gunnill eyed her in dismay  in his confusion he had overestimated the capacity of his mouth and he now strove in vain to reply to this shameful perversion of his meaning  his daughter stood watching him with grief in one eye and calculation in the other and just as he had put himself into a position to exercise his rights of free speech gave a pathetic sniff and walked out of the room  she stayed indoors all day but the necessity of establishing his innocence took mr gunnill out a great deal  his neighbours in the hope of further excitement warmly pressed him to go to prison rather than pay a fine and instanced the example of an officer in the salvation army who in very different circumstances had elected to take that course mr gunnill assured them that only his known antipathy to the army and the fear of being regarded as one of its followers prevented him from doing so  he paid instead a fine of ten shillings and after listening to a sermon in which his silver hairs served as the text was permitted to depart  his feeling against policeconstable cooper increased with the passing of the days  the constable watched him with the air of a proprietor and mrs coopers remark that her husband had had his eye upon him for a long time and that he had better be careful for the future was faithfully retailed to him within half an hour of its utterance  convivial friends counted his cups for him teetotal friends more than hinted that cooper was in the employ of his good angel  illustration the constable watched him with the air of a proprietor  miss gunnills two principal admirers had an arduous task to perform they had to attribute mr gunnills disaster to the vindictiveness of cooper and at the same time to agree with his daughter that it served him right  between father and daughter they had a difficult time mr gunnills sensitiveness having been much heightened by his troubles  cooper ought not to have taken you said herbert sims for the fiftieth time  he must ha seen you like it dozens o times before said ted drill who in his determination not to be outdone by mr sims was not displaying his usual judgment  why didnt he take you then  thats what you ought to have asked the magistrate  i dont understand you said mr gunnill with an air of cold dignity  why said mr drill what i mean islook at that night for instance when  he broke off suddenly even his enthusiasm not being proof against the extraordinary contortions of visage in which mr gunnill was indulging  when  prompted selina and mr sims together  mr gunnill after first daring him with his eye followed suit  that night at the crown said mr drill awkwardly  you know when you thought that joe baggs was the landlord  you tell em you tell it best  ive roared over it  i dont know what youre driving at said the harassed mr gunnill bitterly  hm  said mr drill with a weak laugh  ive been mixing you up with somebody else  mr gunnill obviously relieved said that he ought to be more careful and pointed out with some feeling that a lot of mischief was caused that way  cooper wants a lesson thats what he wants said mr sims valiantly hell get his head broke one of these days  mr gunnill acquiesced  i remember when i was on the peewit he said musingly one time when we were lying at cardiff there was a policeman there run one of our chaps in and two nights afterward another of our chaps pushed the policeman down in the mud and ran off with his staff and his helmet  miss gunnills eyes glistened  what happened she inquired  he had to leave the force replied her father he couldnt stand the disgrace of it  the chap that pushed him over was quite a little chap too  about the size of herbert here  mr sims started  very much like him in face too pursued mr gunnill daring chap he was  miss gunnill sighed  i wish he lived in littlestow she said slowly id give anything to take that horrid mrs cooper down a bit  cooper would be the laughingstock of the town  messrs sims and drill looked unhappy  it was hard to have to affect an attitude of indifference in the face of miss gunnills lawless yearnings to stand before her as respectable and lawabiding cravens  her eyes large and sorrowful dwelt on them both  if ii only get a chance at cooper murmured mr sims vaguely  to his surprise mr gunnill started up from his chair and gripping his hand shook it fervently  he looked round and selina was regarding him with a glance so tender that he lost his head completely  before he had recovered he had pledged himself to lay the helmet and truncheon of the redoubtable mr cooper at the feet of miss gunnill exact date not specified  of course i shall have to wait my opportunity he said at last  you wait as long as you like my boy said the thoughtless mr gunnill  mr sims thanked him  wait till coopers an old man urged mr drill  miss gunnill secretly disappointed at the lack of boldness and devotion on the part of the latter gentleman eyed his stalwart frame indignantly and accused him of trying to make mr sims as timid as himself  she turned to the valiant sims and made herself so agreeable to that daring blade that mr drill a prey to violent jealousy bade the company a curt goodnight and withdrew  he stayed away for nearly a week and then one evening as he approached the house carrying a carpetbag he saw the door just opening to admit the fortunate herbert  he quickened his pace and arrived just in time to follow him in  mr sims who bore under his arm a brownpaper parcel seemed somewhat embarrassed at seeing him and after a brief greeting walked into the room and with a triumphant glance at mr gunnill and selina placed his burden on the table  illustration he saw the door just opening to admit the fortunate herbert  youyou aint got it  said mr gunnill leaning forward  how foolish of you to run such a risk  said selina  i brought it for miss gunnill said the young man simply  he unfastened the parcel and to the astonishment of all present revealed a policemans helmet and a short boxwood truncheon  youyoure a wonder said the gloating mr gunnill  look at it ted  mr drill was looking at it it may be doubted whether the head of mr cooper itself could have caused him more astonishment  then his eyes sought those of mr sims but that gentleman was gazing tenderly at the gratified but shocked selina  how ever did you do it  inquired mr gunnill  came behind him and threw him down said mr sims nonchalantly  he was that scared i believe i could have taken his boots as well if id wanted them  mr gunnill patted him on the back  i fancy i can see him running bareheaded through the town calling for help he said smiling  mr sims shook his head  like as not itll be kept quiet for the credit of the force he said slowly unless of course they discover who did it  a slight shade fell on the goodhumoured countenance of mr gunnill but it was chased away almost immediately by sims reminding him of the chaff of coopers brotherconstables  and you might take the others away said mr gunnill brightening you might keep on doing it  mr sims said doubtfully that he might but pointed out that cooper would probably be on his guard for the future  yes youve done your share said miss gunnill with a halfglance at mr drill who was still gazing in a bewildered fashion at the trophies you can come into the kitchen and help me draw some beer if you like  mr sims followed her joyfully and reaching down a jug for her watched her tenderly as she drew the beer  all women love valour but miss gunnill gazing sadly at the slight figure of mr sims could not help wishing that mr drill possessed a little of his spirit  illustration mr sims watched her tenderly as she drew the beer  she had just finished her task when a tremendous bumping noise was heard in the livingroom and the plates on the dresser were nearly shaken off their shelves  whats that she cried  they ran to the room and stood aghast in the doorway at the spectacle of mr gunnill with his clenched fists held tightly by his side bounding into the air with all the grace of a trained acrobat while mr drill encouraged him from an easychair  mr gunnill smiled broadly as he met their astonished gaze and with a final bound kicked something along the floor and subsided into his seat panting  mr sims suddenly enlightened uttered a cry of dismay and darting under the table picked up what had once been a policemans helmet  then he snatched a partially consumed truncheon from the fire and stood white and trembling before the astonished mr gunnill  whats the matter inquired the latter  youyouve spoilt em gasped mr sims  what of it  said mr gunnill staring  i wasgoing to take em away stammered mr sims  well theyll be easier to carry now said mr drill simply  mr sims glanced at him sharply and then to the extreme astonishment of mr gunnill snatched up the relics and wrapping them up in the paper dashed out of the house  mr gunnill turned a look of blank inquiry upon mr drill  it wasnt coopers number on the helmet said that gentleman  eh shouted mr gunnill  how do you know inquired selina  i just happened to notice replied mr drill  he reached down as though to take up the carpetbag which he had placed by the side of his chair and then apparently thinking better of it leaned back in his seat and eyed mr gunnill  do you mean to tell me said the latter that hes been and upset the wrong man  mr drill shook his head  thats the puzzle he said softly  he smiled over at miss gunnill but that young lady who found him somewhat mysterious looked away and frowned  her father sat and exhausted conjecture his final conclusion being that mr sims had attacked the first policeman that had come in his way and was now suffering the agonies of remorse  he raised his head sharply at the sound of hurried footsteps outside there was a smart rap at the street door then the handle was turned and the next moment to the dismay of all present the red and angry face of one of mr coopers brotherconstables was thrust into the room  mr gunnill gazed at it in helpless fascination  the body of the constable garbed in plain clothes followed the face and standing before him in a menacing fashion held out a broken helmet and staff  have you seen these afore he inquired in a terrible voice  no said mr gunnill with an attempt at surprise  what are they  ill tell you what they are said policeconstable jenkins ferociously theyre my helmet and truncheon  youve been spoiling his majestys property and youll be locked up  yours said the astonished mr gunnill  i lent em to young sims just for a joke said the constable  i felt all along i was doing a silly thing  its no joke said mr gunnill severely  ill tell young herbert what i think of him trying to deceive me like that  never mind about deceiving interrupted the constable  what are you going to do about it  what are you  inquired mr gunnill hardily  it seems to me its between you and him youll very likely be dismissed from the force and all through trying to deceive  i wash my hands of it  youd no business to lend it said drill interrupting the constables indignant retort especially for sims to pretend that he had stolen it from cooper  its a roundabout sort of thing but you cant tell of mr gunnill without getting into trouble yourself  i shall have to put up with that said the constable desperately its got to be explained  its my dayhelmet too and the night ones as shabby as can be  twenty years in the force and never a mark against my name till now  if youd only keep quiet a bit instead of talking so much said mr drill who had been doing some hard thinking i might be able to help you praps  how inquired the constable  help him if you can ted said mr gunnill eagerly we ought all to help others when we get a chance  mr drill sat bolt upright and looked very wise  he took the smashed helmet from the table and examined it carefully  it was broken in at least halfadozen places and he laboured in vain to push it into shape  he might as well have tried to make a silk hat out of a concertina  the only thing that had escaped injury was the metal plate with the number  why dont you mend it  he inquired at last  mend it shouted the incensed mr jenkins  why dont you  i think i could said mr drill slowly give me half an hour in the kitchen and ill try  have as long as you like said mr gunnill  and i shall want some glue and miss gunnill and some tintacks said drill  what do you want me for inquired selina  to hold the things for me replied mr drill  miss gunnill tossed her head but after a little demur consented and drill ignoring the impatience of the constable picked up his bag and led the way into the kitchen  messrs gunnill and jenkins left behind in the livingroom sought for some neutral topic of discourse but in vain conversation would revolve round hard labour and lost pensions from the kitchen came sounds of hammering then a loud ooh from miss gunnill followed by a burst of laughter and a clapping of hands  mr jenkins shifted in his seat and exchanged glances with mr gunnill  illustration from the kitchen came sounds of hammering  hes a clever fellow said that gentleman hopefully  you should hear him imitate a canary lifelike it is  mr jenkins was about to make a hasty and obvious rejoinder when the kitchen door opened and selina emerged followed by drill  the snarl which the constable had prepared died away in a murmur of astonishment as he took the helmet  it looked as good as ever  he turned it over and over in amaze and looked in vain for any signs of the disastrous cracks  it was stiff and upright  he looked at the number it was his own  his eyes round with astonishment he tried it on and then his face relaxed  it dont fit as well as it did he said  well upon my word some people are never satisfied said the indignant drill  there isnt another man in england could have done it better  im not grumbling said the constable hastily its a wonderful piece o work  wonderful  i cant even see where it was broke  how on earth did you do it  drill shook his head  its a secret process he said slowly  i might want to go into the hat trade some day and im not going to give things away  quite right said mr jenkins  stillwell its a marvel thats what it is a fair marvel  if you take my advice youll go in the hat trade tomorrow my lad  im not surprised said mr gunnill whose face as he spoke was a map of astonishment  not a bit  ive seen him do more surprising things than that  have a go at the staff now teddy  ill see about it said mr drill modestly  i cant do impossibilities  you leave it here mr jenkins and well talk about it later on  mr jenkins still marvelling over his helmet assented and after another reference to the possibilities in the hat trade to a man with a born gift for repairs wrapped his property in a piece of newspaper and departed whistling  ted said mr gunnill impressively as he sank into his chair with a sigh of relief  how you done it i dont know  its a surprise even to me  he is very clever said selina with a kind smile  mr drill turned pale and then somewhat emboldened by praise from such a quarter dropped into a chair by her side and began to talk in low tones  the grateful mr gunnill more relieved than he cared to confess thoughtfully closed his eyes  i didnt think all along that youd let herbert outdo you said selina  i want to outdo him said mr drill in a voice of much meaning  miss gunnill cast down her eyes and mr drill had just plucked up sufficient courage to take her hand when footsteps stopped at the house the handle of the door was turned and for the second time that evening the inflamed visage of mr jenkins confronted the company  dont tell me its a failure said mr gunnill starting from his chair  you must have been handling it roughly  it was as good as new when you took it away  mr jenkins waved him away and fixed his eyes upon drill  you think youre mighty clever i dare say he said grimly but i can put two and two together  ive just heard of it  heard of two and two said drill looking puzzled  i dont want any of your nonsense said mr jenkins  im not on duty now but i warn you not to say anything that may be used against you  i never do said mr drill piously  somebody threw a handful o flour in poor coopers face a couple of hours ago said mr jenkins watching him closely and while he was getting it out of his eyes they upset him and made off with his helmet and truncheon  i just met brown and he says coopers been going on like a madman  by jove its a good job i mended your helmet for you said mr drill or else they might have suspected you  mr jenkins stared at him  i know who did do it he said significantly  herbert sims guessed mr drill in a stage whisper  youll be one o the first to know said mr jenkins darkly hell be arrested tomorrow  fancy the impudence of it  its shocking  mr drill whistled  nell dont let that little affair o yours with sims be known he said quietly  have that kept quietif you can  mr jenkins started as though he had been stung  in the joy of a case he had overlooked one or two things  he turned and regarded the young man wistfully  dont call on me as a witness thats all continued mr drill  i never was a mischiefmaker and i shouldnt like to have to tell how you lent your helmet to sims so that he could pretend he had knocked cooper down and taken it from him  illustration dont call on me as a witness thats all continued mr drill  wouldnt look at all well said mr gunnill nodding his head sagely  mr jenkins breathed hard and looked from one to the other  it was plain that it was no good reminding them that he had not had a case for five years  when i say that i know who did it he said slowly i mean that i have my suspicions  dont call on me as a witness thats all continued mr drill  ah said mr drill thats a very different thing  nothing like the same said mr gunnill pouring the constable a glass of ale  mr jenkins drank it and smacked his lips feebly  sims neednt know anything about that helmet being repaired he said at last  certainly not said everybody  mr jenkins sighed and turned to drill  its no good spoiling the ship for a haporth o tar he said with a faint suspicion of a wink  no said drill looking puzzled  anything thats worth doing at all is worth doing well continued the constable and while im drinking another glass with mr gunnill here suppose you go into the kitchen with that useful bag o yours and finish repairing my truncheon
