58110933	eugene pickering by henry james   chapter i   it was at homburg several years ago before the gaming had been suppressed  the evening was very warm and all the world was gathered on the terrace of the kursaal and the esplanade below it to listen to the excellent orchestra or half the world rather for the crowd was equally dense in the gamingrooms around the tables  everywhere the crowd was great  the night was perfect the season was at its height the open windows of the kursaal sent long shafts of unnatural light into the dusky woods and now and then in the intervals of the music one might almost hear the clink of the napoleons and the metallic call of the croupiers rise above the watching silence of the saloons  i had been strolling with a friend and we at last prepared to sit down  chairs however were scarce  i had captured one but it seemed no easy matter to find a mate for it  i was on the point of giving up in despair and proposing an adjournment to the silken ottomans of the kursaal when i observed a young man lounging back on one of the objects of my quest with his feet supported on the rounds of another  this was more than his share of luxury and i promptly approached him  he evidently belonged to the race which has the credit of knowing best at home and abroad how to make itself comfortable but something in his appearance suggested that his present attitude was the result of inadvertence rather than of egotism he was staring at the conductor of the orchestra and listening intently to the music  his hands were locked round his long legs and his mouth was half open with rather a foolish air  there are so few chairs i said that i must beg you to surrender this second one  he started stared blushed pushed the chair away with awkward alacrity and murmured something about not having noticed that he had it  what an oddlooking youth said my companion who had watched me as i seated myself beside her  yes he is oddlooking but what is odder still is that i have seen him before that his face is familiar to me and yet that i cant place him the orchestra was playing the prayer from der freischutz but webers lovely music only deepened the blank of memory  who the deuce was he where when how had i known him  it seemed extraordinary that a face should be at once so familiar and so strange  we had our backs turned to him so that i could not look at him again  when the music ceased we left our places and i went to consign my friend to her mamma on the terrace  in passing i saw that my young man had departed i concluded that he only strikingly resembled some one i knew  but who in the world was it he resembled  the ladies went off to their lodgings which were near by and i turned into the gamingrooms and hovered about the circle at roulette  gradually i filtered through to the inner edge near the table and looking round saw my puzzling friend stationed opposite to me  he was watching the game with his hands in his pockets but singularly enough now that i observed him at my leisure the look of familiarity quite faded from his face  what had made us call his appearance odd was his great length and leanness of limb his long white neck his blue prominent eyes and his ingenuous unconscious absorption in the scene before him  he was not handsome certainly but he looked peculiarly amiable and if his overt wonderment savoured a trifle of rurality it was an agreeable contrast to the hard inexpressive masks about him  he was the verdant offshoot i said to myself of some ancient rigid stem he had been brought up in the quietest of homes and he was having his first glimpse of life  i was curious to see whether he would put anything on the table he evidently felt the temptation but he seemed paralysed by chronic embarrassment  he stood gazing at the chinking complexity of losses and gains shaking his loose gold in his pocket and every now and then passing his hand nervously over his eyes  most of the spectators were too attentive to the play to have many thoughts for each other but before long i noticed a lady who evidently had an eye for her neighbours as well as for the table  she was seated about halfway between my friend and me and i presently observed that she was trying to catch his eye  though at homburg as people said one could never be sure i yet doubted whether this lady were one of those whose especial vocation it was to catch a gentlemans eye  she was youthful rather than elderly and pretty rather than plain indeed a few minutes later when i saw her smile i thought her wonderfully pretty she had a charming gray eye and a good deal of yellow hair disposed in picturesque disorder and though her features were meagre and her complexion faded she gave one a sense of sentimental artificial gracefulness  she was dressed in white muslin very much puffed and filled but a trifle the worse for wear relieved here and there by a pale blue ribbon  i used to flatter myself on guessing at peoples nationality by their faces and as a rule i guessed aright  this faded crumpled vaporous beauty i conceived was a germansuch a german somehow as i had seen imagined in literature  was she not a friend of poets a correspondent of philosophers a muse a priestess of aestheticssomething in the way of a bettina a rahel  my conjectures however were speedily merged in wonderment as to what my diffident friend was making of her  she caught his eye at last and raising an ungloved hand covered altogether with bluegemmed ringsturquoises sapphires and lapisshe beckoned him to come to her  the gesture was executed with a sort of practised coolness and accompanied with an appealing smile  he stared a moment rather blankly unable to suppose that the invitation was addressed to him then as it was immediately repeated with a good deal of intensity he blushed to the roots of his hair wavered awkwardly and at last made his way to the ladys chair  by the time he reached it he was crimson and wiping his forehead with his pockethandkerchief  she tilted back looked up at him with the same smile laid two fingers on his sleeve and said something interrogatively to which he replied by a shake of the head  she was asking him evidently if he had ever played and he was saying no  old players have a fancy that when luck has turned her back on them they can put her into goodhumour again by having their stakes placed by a novice our young mans physiognomy had seemed to his new acquaintance to express the perfection of inexperience and like a practical woman she had determined to make him serve her turn  unlike most of her neighbours she had no little pile of gold before her but she drew from her pocket a double napoleon put it into his hand and bade him place it on a number of his own choosing  he was evidently filled with a sort of delightful trouble he enjoyed the adventure but he shrank from the hazard  i would have staked the coin on its being his companions last for although she still smiled intently as she watched his hesitation there was anything but indifference in her pale pretty face  suddenly in desperation he reached over and laid the piece on the table  my attention was diverted at this moment by my having to make way for a lady with a great many flounces before me to give up her chair to a rustling friend to whom she had promised it when i again looked across at the lady in white muslin she was drawing in a very goodly pile of gold with her little bluegemmed claw  good luck and bad at the homburg tables were equally undemonstrative and this happy adventuress rewarded her young friend for the sacrifice of his innocence with a single rapid upward smile  he had innocence enough left however to look round the table with a gleeful conscious laugh in the midst of which his eyes encountered my own  then suddenly the familiar look which had vanished from his face flickered up unmistakably it was the boyish laugh of a boyhoods friend  stupid fellow that i was i had been looking at eugene pickering  though i lingered on for some time longer he failed to recognise me recognition i think had kindled a smile in my own face but less fortunate than he i suppose my smile had ceased to be boyish  now that luck had faced about again his companion played for herselfplayed and won hand over hand  at last she seemed disposed to rest on her gains and proceeded to bury them in the folds of her muslin  pickering had staked nothing for himself but as he saw her prepare to withdraw he offered her a double napoleon and begged her to place it  she shook her head with great decision and seemed to bid him put it up again but he still blushing a good deal pressed her with awkward ardour and she at last took it from him looked at him a moment fixedly and laid it on a number  a moment later the croupier was raking it in  she gave the young man a little nod which seemed to say i told you so he glanced round the table again and laughed she left her chair and he made a way for her through the crowd  before going home i took a turn on the terrace and looked down on the esplanade  the lamps were out but the warm starlight vaguely illumined a dozen figures scattered in couples one of these figures i thought was a lady in a white dress  i had no intention of letting pickering go without reminding him of our old acquaintance  he had been a very singular boy and i was curious to see what had become of his singularity  i looked for him the next morning at two or three of the hotels and at last i discovered his whereabouts  but he was out the waiter said he had gone to walk an hour before  i went my way confident that i should meet him in the evening  it was the rule with the homburg world to spend its evenings at the kursaal and pickering apparently had already discovered a good reason for not being an exception  one of the charms of homburg is the fact that of a hot day you may walk about for a whole afternoon in unbroken shade  the umbrageous gardens of the kursaal mingle with the charming hardtwald which in turn melts away into the wooded slopes of the taunus mountains  to the hardtwald i bent my steps and strolled for an hour through mossy glades and the still perpendicular gloom of the firwoods  suddenly on the grassy margin of a bypath i came upon a young man stretched at his length in the suncheckered shade and kicking his heels towards a patch of blue sky  my step was so noiseless on the turf that before he saw me i had time to recognise pickering again  he looked as if he had been lounging there for some time his hair was tossed about as if he had been sleeping on the grass near him beside his hat and stick lay a sealed letter  when he perceived me he jerked himself forward and i stood looking at him without introducing myselfpurposely to give him a chance to recognise me  he put on his glasses being awkwardly nearsighted and stared up at me with an air of general trustfulness but without a sign of knowing me  so at last i introduced myself  then he jumped up and grasped my hands and stared and blushed and laughed and began a dozen random questions ending with a demand as to how in the world i had known him  why you are not changed so utterly i said and after all its but fifteen years since you used to do my latin exercises for me  not changed eh he answered still smiling and yet speaking with a sort of ingenuous dismay  then i remembered that poor pickering had been in those latin days a victim of juvenile irony  he used to bring a bottle of medicine to school and take a dose in a glass of water before lunch and every day at two oclock half an hour before the rest of us were liberated an old nurse with bushy eyebrows came and fetched him away in a carriage  his extremely fair complexion his nurse and his bottle of medicine which suggested a vague analogy with the sleepingpotion in the tragedy caused him to be called juliet  certainly romeos sweetheart hardly suffered more she was not at least a standing joke in verona  remembering these things i hastened to say to pickering that i hoped he was still the same good fellow who used to do my latin for me  we were capital friends you know i went on then and afterwards  yes we were very good friends he said and that makes it the stranger i shouldnt have known you  for you know as a boy i never had many friends nor as a man either  you see he added passing his hand over his eyes i am rather dazed rather bewildered at finding myself for the first timealone  and he jerked back his shoulders nervously and threw up his head as if to settle himself in an unwonted position  i wondered whether the old nurse with the bushy eyebrows had remained attached to his person up to a recent period and discovered presently that virtually at least she had  we had the whole summer day before us and we sat down on the grass together and overhauled our old memories  it was as if we had stumbled upon an ancient cupboard in some dusky corner and rummaged out a heap of childish playthingstin soldiers and torn storybooks jackknives and chinese puzzles  this is what we remembered between us  he had made but a short stay at schoolnot because he was tormented for he thought it so fine to be at school at all that he held his tongue at home about the sufferings incurred through the medicinebottle but because his father thought he was learning bad manners  this he imparted to me in confidence at the time and i remember how it increased my oppressive awe of mr pickering who had appeared to me in glimpses as a sort of high priest of the proprieties  mr pickering was a widowera fact which seemed to produce in him a sort of preternatural concentration of parental dignity  he was a majestic man with a hooked nose a keen dark eye very large whiskers and notions of his own as to how a boyor his boy at any rateshould be brought up  first and foremost he was to be a gentleman which seemed to mean chiefly that he was always to wear a muffler and gloves and be sent to bed after a supper of bread and milk at eight oclock  schoollife on experiment seemed hostile to these observances and eugene was taken home again to be moulded into urbanity beneath the parental eye  a tutor was provided for him and a single select companion was prescribed  the choice mysteriously fell on me born as i was under quite another star my parents were appealed to and i was allowed for a few months to have my lessons with eugene the tutor i think must have been rather a snob for eugene was treated like a prince while i got all the questions and the raps with the ruler and yet i remember never being jealous of my happier comrade and striking up for the time one of those friendships of childhood  he had a watch and a pony and a great store of picturebooks but my envy of these luxuries was tempered by a vague compassion which left me free to be generous  i could go out to play alone i could button my jacket myself and sit up till i was sleepy  poor pickering could never take a step without asking leave or spend half an hour in the garden without a formal report of it when he came in  my parents who had no desire to see me inoculated with importunate virtues sent me back to school at the end of six months  after that i never saw eugene  his father went to live in the country to protect the lads morals and eugene faded in reminiscence into a pale image of the depressing effects of education  i think i vaguely supposed that he would melt into thin air and indeed began gradually to doubt of his existence and to regard him as one of the foolish things one ceased to believe in as one grew older  it seemed natural that i should have no more news of him  our present meeting was my first assurance that he had really survived all that muffling and coddling  i observed him now with a good deal of interest for he was a rare phenomenonthe fruit of a system persistently and uninterruptedly applied  he struck me in a fashion as certain young monks i had seen in italy he had the same candid unsophisticated cloister face  his education had been really almost monastic  it had found him evidently a very compliant yielding subject his gentle affectionate spirit was not one of those that need to be broken  it had bequeathed him now that he stood on the threshold of the great world an extraordinary freshness of impression and alertness of desire and i confess that as i looked at him and met his transparent blue eye i trembled for the unwarned innocence of such a soul  i became aware gradually that the world had already wrought a certain work upon him and roused him to a restless troubled selfconsciousness  everything about him pointed to an experience from which he had been debarred his whole organism trembled with a dawning sense of unsuspected possibilities of feeling  this appealing tremor was indeed outwardly visible  he kept shifting himself about on the grass thrusting his hands through his hair wiping a light perspiration from his forehead breaking out to say something and rushing off to something else  our sudden meeting had greatly excited him and i saw that i was likely to profit by a certain overflow of sentimental fermentation  i could do so with a good conscience for all this trepidation filled me with a great friendliness  its nearly fifteen years as you say he began since you used to call me butterfingers for always missing the ball  thats a long time to give an account of and yet they have been for me such eventless monotonous years that i could almost tell their history in ten words you i suppose have had all kinds of adventures and travelled over half the world  i remember you had a turn for deeds of daring i used to think you a little captain cook in roundabouts for climbing the garden fence to get the ball when i had let it fly over  i climbed no fences then or since  you remember my father i suppose and the great care he took of me  i lost him some five months ago  from those boyish days up to his death we were always together  i dont think that in fifteen years we spent half a dozen hours apart  we lived in the country winter and summer seeing but three or four people  i had a succession of tutors and a library to browse about in i assure you i am a tremendous scholar  it was a dull life for a growing boy and a duller life for a young man grown but i never knew it  i was perfectly happy  he spoke of his father at some length and with a respect which i privately declined to emulate  mr pickering had been to my sense a frigid egotist unable to conceive of any larger vocation for his son than to strive to reproduce so irreproachable a model  i know i have been strangely brought up said my friend and that the result is something grotesque but my education piece by piece in detail became one of my fathers personal habits as it were  he took a fancy to it at first through his intense affection for my mother and the sort of worship he paid her memory  she died at my birth and as i grew up it seems that i bore an extraordinary likeness to her  besides my father had a great many theories he prided himself on his conservative opinions he thought the usual american laisseraller in education was a very vulgar practice and that children were not to grow up like dusty thorns by the wayside  so you see pickering went on smiling and blushing and yet with something of the irony of vain regret i am a regular garden plant i have been watched and watered and pruned and if there is any virtue in tending i ought to take the prize at a flower show  some three years ago my fathers health broke down and he was kept very much within doors so although i was a man grown i lived altogether at home  if i was out of his sight for a quarter of an hour he sent some one after me  he had severe attacks of neuralgia and he used to sit at his window basking in the sun  he kept an operaglass at hand and when i was out in the garden he used to watch me with it  a few days before his death i was twentyseven years old and the most innocent youth i suppose on the continent  after he died i missed him greatly pickering continued evidently with no intention of making an epigram  i stayed at home in a sort of dull stupor  it seemed as if life offered itself to me for the first time and yet as if i didnt know how to take hold of it  he uttered all this with a frank eagerness which increased as he talked and there was a singular contrast between the meagre experience he described and a certain radiant intelligence which i seemed to perceive in his glance and tone  evidently he was a clever fellow and his natural faculties were excellent  i imagined he had read a great deal and recovered in some degree in restless intellectual conjecture the freedom he was condemned to ignore in practice  opportunity was now offering a meaning to the empty forms with which his imagination was stored but it appeared to him dimly through the veil of his personal diffidence  i have not sailed round the world as you suppose i said but i confess i envy you the novelties you are going to behold  coming to homburg you have plunged in medias res  he glanced at me to see if my remark contained an allusion and hesitated a moment  yes i know it  i came to bremen in the steamer with a very friendly german who undertook to initiate me into the glories and mysteries of the fatherland  at this season he said i must begin with homburg  i landed but a fortnight ago and here i am  again he hesitated as if he were going to add something about the scene at the kursaal but suddenly nervously he took up the letter which was lying beside him looked hard at the seal with a troubled frown and then flung it back on the grass with a sigh  how long do you expect to be in europe i asked  six months i supposed when i came  but not so longnow  and he let his eyes wander to the letter again  and where shall you gowhat shall you do  everywhere everything i should have said yesterday  but now it is different  i glanced at the letterinterrogatively and he gravely picked it up and put it into his pocket  we talked for a while longer but i saw that he had suddenly become preoccupied that he was apparently weighing an impulse to break some last barrier of reserve  at last he suddenly laid his hand on my arm looked at me a moment appealingly and cried upon my word i should like to tell you everything  tell me everything by all means i answered smiling i desire nothing better than to lie here in the shade and hear everything  ah but the question is will you understand it  no matter you think me a queer fellow already  its not easy either to tell you what i feelnot easy for so queer a fellow as i to tell you in how many ways he is queer  he got up and walked away a moment passing his hand over his eyes then came back rapidly and flung himself on the grass again  i said just now i always supposed i was happy its true but now that my eyes are open i see i was only stultified  i was like a poodledog that is led about by a blue ribbon and scoured and combed and fed on slops it was not life life is learning to know ones self and in that sense i have lived more in the past six weeks than in all the years that preceded them  i am filled with this feverish sense of liberation it keeps rising to my head like the fumes of strong wine  i find i am an active sentient intelligent creature with desires with passions with possible convictionseven with what i never dreamed of a possible will of my own  i find there is a world to know a life to lead men and women to form a thousand relations with  it all lies there like a great surging sea where we must plunge and dive and feel the breeze and breast the waves  i stand shivering here on the brink staring longing wondering charmed by the smell of the brine and yet afraid of the water the world beckons and smiles and calls but a nameless influence from the past that i can neither wholly obey nor wholly resist seems to hold me back  i am full of impulses but somehow i am not full of strength life seems inspiring at certain moments but it seems terrible and unsafe and i ask myself why i should wantonly measure myself with merciless forces when i have learned so well how to stand aside and let them pass  why shouldnt i turn my back upon it all and go home towhat awaits meto that sightless soundless country life and long days spent among old books  but if a man is weak he doesnt want to assent beforehand to his weakness he wants to taste whatever sweetness there may be in paying for the knowledge  so it is that it comes backthis irresistible impulse to take my plungeto let myself swing to go where liberty leads me  he paused a moment fixing me with his excited eyes and perhaps perceived in my own an irrepressible smile at his perplexity swing ahead in heavens name you want to say and much good may it do you  i dont know whether you are laughing at my scruples or at what possibly strikes you as my depravity  i doubt he went on gravely whether i have an inclination toward wrongdoing if i have i am sure i shall not prosper in it  i honestly believe i may safely take out a license to amuse myself  but it isnt that i think of any more than i dream of playing with suffering  pleasure and pain are empty words to me what i long for is knowledgesome other knowledge than comes to us in formal colourless impersonal precept  you would understand all this better if you could breathe for an hour the musty indoor atmosphere in which i have always lived  to break a window and let in light and airi feel as if at last i must act  act by all means now and always when you have a chance i answered but dont take things too hard now or ever  your long confinement makes you think the world better worth knowing than you are likely to find it  a man with as good a head and heart as yours has a very ample world within himself and i am no believer in art for art nor in whats called life for lifes sake  nevertheless take your plunge and come and tell me whether you have found the pearl of wisdom  he frowned a little as if he thought my sympathy a trifle meagre  i shook him by the hand and laughed  the pearl of wisdom i cried is love honest love in the most convenient concentration of experience  i advise you to fall in love  he gave me no smile in response but drew from his pocket the letter of which i have spoken held it up and shook it solemnly  what is it i asked  it is my sentence  not of death i hope  of marriage  with whom  with a person i dont love  this was serious  i stopped smiling and begged him to explain  it is the singular part of my story he said at last  it will remind you of an oldfashioned romance  such as i sit here talking in this wild way and tossing off provocations to destiny my destiny is settled and sealed  i am engaged i am given in marriage  its a bequest of the pastthe past i had no hand in  the marriage was arranged by my father years ago when i was a boy  the young girls father was his particular friend he was also a widower and was bringing up his daughter on his side in the same severe seclusion in which i was spending my days  to this day i am unacquainted with the origin of the bond of union between our respective progenitors  mr vernor was largely engaged in business and i imagine that once upon a time he found himself in a financial strait and was helped through it by my fathers coming forward with a heavy loan on which in his situation he could offer no security but his word  of this my father was quite capable  he was a man of dogmas and he was sure to have a rule of lifeas clear as if it had been written out in his beautiful copperplate handadapted to the conduct of a gentleman toward a friend in pecuniary embarrassment  what is more he was sure to adhere to it  mr vernor i believe got on his feet paid his debt and vowed my father an eternal gratitude  his little daughter was the apple of his eye and he pledged himself to bring her up to be the wife of his benefactors son  so our fate was fixed parentally and we have been educated for each other  i have not seen my betrothed since she was a very plainfaced little girl in a sticky pinafore hugging a onearmed dollof the male sex i believeas big as herself  mr vernor is in what is called the eastern trade and has been living these many years at smyrna  isabel has grown up there in a whitewalled garden in an orange grove between her father and her governess  she is a good deal my junior six months ago she was seventeen when she is eighteen we are to marry  he related all this calmly enough without the accent of complaint drily rather and doggedly as if he were weary of thinking of it  its a romance indeed for these dull days i said and i heartily congratulate you  its not every young man who finds on reaching the marrying age a wife kept in a box of roseleaves for him  a thousand to one miss vernor is charming i wonder you dont post off to smyrna  you are joking he answered with a wounded air and i am terribly serious  let me tell you the rest  i never suspected this superior conspiracy till something less than a year ago  my father wishing to provide against his death informed me of it very solemnly  i was neither elated nor depressed i received it as i remember with a sort of emotion which varied only in degree from that with which i could have hailed the announcement that he had ordered me a set of new shirts  i supposed that was the way that all marriages were made i had heard of their being made in heaven and what was my father but a divinity  novels and poems indeed talked about falling in love but novels and poems were one thing and life was another  a short time afterwards he introduced me to a photograph of my predestined who has a pretty but an extremely inanimate face  after this his health failed rapidly  one night i was sitting as i habitually sat for hours in his dimlylighted room near his bed to which he had been confined for a week  he had not spoken for some time and i supposed he was asleep but happening to look at him i saw his eyes wide open and fixed on me strangely  he was smiling benignantly intensely and in a moment he beckoned to me  then on my going to himi feel that i shall not last long he said but i am willing to die when i think how comfortably i have arranged your future  he was talking of death and anything but grief at that moment was doubtless impious and monstrous but there came into my heart for the first time a throbbing sense of being overgoverned  i said nothing and he thought my silence was all sorrow  i shall not live to see you married he went on but since the foundation is laid that little signifies it would be a selfish pleasure and i have never thought of myself but in you  to foresee your future in its main outline to know to a certainty that you will be safely domiciled here with a wife approved by my judgment cultivating the moral fruit of which i have sown the seedthis will content me  but my son i wish to clear this bright vision from the shadow of a doubt  i believe in your docility i believe i may trust the salutary force of your respect for my memory  but i must remember that when i am removed you will stand here alone face to face with a hundred nameless temptations to perversity  the fumes of unrighteous pride may rise into your brain and tempt you in the interest of a vulgar theory which it will call your independence to shatter the edifice i have so laboriously constructed  so i must ask you for a promisethe solemn promise you owe my condition  and he grasped my hand  you will follow the path i have marked you will be faithful to the young girl whom an influence as devoted as that which has governed your own young life has moulded into everything amiable you will marry isabel vernor  this was pretty steep as we used to say at school  i was frightened i drew away my hand and asked to be trusted without any such terrible vow  my reluctance startled my father into a suspicion that the vulgar theory of independence had already been whispering to me he sat up in his bed and looked at me with eyes which seemed to foresee a lifetime of odious ingratitude  i felt the reproach i feel it now  i promised  and even now i dont regret my promise nor complain of my fathers tenacity  i feel somehow as if the seeds of ultimate repose had been sown in those unsuspecting yearsas if after many days i might gather the mellow fruit  but after many days  i will keep my promise i will obey but i want to live first  my dear fellow you are living now  all this passionate consciousness of your situation is a very ardent life  i wish i could say as much for my own  i want to forget my situation  i want to spend three months without thinking of the past or the future grasping whatever the present offers me  yesterday i thought i was in a fair way to sail with the tide  but this morning comes this memento  and he held up his letter again  what is it  a letter from smyrna  i see you have not yet broken the seal  no nor do i mean to for the present  it contains bad news  what do you call bad news  news that i am expected in smyrna in three weeks  news that mr vernor disapproves of my roving about the world  news that his daughter is standing expectant at the altar  is not this pure conjecture  conjecture possibly but safe conjecture  as soon as i looked at the letter something smote me at the heart  look at the device on the seal and i am sure you will find its tarry not  and he flung the letter on the grass  upon my word you had better open it i said  if i were to open it and read my summons do you know what i should do i should march home and ask the oberkellner how one gets to smyrna pack my trunk take my ticket and not stop till i arrived  i know i should it would be the fascination of habit  the only way therefore to wander to my ropes end is to leave the letter unread  in your place i said curiosity would make me open it  he shook his head  i have no curiosity  for a long time now the idea of my marriage has ceased to be a novelty and i have contemplated it mentally in every possible light  i fear nothing from that side but i do fear something from conscience  i want my hands tied  will you do me a favour  pick up the letter put it into your pocket and keep it till i ask you for it  when i do you may know that i am at my ropes end  i took the letter smiling  and how long is your rope to be  the homburg season doesnt last for ever  does it last a month  let that be my season  a month hence you will give it back to me  tomorrow if you say so  meanwhile let it rest in peace  and i consigned it to the most sacred interstice of my pocketbook  to say that i was disposed to humour the poor fellow would seem to be saying that i thought his request fantastic  it was his situation by no fault of his own that was fantastic and he was only trying to be natural  he watched me put away the letter and when it had disappeared gave a soft sigh of relief  the sigh was natural and yet it set me thinking  his general recoil from an immediate responsibility imposed by others might be wholesome enough but if there was an old grievance on one side was there not possibly a newborn delusion on the other  it would be unkind to withhold a reflection that might serve as a warning so i told him abruptly that i had been an undiscovered spectator the night before of his exploits at roulette  he blushed deeply but he met my eyes with the same clear goodhumour  ah then you saw that wonderful lady  wonderful she was indeed  i saw her afterwards too sitting on the terrace in the starlight  i imagine she was not alone  no indeed i was with herfor nearly an hour  then i walked home with her  ah  and did you go in  no she said it was too late to ask me though she remarked that in a general way she did not stand upon ceremony  she did herself injustice  when it came to losing your money for you she made you insist  ah you noticed that too cried pickering still quite unconfused  i felt as if the whole table were staring at me but her manner was so gracious and reassuring that i supposed she was doing nothing unusual she confessed however afterwards that she is very eccentric  the world began to call her so she said before she ever dreamed of it and at last finding that she had the reputation in spite of herself she resolved to enjoy its privileges  now she does what she chooses  in other words she is a lady with no reputation to lose  pickering seemed puzzled he smiled a little is not that what you say of bad women  of someof those who are found out  well he said still smiling i have not yet found out madame blumenthal  if thats her name i suppose shes german  yes but she speaks english so well that you wouldnt know it  she is very clever  her husband is dead  i laughed involuntarily at the conjunction of these facts and pickerings clear glance seemed to question my mirth  you have been so bluntly frank with me i said that i too must be frank  tell me if you can whether this clever madame blumenthal whose husband is dead has given a point to your desire for a suspension of communication with smyrna  he seemed to ponder my question unshrinkingly  i think not he said at last  i have had the desire for three months i have known madame blumenthal for less than twentyfour hours  very true  but when you found this letter of yours on your place at breakfast did you seem for a moment to see madame blumenthal sitting opposite  opposite  opposite my dear fellow or anywhere in the neighbourhood  in a word does she interest you  very much he cried joyously  amen i answered jumping up with a laugh  and now if we are to see the world in a month there is no time to lose  let us begin with the hardtwald  pickering rose and we strolled away into the forest talking of lighter things  at last we reached the edge of the wood sat down on a fallen log and looked out across an interval of meadow at the long wooded waves of the taunus  what my friend was thinking of i cant say i was meditating on his queer biography and letting my wonderment wander away to smyrna  suddenly i remembered that he possessed a portrait of the young girl who was waiting for him there in a whitewalled garden  i asked him if he had it with him  he said nothing but gravely took out his pocketbook and drew forth a small photograph  it represented as the poet says a simple maiden in her flowera slight young girl with a certain childish roundness of contour  there was no ease in her posture she was standing stiffly and shyly for her likeness she wore a short waisted white dress her arms hung at her sides and her hands were clasped in front her head was bent downward a little and her dark eyes fixed  but her awkwardness was as pretty as that of some angular seraph in a mediaeval carving and in her timid gaze there seemed to lurk the questioning gleam of childhood  what is this for her charming eyes appeared to ask why have i been dressed up for this ceremony in a white frock and amber beads  gracious powers i said to myself what an enchanting thing is innocence  that portrait was taken a year and a half ago said pickering as if with an effort to be perfectly just  by this time i suppose she looks a little wiser  not much i hope i said as i gave it back  she is very sweet  yes poor girl she is very sweetno doubt  and he put the thing away without looking at it  we were silent for some moments  at last abruptlymy dear fellow i said i should take some satisfaction in seeing you immediately leave homburg  immediately  todayas soon as you can get ready  he looked at me surprised and little by little he blushed  there is something i have not told you he said something that your saying that madame blumenthal has no reputation to lose has made me half afraid to tell you  i think i can guess it  madame blumenthal has asked you to come and play her game for her again  not at all cried pickering with a smile of triumph  she says that she means to play no more for the present  she has asked me to come and take tea with her this evening  ah then i said very gravely of course you cant leave homburg  he answered nothing but looked askance at me as if he were expecting me to laugh  urge it strongly he said in a moment  say its my dutythat i must  i didnt quite understand him but feathering the shaft with a harmless expletive i told him that unless he followed my advice i would never speak to him again  he got up stood before me and struck the ground with his stick  good he cried i wanted an occasion to break a ruleto leap a barrier  here it is  i stay  i made him a mock bow for his energy  thats very fine i said but now to put you in a proper mood for madame blumenthals tea we will go and listen to the band play schubert under the lindens  and we walked back through the woods  i went to see pickering the next day at his inn and on knocking as directed at his door was surprised to hear the sound of a loud voice within  my knock remained unnoticed so i presently introduced myself  i found no company but i discovered my friend walking up and down the room and apparently declaiming to himself from a little volume bound in white vellum  he greeted me heartily threw his book on the table and said that he was taking a german lesson  and who is your teacher i asked glancing at the book  he rather avoided meeting my eye as he answered after an instants delay madame blumenthal  indeed  has she written a grammar  its not a grammar its a tragedy  and he handed me the book  i opened it and beheld in delicate type with a very large margin an historisches trauerspiel in five acts entitled cleopatra  there were a great many marginal corrections and annotations apparently from the authors hand the speeches were very long and there was an inordinate number of soliloquies by the heroine  one of them i remember towards the end of the play began in this fashion  what after all is life but sensation and sensation but deceptionreality that pales before the light of ones dreams as octavias dull beauty fades beside mine  but let me believe in some intenser bliss and seek it in the arms of death  it seems decidedly passionate i said  has the tragedy ever been acted  never in public but madame blumenthal tells me that she had it played at her own house in berlin and that she herself undertook the part of the heroine  pickerings unworldly life had not been of a sort to sharpen his perception of the ridiculous but it seemed to me an unmistakable sign of his being under the charm that this information was very soberly offered  he was preoccupied he was irresponsive to my experimental observations on vulgar topicsthe hot weather the inn the advent of adelina patti  at last uttering his thoughts he announced that madame blumenthal had proved to be an extraordinarily interesting woman  he seemed to have quite forgotten our long talk in the hartwaldt and betrayed no sense of this being a confession that he had taken his plunge and was floating with the current  he only remembered that i had spoken slightingly of the lady and he now hinted that it behoved me to amend my opinion  i had received the day before so strong an impression of a sort of spiritual fastidiousness in my friends nature that on hearing now the striking of a new hour as it were in his consciousness and observing how the echoes of the past were immediately quenched in its music i said to myself that it had certainly taken a delicate hand to wind up that fine machine  no doubt madame blumenthal was a clever woman  it is a good german custom at homburg to spend the hour preceding dinner in listening to the orchestra in the kurgarten mozart and beethoven for organisms in which the interfusion of soul and sense is peculiarly mysterious are a vigorous stimulus to the appetite  pickering and i conformed as we had done the day before to the fashion and when we were seated under the trees he began to expatiate on his friends merits  i dont know whether she is eccentric or not he said to me every one seems eccentric and its not for me yet a while to measure people by my narrow precedents  i never saw a gaming table in my life before and supposed that a gambler was of necessity some dusky villain with an evil eye  in germany says madame blumenthal people play at roulette as they play at billiards and her own venerable mother originally taught her the rules of the game  it is a recognised source of subsistence for decent people with small means  but i confess madame blumenthal might do worse things than play at roulette and yet make them harmonious and beautiful i have never been in the habit of thinking positive beauty the most excellent thing in a woman  i have always said to myself that if my heart were ever to be captured it would be by a sort of general gracea sweetness of motion and toneon which one could count for soothing impressions as one counts on a musical instrument that is perfectly in tune  madame blumenthal has itthis grace that soothes and satisfies and it seems the more perfect that it keeps order and harmony in a character really passionately ardent and active  with her eager nature and her innumerable accomplishments nothing would be easier than that she should seem restless and aggressive  you will know her and i leave you to judge whether she does seem so  she has every gift and culture has done everything for each  what goes on in her mind i of course cant say what reaches the observerthe admireris simply a sort of fragrant emanation of intelligence and sympathy  madame blumenthal i said smiling might be the loveliest woman in the world and you the object of her choicest favours and yet what i should most envy you would be not your peerless friend but your beautiful imagination  thats a polite way of calling me a fool said pickering  you are a sceptic a cynic a satirist  i hope i shall be a long time coming to that  you will make the journey fast if you travel by express trains  but pray tell me have you ventured to intimate to madame blumenthal your high opinion of her  i dont know what i may have said  she listens even better than she talks and i think it possible i may have made her listen to a great deal of nonsense  for after the first few words i exchanged with her i was conscious of an extraordinary evaporation of all my old diffidence  i have in truth i suppose he added in a moment owing to my peculiar circumstances a great accumulated fund of unuttered things of all sorts to get rid of  last evening sitting there before that charming woman they came swarming to my lips  very likely i poured them all out  i have a sense of having enshrouded myself in a sort of mist of talk and of seeing her lovely eyes shining through it opposite to me like fog lamps at sea  and here if i remember rightly pickering broke off into an ardent parenthesis and declared that madame blumenthals eyes had something in them that he had never seen in any others  it was a jumble of crudities and inanities he went on they must have seemed to her great rubbish but i felt the wiser and the stronger somehow for having fired off all my gunsthey could hurt nobody now if they hitand i imagine i might have gone far without finding another woman in whom such an exhibition would have provoked so little of mere cold amusement  madame blumenthal on the contrary i surmised entered into your situation with warmth  exactly sothe greatest  she has felt and suffered and now she understands  she told you i imagine that she understood you as if she had made you and she offered to be your guide philosopher and friend  she spoke to me pickering answered after a pause as i had never been spoken to before and she offered me formally all the offices of a womans friendship  which you as formally accepted  to you the scene sounds absurd i suppose but allow me to say i dont care  pickering spoke with an air of genial defiance which was the most inoffensive thing in the world  i was very much moved i was in fact very much excited  i tried to say something but i couldnt i had had plenty to say before but now i stammered and bungled and at last i bolted out of the room  meanwhile she had dropped her tragedy into your pocket  not at all  i had seen it on the table before she came in  afterwards she kindly offered to read german aloud with me for the accent two or three times a week  what shall we begin with she asked  with this i said and held up the book  and she let me take it to look it over  i was neither a cynic nor a satirist but even if i had been i might have been disarmed by pickerings assurance before we parted that madame blumenthal wished to know me and expected him to introduce me among the foolish things which according to his own account he had uttered were some generous words in my praise to which she had civilly replied  i confess i was curious to see her but i begged that the introduction should not be immediate for i wished to let pickering work out his destiny alone  for some days i saw little of him though we met at the kursaal and strolled occasionally in the park  i watched in spite of my desire to let him alone for the signs and portents of the worlds action upon himof that portion of the world in especial of which madame blumenthal had constituted herself the agent  he seemed very happy and gave me in a dozen ways an impression of increased self confidence and maturity  his mind was admirably active and always after a quarter of an hours talk with him i asked myself what experience could really do that innocence had not done to make it bright and fine  i was struck with his deep enjoyment of the whole spectacle of foreign lifeits novelty its picturesqueness its light and shadeand with the infinite freedom with which he felt he could go and come and rove and linger and observe it all  it was an expansion an awakening a coming to moral manhood  each time i met him he spoke a little less of madame blumenthal but he let me know generally that he saw her often and continued to admire her  i was forced to admit to myself in spite of preconceptions that if she were really the ruling star of this happy season she must be a very superior woman  pickering had the air of an ingenuous young philosopher sitting at the feet of an austere muse and not of a sentimental spendthrift dangling about some supreme incarnation of levity     chapter ii   madame blumenthal seemed for the time to have abjured the kursaal and i never caught a glimpse of her  her young friend apparently was an interesting study and the studious mind prefers seclusion  she reappeared however at last one evening at the opera where from my chair i perceived her in a box looking extremely pretty  adelina patti was singing and after the rising of the curtain i was occupied with the stage but on looking round when it fell for the entracte i saw that the authoress of cleopatra had been joined by her young admirer  he was sitting a little behind her leaning forward looking over her shoulder and listening while she slowly moving her fan to and fro and letting her eye wander over the house was apparently talking of this person and that  no doubt she was saying sharp things but pickering was not laughing his eyes were following her covert indications his mouth was half open as it always was when he was interested he looked intensely serious  i was glad that having her back to him she was unable to see how he looked  it seemed the proper moment to present myself and make her my bow but just as i was about to leave my place a gentleman whom in a moment i perceived to be an old acquaintance came to occupy the next chair  recognition and mutual greetings followed and i was forced to postpone my visit to madame blumenthal  i was not sorry for it very soon occurred to me that niedermeyer would be just the man to give me a fair prose version of pickerings lyric tributes to his friend he was an austrian by birth and had formerly lived about europe a great deal in a series of small diplomatic posts  england especially he had often visited and he spoke the language almost without accent  i had once spent three rainy days with him in the house of an english friend in the country  he was a sharp observer and a good deal of a gossip he knew a little something about every one and about some people everything  his knowledge on social matters generally had the quality of all german science it was copious minute exhaustive  do tell me i said as we stood looking round the house who and what is the lady in white with the young man sitting behind her  who he answered dropping his glass  madame blumenthal  what  it would take long to say  be introduced its easily done you will find her charming  then after a week you will tell me what she is  perhaps i should not  my friend there has known her a week and i dont think he is yet able to give a coherent account of her  he raised his glass again and after looking a while i am afraid your friend is a littlewhat do you call ita little soft  poor fellow hes not the first  i have never known this lady that she has not had some eligible youth hovering about in some such attitude as that undergoing the softening process  she looks wonderfully well from here its extraordinary how those women last  you dont mean i take it when you talk about those women that madame blumenthal is not embalmed for duration in a certain infusion of respectability  yes and no  the atmosphere that surrounds her is entirely of her own making  there is no reason in her antecedents that people should drop their voice when they speak of her  but some women are never at their ease till they have given some damnable twist or other to their position before the world  the attitude of upright virtue is unbecoming like sitting too straight in a fauteuil  dont ask me for opinions however content yourself with a few facts and with an anecdote  madame blumenthal is prussian and very well born  i remember her mother an old westphalian grafin with principles marshalled out like frederick the greats grenadiers  she was poor however and her principles were an insufficient dowry for anastasia who was married very young to a vicious jew twice her own age  he was supposed to have money but i am afraid he had less than was nominated in the bond or else that his pretty young wife spent it very fast  she has been a widow these six or eight years and has lived i imagine in rather a handtomouth fashion  i suppose she is some six or eight and thirty years of age  in winter one hears of her in berlin giving little suppers to the artistic rabble there in summer one often sees her across the green table at ems and wiesbaden shes very clever and her cleverness has spoiled her  a year after her marriage she published a novel with her views on matrimony in the george sand mannerbeating the drum to madame sands trumpet  no doubt she was very unhappy blumenthal was an old beast  since then she has published a lot of literaturenovels and poems and pamphlets on every conceivable theme from the conversion of lola montez to the hegelian philosophy  her talk is much better than her writing  her conjugophobiai cant call it by any other namemade people think lightly of her at a time when her rebellion against marriage was probably only theoretic  she had a taste for spinning fine phrases she drove her shuttle and when she came to the end of her yarn she found that society had turned its back  she tossed her head declared that at last she could breathe the sacred air of freedom and formally announced that she had embraced an intellectual life  this meant unlimited camaraderie with scribblers and daubers hegelian philosophers and hungarian pianists  but she has been admired also by a great many really clever men there was a time in fact when she turned a head as well set on its shoulders as this one  and niedermeyer tapped his forehead  she has a great charm and literally i know no harm of her  yet for all that i am not going to speak to her i am not going near her box  i am going to leave her to say if she does me the honour to observe the omission that i too have gone over to the philistines  its not that it is that there is something sinister about the woman  i am too old for it to frighten me but i am goodnatured enough for it to pain me  her quarrel with society has brought her no happiness and her outward charm is only the mask of a dangerous discontent  her imagination is lodged where her heart should be  so long as you amuse it well and good shes radiant but the moment you let it flag she is capable of dropping you without a pang  if you land on your feet you are so much the wiser simply but there have been two or three i believe who have almost broken their necks in the fall  you are reversing your promise i said and giving me an opinion but not an anecdote  this is my anecdote  a year ago a friend of mine made her acquaintance in berlin and though he was no longer a young man and had never been what is called a susceptible one he took a great fancy to madame blumenthal  hes a major in the prussian artillerygrizzled grave a trifle severe a man every way firm in the faith of his fathers  its a proof of anastasias charm that such a man should have got into the habit of going to see her every day of his life  but the major was in love or next door to it  every day that he called he found her scribbling away at a little ormolu table on a lot of halfsheets of notepaper  she used to bid him sit down and hold his tongue for a quarter of an hour till she had finished her chapter she was writing a novel and it was promised to a publisher  clorinda she confided to him was the name of the injured heroine  the major i imagine had never read a work of fiction in his life but he knew by hearsay that madame blumenthals literature when put forth in pink covers was subversive of several respectable institutions  besides he didnt believe in women knowing how to write at all and it irritated him to see this inky goddess correcting proofsheets under his noseirritated him the more that as i say he was in love with her and that he ventured to believe she had a kindness for his years and his honours  and yet she was not such a woman as he could easily ask to marry him  the result of all this was that he fell into the way of railing at her intellectual pursuits and saying he should like to run his sword through her pile of papers  a woman was clever enough when she could guess her husbands wishes and learned enough when she could read him the newspapers  at last one day madame blumenthal flung down her pen and announced in triumph that she had finished her novel  clorinda had expired in the arms ofsome one else than her husband  the major by way of congratulating her declared that her novel was immoral rubbish and that her love of vicious paradoxes was only a peculiarly depraved form of coquetry  he added however that he loved her in spite of her follies and that if she would formally abjure them he would as formally offer her his hand  they say that women like to be snubbed by military men  i dont know im sure i dont know how much pleasure on this occasion was mingled with anastasias wrath  but her wrath was very quiet and the major assured me it made her look uncommonly pretty  i have told you before she says that i write from an inner need  i write to unburden my heart to satisfy my conscience  you call my poor efforts coquetry vanity the desire to produce a sensation  i can prove to you that it is the quiet labour itself i care for and not the worlds more or less flattering attention to it  and seizing the history of clorinda she thrust it into the fire the major stands staring and the first thing he knows she is sweeping him a great curtsey and bidding him farewell for ever  left alone and recovering his wits he fishes out clorinda from the embers and then proceeds to thump vigorously at the ladys door  but it never opened and from that day to the day three months ago when he told me the tale he had not beheld her again  by jove its a striking story i said  but the question is what does it prove  several things  first what i was careful not to tell my friend that madame blumenthal cared for him a trifle more than he supposed second that he cares for her more than ever third that the performance was a masterstroke and that her allowing him to force an interview upon her again is only a question of time  and last i asked  this is another anecdote  the other day unter den linden i saw on a booksellers counter a little pinkcovered romancesophronia by madame blumenthal  glancing through it i observed an extraordinary abuse of asterisks every two or three pages the narrative was adorned with a portentous blank crossed with a row of stars  well but poor clorinda i objected as niedermeyer paused  sophronia my dear fellow is simply clorinda renamed by the baptism of fire  the fair author came back of course and found clorinda tumbled upon the floor a good deal scorched but on the whole more frightened than hurt  she picks her up brushes her off and sends her to the printer  wherever the flames had burnt a hole she swings a constellation  but if the major is prepared to drop a penitent tear over the ashes of clorinda i shall not whisper to him that the urn is empty  even adelina pattis singing for the next halfhour but half availed to divert me from my quickened curiosity to behold madame blumenthal face to face  as soon as the curtain had fallen again i repaired to her box and was ushered in by pickering with zealous hospitality  his glowing smile seemed to say to me ay look for yourself and adore  nothing could have been more gracious than the ladys greeting and i found somewhat to my surprise that her prettiness lost nothing on a nearer view  her eyes indeed were the finest i have ever seenthe softest the deepest the most intensely responsive  in spite of something faded and jaded in her physiognomy her movements her smile and the tone of her voice especially when she laughed had an almost girlish frankness and spontaneity  she looked at you very hard with her radiant gray eyes and she indulged while she talked in a superabundance of restless rather affected little gestures as if to make you take her meaning in a certain very particular and superfine sense  i wondered whether after a while this might not fatigue ones attention then meeting her charming eyes i said not for a long time  she was very clever and as pickering had said she spoke english admirably  i told her as i took my seat beside her of the fine things i had heard about her from my friend and she listened letting me go on some time and exaggerate a little with her fine eyes fixed full upon me  really she suddenly said turning short round upon pickering who stood behind us and looking at him in the same way  is that the way you talk about me  he blushed to his eyes and i repented  she suddenly began to laugh it was then i observed how sweet her voice was in laughter  we talked after this of various matters and in a little while i complimented her on her excellent english and asked if she had learnt it in england  heaven forbid she cried  i have never been there and wish never to go  i should never get on with the i wondered what she was going to say the fogs the smoke or whist with sixpenny stakesi should never get on she said with the aristocracy  i am a fierce democrati am not ashamed of it  i hold opinions which would make my ancestors turn in their graves  i was born in the lap of feudalism  i am a daughter of the crusaders  but i am a revolutionist  i have a passion for freedommy idea of happiness is to die on a great barricade  its to your great country i should like to go  i should like to see the wonderful spectacle of a great people free to do everything it chooses and yet never doing anything wrong  i replied modestly that after all both our freedom and our good conduct had their limits and she turned quickly about and shook her fan with a dramatic gesture at pickering  no matter no matter she cried i should like to see the country which produced that wonderful young man  i think of it as a sort of arcadiaa land of the golden age  hes so delightfully innocent  in this stupid old germany if a young man is innocent hes a fool he has no brains hes not a bit interesting  but mr pickering says the freshest things and after i have laughed five minutes at their freshness it suddenly occurs to me that they are very wise and i think them over for a week  true she went on nodding at him  i call them inspired solecisms and i treasure them up  remember that when i next laugh at you  glancing at pickering i was prompted to believe that he was in a state of beatific exaltation which weighed madame blumenthals smiles and frowns in an equal balance  they were equally hers they were links alike in the golden chain  he looked at me with eyes that seemed to say did you ever hear such wit  did you ever see such grace  it seemed to me that he was but vaguely conscious of the meaning of her words her gestures her voice and glance made an absorbing harmony  there is something painful in the spectacle of absolute enthralment even to an excellent cause  i gave no response to pickerings challenge but made some remark upon the charm of adelina pattis singing  madame blumenthal as became a revolutionist was obliged to confess that she could see no charm in it it was meagre it was trivial it lacked soul you must know that in music too she said i think for myself  and she began with a great many flourishes of her fan to explain what it was she thought  remarkable things doubtless but i cannot answer for it for in the midst of the explanation the curtain rose again  you cant be a great artist without a great passion  madame blumenthal was affirming  before i had time to assent madame pattis voice rose wheeling like a skylark and rained down its silver notes  ah give me that art i whispered and i will leave you your passion  and i departed for my own place in the orchestra  i wondered afterwards whether the speech had seemed rude and inferred that it had not on receiving a friendly nod from the lady in the lobby as the theatre was emptying itself  she was on pickerings arm and he was taking her to her carriage  distances are short in homburg but the night was rainy and madame blumenthal exhibited a very pretty satinshod foot as a reason why though but a penniless widow she should not walk home  pickering left us together a moment while he went to hail the vehicle and my companion seized the opportunity as she said to beg me to be so very kind as to come and see her  it was for a particular reason  it was reason enough for me of course i answered that she had given me leave she looked at me a moment with that extraordinary gaze of hers which seemed so absolutely audacious in its candour and rejoined that i paid more compliments than our young friend there but that she was sure i was not half so sincere  but its about him i want to talk she said  i want to ask you many things i want you to tell me all about him  he interests me but you see my sympathies are so intense my imagination is so lively that i dont trust my own impressions  they have misled me more than once  and she gave a little tragic shudder  i promised to come and compare notes with her and we bade her farewell at her carriage door  pickering and i remained a while walking up and down the long glazed gallery of the kursaal  i had not taken many steps before i became aware that i was beside a man in the very extremity of love  isnt she wonderful he asked with an implicit confidence in my sympathy which it cost me some ingenuity to elude  if he were really in love well and good  for although now that i had seen her i stood ready to confess to large possibilities of fascination on madame blumenthals part and even to certain possibilities of sincerity of which my appreciation was vague yet it seemed to me less ominous that he should be simply smitten than that his admiration should pique itself on being discriminating  it was on his fundamental simplicity that i counted for a happy termination of his experiment and the former of these alternatives seemed to me the simpler  i resolved to hold my tongue and let him run his course  he had a great deal to say about his happiness about the days passing like hours the hours like minutes and about madame blumenthal being a revelation  she was nothing tonight he said nothing to what she sometimes is in the way of brilliancyin the way of repartee  if you could only hear her when she tells her adventures  adventures i inquired  has she had adventures  of the most wonderful sort cried pickering with rapture she hasnt vegetated like me  she has lived in the tumult of life  when i listen to her reminiscences its like hearing the opening tumult of one of beethovens symphonies as it loses itself in a triumphant harmony of beauty and faith  i could only lift my eyebrows but i desired to know before we separated what he had done with that troublesome conscience of his  i suppose you know my dear fellow i said that you are simply in love  thats what they happen to call your state of mind  he replied with a brightening eye as if he were delighted to hear itso madame blumenthal told me only this morning  and seeing i suppose that i was slightly puzzled i went to drive with her he continued we drove to konigstein to see the old castle  we scrambled up into the heart of the ruin and sat for an hour in one of the crumbling old courts something in the solemn stillness of the place unloosed my tongue and while she sat on an ivied stone on the edge of the plunging wall i stood there and made a speech  she listened to me looking at me breaking off little bits of stone and letting them drop down into the valley  at last she got up and nodded at me two or three times silently with a smile as if she were applauding me for a solo on the violin  you are in love she said  its a perfect case  and for some time she said nothing more  but before we left the place she told me that she owed me an answer to my speech  she thanked me heartily but she was afraid that if she took me at my word she would be taking advantage of my inexperience  i had known few women i was too easily pleased i thought her better than she really was  she had great faults i must know her longer and find them out i must compare her with other womenwomen younger simpler more innocent more ignorant and then if i still did her the honour to think well of her she would listen to me again  i told her that i was not afraid of preferring any woman in the world to her and then she repeated happy man happy man you are in love you are in love  i called upon madame blumenthal a couple of days later in some agitation of thought  it has been proved that there are here and there in the world such people as sincere impostors certain characters who cultivate fictitious emotions in perfect good faith  even if this clever lady enjoyed poor pickerings bedazzlement it was conceivable that taking vanity and charity together she should care more for his welfare than for her own entertainment and her offer to abide by the result of hazardous comparison with other women was a finer stroke than her reputation had led me to expect  she received me in a shabby little sittingroom littered with uncut books and newspapers many of which i saw at a glance were french  one side of it was occupied by an open piano surmounted by a jar full of white roses  they perfumed the air they seemed to me to exhale the pure aroma of pickerings devotion buried in an armchair the object of this devotion was reading the revue des deux mondes  the purpose of my visit was not to admire madame blumenthal on my own account but to ascertain how far i might safely leave her to work her will upon my friend  she had impugned my sincerity the evening of the opera and i was careful on this occasion to abstain from compliments and not to place her on her guard against my penetration  it is needless to narrate our interview in detail indeed to tell the perfect truth i was punished for my rash attempt to surprise her by a temporary eclipse of my own perspicacity  she sat there so questioning so perceptive so genial so generous and so pretty withal that i was quite ready at the end of half an hour to subscribe to the most comprehensive of pickerings rhapsodies  she was certainly a wonderful woman  i have never liked to linger in memory on that half hour  the result of it was to prove that there were many more things in the composition of a woman who as niedermeyer said had lodged her imagination in the place of her heart than were dreamt of in my philosophy  yet as i sat there stroking my hat and balancing the account between nature and art in my affable hostess i felt like a very competent philosopher  she had said she wished me to tell her everything about our friend and she questioned me as to his family his fortune his antecedents and his character  all this was natural in a woman who had received a passionate declaration of love and it was expressed with an air of charmed solicitude a radiant confidence that there was really no mistake about his being a most distinguished young man and that if i chose to be explicit i might deepen her conviction to disinterested ecstasy which might have almost provoked me to invent a good opinion if i had not had one ready made  i told her that she really knew pickering better than i did and that until we met at homburg i had not seen him since he was a boy  but he talks to you freely she answered i know you are his confidant  he has told me certainly a great many things but i always feel as if he were keeping something back as if he were holding something behind him and showing me only one hand at once  he seems often to be hovering on the edge of a secret  i have had several friendships in my lifethank heaven but i have had none more dear to me than this one  yet in the midst of it i have the painful sense of my friend being half afraid of me of his thinking me terrible strange perhaps a trifle out of my wits  poor me  if he only knew what a plain good soul i am and how i only want to know him and befriend him  these words were full of a plaintive magnanimity which made mistrust seem cruel  how much better i might play providence over pickerings experiments with life if i could engage the fine instincts of this charming woman on the providential side  pickerings secret was of course his engagement to miss vernor it was natural enough that he should have been unable to bring himself to talk of it to madame blumenthal  the simple sweetness of this young girls face had not faded from my memory i could not rid myself of the suspicion that in going further pickering might fare much worse  madame blumenthals professions seemed a virtual promise to agree with me and after some hesitation i said that my friend had in fact a substantial secret and that perhaps i might do him a good turn by putting her in possession of it  in as few words as possible i told her that pickering stood pledged by filial piety to marry a young lady at smyrna  she listened intently to my story when i had finished it there was a faint flush of excitement in each of her cheeks  she broke out into a dozen exclamations of admiration and compassion  what a wonderful talewhat a romantic situation  no wonder poor mr pickering seemed restless and unsatisfied no wonder he wished to put off the day of submission  and the poor little girl at smyrna waiting there for the young western prince like the heroine of an eastern tale  she would give the world to see her photograph did i think mr pickering would show it to her  but never fear she would ask nothing indiscreet  yes it was a marvellous story and if she had invented it herself people would have said it was absurdly improbable she left her seat and took several turns about the room smiling to herself and uttering little german cries of wonderment  suddenly she stopped before the piano and broke into a little laugh the next moment she buried her face in the great bouquet of roses  it was time i should go but i was indisposed to leave her without obtaining some definite assurance that as far as pity was concerned she pitied the young girl at smyrna more than the young man at homburg  of course you know what i wished in telling you this i said rising she is evidently a charming creature and the best thing he can do is to marry her  i wished to interest you in that view of it  she had taken one of the roses from the vase and was arranging it in the front of her dress  suddenly looking up leave it to me leave it to me she cried  i am interested  and with her little bluegemmed hand she tapped her forehead  i am deeply interested  and with this i had to content myself  but more than once the next day i repented of my zeal and wondered whether a providence with a white rose in her bosom might not turn out a trifle too human  in the evening at the kursaal i looked for pickering but he was not visible and i reflected that my revelation had not as yet at any rate seemed to madame blumenthal a reason for prescribing a coolingterm to his passion very late as i was turning away i saw him arrivewith no small satisfaction for i had determined to let him know immediately in what way i had attempted to serve him  but he straightway passed his arm through my own and led me off towards the gardens  i saw that he was too excited to allow me to speak first  i have burnt my ships he cried when we were out of earshot of the crowd  i have told her everything  i have insisted that its simple torture for me to wait with this idle view of loving her less  its well enough for her to ask it but i feel strong enough now to override her reluctance  i have cast off the millstone from round my neck  i care for nothing i know nothing but that i love her with every pulse of my beingand that everything else has been a hideous dream from which she may wake me into blissful morning with a single word  i held him off at armslength and looked at him gravely  you have told her you mean of your engagement to miss vernor  the whole story  i have given it upi have thrown it to the winds  i have broken utterly with the past  it may rise in its grave and give me its curse but it cant frighten me now  i have a right to be happy i have a right to be free i have a right not to bury myself alive  it was not i who promisedi was not born then  i myself my soul my mind my optionall this is but a month old  ah he went on if you knew the difference it makesthis having chosen and broken and spoken  i am twice the man i was yesterday  yesterday i was afraid of her there was a kind of mocking mystery of knowledge and cleverness about her which oppressed me in the midst of my love  but now i am afraid of nothing but of being too happy  i stood silent to let him spend his eloquence  but he paused a moment and took off his hat and fanned himself  let me perfectly understand i said at last  you have asked madame blumenthal to be your wife  the wife of my intelligent choice  and does she consent  she asks three days to decide  call it four  she has known your secret since this morning  i am bound to let you know i told her  so much the better cried pickering without apparent resentment or surprise  its not a brilliant offer for such a woman and in spite of what i have at stake i feel that it would be brutal to press her  what does she say to your breaking your promise i asked in a moment  pickering was too much in love for false shame  she tells me that she loves me too much to find courage to condemn me  she agrees with me that i have a right to be happy  i ask no exemption from the common law  what i claim is simply freedom to try to be  of course i was puzzled it was not in that fashion that i had expected madame blumenthal to make use of my information  but the matter now was quite out of my hands and all i could do was to bid my companion not work himself into a fever over either fortune  the next day i had a visit from niedermeyer on whom after our talk at the opera i had left a card  we gossiped a while and at last he said suddenly by the way i have a sequel to the history of clorinda  the major is at homburg  indeed said i  since when  these three days  and what is he doing  he seems said niedermeyer with a laugh to be chiefly occupied in sending flowers to madame blumenthal  that is i went with him the morning of his arrival to choose a nosegay and nothing would suit him but a small haystack of white roses  i hope it was received  i can assure you it was i cried  i saw the lady fairly nestling her head in it  but i advise the major not to build upon that  he has a rival  do you mean the soft young man of the other night  pickering is soft if you will but his softness seems to have served him  he has offered her everything and she has not yet refused it  i had handed my visitor a cigar and he was puffing it in silence  at last he abruptly asked if i had been introduced to madame blumenthal and on my affirmative inquired what i thought of her  i will not tell you i said or youll call me soft  he knocked away his ashes eyeing me askance  i have noticed your friend about he said and even if you had not told me i should have known he was in love  after he has left his adored his face wears for the rest of the day the expression with which he has risen from her feet and more than once i have felt like touching his elbow as you would that of a man who has inadvertently come into a drawingroom in his overshoes you say he has offered our friend everything but my dear fellow he has not everything to offer her  he evidently is as amiable as the morning but the lady has no taste for daylight  i assure you pickering is a very interesting fellow i said  ah there it is  has he not some story or other  isnt he an orphan or a natural child or consumptive or contingent heir to great estates she will read his little story to the end and close the book very tenderly and smooth down the cover and then when he least expects it she will toss it into the dusty limbo of her other romances  she will let him dangle but she will let him drop  upon my word i cried with heat if she does she will be a very unprincipled little creature  niedermeyer shrugged his shoulders  i never said she was a saint  shrewd as i felt niedermeyer to be i was not prepared to take his simple word for this event and in the evening i received a communication which fortified my doubts  it was a note from pickering and it ran as follows     my dear friendi have every hope of being happy but i am to go to    wiesbaden to learn my fate  madame blumenthal goes thither this    afternoon to spend a few days and she allows me to accompany her    give me your good wishes you shall hear of the result    e p  one of the diversions of homburg for newcomers is to dine in rotation at the different tables dhote  it so happened that a couple of days later niedermeyer took potluck at my hotel and secured a seat beside my own  as we took our places i found a letter on my plate and as it was postmarked wiesbaden i lost no time in opening it  it contained but three lines     i am happyi am acceptedan hour ago  i can hardly believe its    your poor friend    e p  i placed the note before niedermeyer not exactly in triumph but with the alacrity of all felicitous confutation  he looked at it much longer than was needful to read it stroking down his beard gravely and i felt it was not so easy to confute a pupil of the school of metternich  at last folding the note and handing it back has your friend mentioned madame blumenthals errand at wiesbaden he asked  you look very wise  i give it up said i  she is gone there to make the major follow her  he went by the next train  and has the major on his side dropped you a line  he is not a letterwriter  well said i pocketing my letter with this document in my hand i am bound to reserve my judgment  we will have a bottle of johannisberg and drink to the triumph of virtue  for a whole week more i heard nothing from pickeringsomewhat to my surprise and as the days went by not a little to my discomposure  i had expected that his bliss would continue to overflow in brief bulletins and his silence was possibly an indication that it had been clouded  at last i wrote to his hotel at wiesbaden but received no answer whereupon as my next resource i repaired to his former lodging at homburg where i thought it possible he had left property which he would sooner or later send for  there i learned that he had indeed just telegraphed from cologne for his luggage  to cologne i immediately despatched a line of inquiry as to his prosperity and the cause of his silence  the next day i received three words in answera simple uncommented request that i would come to him  i lost no time and reached him in the course of a few hours  it was dark when i arrived and the city was sheeted in a cold autumnal rain  pickering had stumbled with an indifference which was itself a symptom of distress on a certain musty old mainzerhof and i found him sitting over a smouldering fire in a vast dingy chamber which looked as if it had grown gray with watching the ennui of ten generations of travellers  looking at him as he rose on my entrance i saw that he was in extreme tribulation  he was pale and haggard his face was five years older now at least in all conscience he had tasted of the cup of life  i was anxious to know what had turned it so suddenly to bitterness but i spared him all importunate curiosity and let him take his time  i accepted tacitly his tacit confession of distress and we made for a while a feeble effort to discuss the picturesqueness of cologne  at last he rose and stood a long time looking into the fire while i slowly paced the length of the dusky room  well he said as i came back i wanted knowledge and i certainly know something i didnt a month ago  and herewith calmly and succinctly enough as if dismay had worn itself out he related the history of the foregoing days  he touched lightly on details he evidently never was to gush as freely again as he had done during the prosperity of his suit  he had been accepted one evening as explicitly as his imagination could desire and had gone forth in his rapture and roamed about till nearly morning in the gardens of the conversationhouse taking the stars and the perfumes of the summer night into his confidence  it is worth it all almost he said to have been wound up for an hour to that celestial pitch  no man i am sure can ever know it but once  the next morning he had repaired to madame blumenthals lodging and had been met to his amazement by a naked refusal to see him  he had strode about for a couple of hoursin another moodand then had returned to the charge  the servant handed him a threecornered note it contained these words leave me alone to day i will give you ten minutes tomorrow evening  of the next thirty six hours he could give no coherent account but at the appointed time madame blumenthal had received him  almost before she spoke there had come to him a sense of the depth of his folly in supposing he knew her one has heard all ones days he said of people removing the mask its one of the stock phrases of romance  well there she stood with her mask in her hand  her face he went on gravely after a pauseher face was horrible    i give you ten minutes she had said pointing to the clock  make your scene tear your hair brandish your dagger  and she had sat down and folded her arms  its not a joke she cried its dead earnest let us have it over  you are dismissedhave you nothing to say  he had stammered some frantic demand for an explanation and she had risen and come near him looking at him from head to feet very pale and evidently more excited than she wished him to see  i have done with you she said with a smile you ought to have done with me  it has all been delightful but there are excellent reasons why it should come to an end you have been playing a part then he had gasped out you never cared for me  yes till i knew you till i saw how far you would go  but now the storys finished we have reached the denoument  we will close the book and be good friends  to see how far i would go he had repeated  you led me on meaning all the while to do this  i led you on if you will  i received your visits in season and out  sometimes they were very entertaining sometimes they bored me fearfully  but you were such a very curious case ofwhat shall i call itof sincerity that i determined to take good and bad together  i wanted to make you commit yourself unmistakably  i should have preferred not to bring you to this place but that too was necessary  of course i cant marry you i can do better  so can you for that matter thank your fate for it  you have thought wonders of me for a month but your goodhumour wouldnt last  i am too old and too wise you are too young and too foolish  it seems to me that i have been very good to you i have entertained you to the top of your bent and except perhaps that i am a little brusque just now you have nothing to complain of  i would have let you down more gently if i could have taken another month to it but circumstances have forced my hand  abuse me curse me if you like  i will make every allowance pickering listened to all this intently enough to perceive that as if by some sudden natural cataclysm the ground had broken away at his feet and that he must recoil  he turned away in dumb amazement  i dont know how i seemed to be taking it he said but she seemed really to desirei dont know whysomething in the way of reproach and vituperation  but i couldnt in that way have uttered a syllable  i was sickened i wanted to get away into the airto shake her off and come to my senses  have you nothing nothing nothing to say she cried as if she were disappointed while i stood with my hand on the door  havent i treated you to talk enough i believed i answered you will write to me then when you get home  i think not said i six months hence i fancy you will come and see me  never said i thats a confession of stupidity she answered  it means that even on reflection you will never understand the philosophy of my conduct the word philosophy seemed so strange that i verily believe i smiled i have given you all that you gave me she went on  your passion was an affair of the head  i only wish you had told me sooner that you considered it so i exclaimed  and i went my way  the next day i came down the rhine  i sat all day on the boat not knowing where i was going where to get off  i was in a kind of ague of terror it seemed to me i had seen something infernal  at last i saw the cathedral towers here looming over the city  they seemed to say something to me and when the boat stopped i came ashore  i have been here a week  i have not slept at nightand yet it has been a week of rest  it seemed to me that he was in a fair way to recover and that his own philosophy if left to take its time was adequate to the occasion  after his story was once told i referred to his grievance but oncethat evening later as we were about to separate for the night  suffer me to say that there was some truth in her account of your relations i said  you were using her intellectually and all the while without your knowing it she was using you  it was diamond cut diamond  her needs were the more superficial and she got tired of the game first  he frowned and turned uneasily away but without contradicting me  i waited a few moments to see if he would remember before we parted that he had a claim to make upon me  but he seemed to have forgotten it  the next day we strolled about the picturesque old city and of course before long went into the cathedral  pickering said little he seemed intent upon his own thoughts  he sat down beside a pillar near a chapel in front of a gorgeous window and leaving him to his meditations i wandered through the church  when i came back i saw he had something to say  but before he had spoken i laid my hand on his shoulder and looked at him with a significant smile  he slowly bent his head and dropped his eyes with a mixture of assent and humility  i drew forth from where it had lain untouched for a month the letter he had given me to keep placed it silently on his knee and left him to deal with it alone  half an hour later i returned to the same place but he had gone and one of the sacristans hovering about and seeing me looking for pickering said he thought he had left the church  i found him in his gloomy chamber at the inn pacing slowly up and down  i should doubtless have been at a loss to say just what effect i expected the letter from smyrna to produce but his actual aspect surprised me  he was flushed excited a trifle irritated  evidently i said you have read your letter  it is proper i should tell you what is in it he answered  when i gave it to you a month ago i did my friends injustice  you called it a summons i remember  i was a great fool  its a release  from your engagement  from everything  the letter of course is from mr vernor  he desires to let me know at the earliest moment that his daughter informed for the first time a week before of what had been expected of her positively refuses to be bound by the contract or to assent to my being bound  she had been given a week to reflect and had spent it in inconsolable tears she had resisted every form of persuasion from compulsion writes mr vernor he naturally shrinks  the young lady considers the arrangement horrible  after accepting her duties cut and dried all her life she pretends at last to have a taste of her own  i confess i am surprised i had been given to believe that she was stupidly submissive and would remain so to the end of the chapter  not a bit of it  she has insisted on my being formally dismissed and her father intimates that in case of noncompliance she threatens him with an attack of brain fever  mr vernor condoles with me handsomely and lets me know that the young ladys attitude has been a great shock to his nerves  he adds that he will not aggravate such regret as i may do him the honour to entertain by any allusions to his daughters charms and to the magnitude of my loss and he concludes with the hope that for the comfort of all concerned i may already have amused my fancy with other views  he reminds me in a postscript that in spite of this painful occurrence the son of his most valued friend will always be a welcome visitor at his house  i am free he observes i have my life before me he recommends an extensive course of travel  should my wanderings lead me to the east he hopes that no false embarrassment will deter me from presenting myself at smyrna  he can promise me at least a friendly reception  its a very polite letter  polite as the letter was pickering seemed to find no great exhilaration in having this famous burden so handsomely lifted from his spirit  he began to brood over his liberation in a manner which you might have deemed proper to a renewed sense of bondage  bad news he had called his letter originally and yet now that its contents proved to be in flat contradiction to his foreboding there was no impulsive voice to reverse the formula and declare the news was good  the wings of impulse in the poor fellow had of late been terribly clipped  it was an obvious reflection of course that if he had not been so stiffly certain of the matter a month before and had gone through the form of breaking mr vernors seal he might have escaped the purgatory of madame blumenthals subacid blandishments  but i left him to moralise in private i had no desire as the phrase is to rub it in  my thoughts moreover were following another train i was saying to myself that if to those gentle graces of which her young visage had offered to my fancy the blooming promise miss vernor added in this striking measure the capacity for magnanimous action the amendment to my friends career had been less happy than the rough draught  presently turning about i saw him looking at the young ladys photograph  of course now he said i have no right to keep it  and before i could ask for another glimpse of it he had thrust it into the fire  i am sorry to be saying it just now i observed after a while but i shouldnt wonder if miss vernor were a charming creature  go and find out he answered gloomily  the coast is clear  my part is to forget her he presently added  it ought not to be hard  but dont you think he went on suddenly that for a poor fellow who asked nothing of fortune but leave to sit down in a quiet corner it has been rather a cruel pushing about  cruel indeed i declared and he certainly had the right to demand a clean page on the book of fate and a fresh start  mr vernors advice was sound he should amuse himself with a long journey  if it would be any comfort to him i would go with him on his way  pickering assented without enthusiasm he had the embarrassed look of a man who having gone to some cost to make a good appearance in a drawingroom should find the door suddenly slammed in his face  we started on our journey however and little by little his enthusiasm returned  he was too capable of enjoying fine things to remain permanently irresponsive and after a fortnight spent among pictures and monuments and antiquities i felt that i was seeing him for the first time in his best and healthiest mood  he had had a fever and then he had had a chill the pendulum had swung right and left in a manner rather trying to the machine but now at last it was working back to an even natural beat  he recovered in a measure the generous eloquence with which he had fanned his flame at homburg and talked about things with something of the same passionate freshness  one day when i was laid up at the inn at bruges with a lame foot he came home and treated me to a rhapsody about a certain meekfaced virgin of hans memling which seemed to me sounder sense than his compliments to madame blumenthal  he had his dull days and his sombre moodshours of irresistible retrospect but i let them come and go without remonstrance because i fancied they always left him a trifle more alert and resolute  one evening however he sat hanging his head in so doleful a fashion that i took the bull by the horns and told him he had by this time surely paid his debt to penitence and that he owed it to himself to banish that woman for ever from his thoughts  he looked up staring and then with a deep blushthat woman he said i was not thinking of madame blumenthal  after this i gave another construction to his melancholy  taking him with his hopes and fears at the end of six weeks of active observation and keen sensation pickering was as fine a fellow as need be  we made our way down to italy and spent a fortnight at venice  there something happened which i had been confidently expecting i had said to myself that it was merely a question of time  we had passed the day at torcello and came floating back in the glow of the sunset with measured oarstrokes  i am well on the way pickering said i think i will go  we had not spoken for an hour and i naturally asked him where  his answer was delayed by our getting into the piazzetta  i stepped ashore first and then turned to help him  as he took my hand he met my eyes consciously and it came  to smyrna  a couple of days later he started  i had risked the conjecture that miss vernor was a charming creature and six months afterwards he wrote me that i was right
