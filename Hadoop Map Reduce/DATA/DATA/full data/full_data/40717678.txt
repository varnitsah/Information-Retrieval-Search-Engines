40717678	on the reception of the origin of species   by  professor thomas henry huxley    from the life and letters of charles darwin  edited by francis darwin    on the reception of the origin of species  to the present generation that is to say the people a few years on the hither and thither side of thirty the name of charles darwin stands alongside of those of isaac newton and michael faraday and like them calls up the grand ideal of a searcher after truth and interpreter of nature  they think of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius industry and unswerving veracity who earned his place among the most famous men of the age by sheer native power in the teeth of a gale of popular prejudice and uncheered by a sign of favour or appreciation from the official fountains of honour as one who in spite of an acute sensitiveness to praise and blame and notwithstanding provocations which might have excused any outbreak kept himself clear of all envy hatred and malice nor dealt otherwise than fairly and justly with the unfairness and injustice which was showered upon him while to the end of his days he was ready to listen with patience and respect to the most insignificant of reasonable objectors  and with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of life peopling our globe with which darwins name is bound up as closely as that of newton with the theory of gravitation nothing seems to be further from the mind of the present generation than any attempt to smother it with ridicule or to crush it by vehemence of denunciation the struggle for existence and natural selection have become household words and everyday conceptions  the reality and the importance of the natural processes on which darwin founds his deductions are no more doubted than those of growth and multiplication and whether the full potency attributed to them is admitted or not no one doubts their vast and farreaching significance  wherever the biological sciences are studied the origin of species lights the paths of the investigator wherever they are taught it permeates the course of instruction  nor has the influence of darwinian ideas been less profound beyond the realms of biology the oldest of all philosophies that of evolution was bound hand and foot and cast into utter darkness during the millennium of theological scholasticism  but darwin poured new lifeblood into the ancient frame the bonds burst and the revivified thought of ancient greece has proved itself to be a more adequate expression of the universal order of things than any of the schemes which have been accepted by the credulity and welcomed by the superstition of seventy later generations of men  to any one who studies the signs of the times the emergence of the philosophy of evolution in the attitude of claimant to the throne of the world of thought from the limbo of hated and as many hoped forgotten things is the most portentous event of the nineteenth century  but the most effective weapons of the modern champions of evolution were fabricated by darwin and the origin of species has enlisted a formidable body of combatants trained in the severe school of physical science whose ears might have long remained deaf to the speculations of a priori philosophers  i do not think any candid or instructed person will deny the truth of that which has just been asserted  he may hate the very name of evolution and may deny its pretensions as vehemently as a jacobite denied those of george the second  but there it isnot only as solidly seated as the hanoverian dynasty but happily independent of parliamentary sanctionand the dullest antagonists have come to see that they have to deal with an adversary whose bones are to be broken by no amount of bad words  even the theologians have almost ceased to pit the plain meaning of genesis against the no less plain meaning of nature  their more candid or more cautious representatives have given up dealing with evolution as if it were a damnable heresy and have taken refuge in one of two courses  either they deny that genesis was meant to teach scientific truth and thus save the veracity of the record at the expense of its authority or they expend their energies in devising the cruel ingenuities of the reconciler and torture texts in the vain hope of making them confess the creed of science  but when the peine forte et dure is over the antique sincerity of the venerable sufferer always reasserts itself  genesis is honest to the core and professes to be no more than it is a repository of venerable traditions of unknown origin claiming no scientific authority and possessing none  as my pen finishes these passages i can but be amused to think what a terrible hubbub would have been made in truth was made about any similar expressions of opinion a quarter of a century ago  in fact the contrast between the present condition of public opinion upon the darwinian question between the estimation in which darwins views are now held in the scientific world between the acquiescence or at least quiescence of the theologians of the selfrespecting order at the present day and the outburst of antagonism on all sides in 18589 when the new theory respecting the origin of species first became known to the older generation to which i belong is so startling that except for documentary evidence i should be sometimes inclined to think my memories dreams  i have a great respect for the younger generation myself they can write our lives and ravel out all our follies if they choose to take the trouble by and by and i should be glad to be assured that the feeling is reciprocal but i am afraid that the story of our dealings with darwin may prove a great hindrance to that veneration for our wisdom which i should like them to display  we have not even the excuse that thirty years ago mr darwin was an obscure novice who had no claims on our attention  on the contrary his remarkable zoological and geological investigations had long given him an assured position among the most eminent and original investigators of the day while his charming voyage of a naturalist had justly earned him a widespread reputation among the general public  i doubt if there was any man then living who had a better right to expect that anything he might choose to say on such a question as the origin of species would be listened to with profound attention and discussed with respect and there was certainly no man whose personal character should have afforded a better safeguard against attacks instinct with malignity and spiced with shameless impertinences  yet such was the portion of one of the kindest and truest men that it was ever my good fortune to know and years had to pass away before misrepresentation ridicule and denunciation ceased to be the most notable constituents of the majority of the multitudinous criticisms of his work which poured from the press i am loth to rake any of these ancient scandals from their welldeserved oblivion but i must make good a statement which may seem overcharged to the present generation and there is no piece justificative more apt for the purpose or more worthy of such dishonour than the article in the quarterly review for july 1860  i was not aware when i wrote these passages that the authorship of the article had been publicly acknowledged confession unaccompanied by penitence however affords no ground for mitigation of judgment and the kindliness with which mr darwin speaks of his assailant bishop wilberforce vol ii is so striking an exemplification of his singular gentleness and modesty that it rather increases ones indignation against the presumption of his critic since lord brougham assailed dr young the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow pretender to a master in science as this remarkable production in which one of the most exact of observers most cautious of reasoners and most candid of expositors of this or any other age is held up to scorn as a flighty person who endeavours to prop up his utterly rotten fabric of guess and speculation and whose mode of dealing with nature is reprobated as utterly dishonourable to natural science  and all this high and mighty talk which would have been indecent in one of mr darwins equals proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence or of conscience or of both is so great that by way of an objection to mr darwins views he can ask is it credible that all favourable varieties of turnips are tending to become men who is so ignorant of paleontology that he can talk of the flowers and fruits of the plants of the carboniferous epoch of comparative anatomy that he can gravely affirm the poison apparatus of the venomous snakes to be entirely separate from the ordinary laws of animal life and peculiar to themselves of the rudiments of physiology that he can ask what advantage of life could alter the shape of the corpuscles into which the blood can be evaporated  nor does the reviewer fail to flavour this outpouring of preposterous incapacity with a little stimulation of the odium theologicum  some inkling of the history of the conflicts between astronomy geology and theology leads him to keep a retreat open by the proviso that he cannot consent to test the truth of natural science by the word of revelation but for all that he devotes pages to the exposition of his conviction that mr darwins theory contradicts the revealed relation of the creation to its creator and is inconsistent with the fulness of his glory  if i confine my retrospect of the reception of the origin of species to a twelvemonth or thereabouts from the time of its publication i do not recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the quarterly review article unless perhaps the address of a reverend professor to the dublin geological society might enter into competition with it  but a large proportion of mr darwins critics had a lamentable resemblance to the quarterly reviewer in so far as they lacked either the will or the wit to make themselves masters of his doctrine hardly any possessed the knowledge required to follow him through the immense range of biological and geological science which the origin covered while too commonly they had prejudiced the case on theological grounds and as seems to be inevitable when this happens eked out lack of reason by superfluity of railing  but it will be more pleasant and more profitable to consider those criticisms which were acknowledged by writers of scientific authority or which bore internal evidence of the greater or less competency and often of the good faith of their authors  restricting my survey to a twelvemonth or thereabouts after the publication of the origin i find among such critics louis agassiz the arguments presented by darwin in favor of a universal derivation from one primary form of all the peculiarities existing now among living beings have not made the slightest impression on my mind  until the facts of nature are shown to have been mistaken by those who have collected them and that they have a different meaning from that now generally assigned to them i shall therefore consider the transmutation theory as a scientific mistake untrue in its facts unscientific in its method and mischievous in its tendencysillimans

as pallas athene may have looked at dian after the endymion affair declared himself a darwinian though not without putting in a serious caveat  nevertheless he was a tower of strength and his courageous stand for truth as against consistency did him infinite honour  as evolutionists sans phrase i do not call to mind among the biologists more than asa gray who fought the battle splendidly in the united states hooker who was no less vigorous here the present sir john lubbock and myself  wallace was far away in the malay archipelago but apart from his direct share in the promulgation of the theory of natural selection no enumeration of the influences at work at the time i am speaking of would be complete without the mention of his powerful essay on the law which has regulated the introduction of new species which was published in 1855  on reading it afresh i have been astonished to recollect how small was the impression it made  in france the influence of elie de beaumont and of flourensthe former of whom is said to have damned himself to everlasting fame by inventing the nickname of la science moussante for evolutionism one is reminded of the effect of another small academic epigram  the socalled vertebral theory of the skull is said to have been nipped in the bud in france by the whisper of an academician to his neighbour that in that case ones head was a vertebre pensanteto say nothing of the illwill of other powerful members of the institut produced for a long time the effect of a conspiracy of silence and many years passed before the academy redeemed itself from the reproach that the name of darwin was not to be found on the list of its members however an accomplished writer out of the range of academical influences m laugel gave an excellent and appreciative notice of the origin in the revue des deux mondes  germany took time to consider bronn produced a slightly bowdlerized translation of the origin and kladderadatsch cut his jokes upon the ape origin of man but i do not call to mind that any scientific notability declared himself publicly in 1860 however the man who stands next to darwin in his influence on modern biologists ke von baer wrote to me in august 1860 expressing his general assent to evolutionist views  his phrase jai enonce les memes ideesque m darwin volume ii is shown by his subsequent writings to mean no more than this none of us dreamed that in the course of a few years the strength and perhaps i may add the weakness of darwinismus would have its most extensive and most brilliant illustrations in the land of learning  if a foreigner may presume to speculate on the cause of this curious interval of silence i fancy it was that one moiety of the german biologists were orthodox at any price and the other moiety as distinctly heterodox  the latter were evolutionists a priori already and they must have felt the disgust natural to deductive philosophers at being offered an inductive and experimental foundation for a conviction which they had reached by a shorter cut  it is undoubtedly trying to learn that though your conclusions may be all right your reasons for them are all wrong or at any rate insufficient  on the whole then the supporters of mr darwins views in 1860 were numerically extremely insignificant  there is not the slightest doubt that if a general council of the church scientific had been held at that time we should have been condemned by an overwhelming majority and there is as little doubt that if such a council gathered now the decree would be of an exactly contrary nature  it would indicate a lack of sense as well as of modesty to ascribe to the men of that generation less capacity or less honesty than their successors possess what then are the causes which led instructed and fairjudging men of that day to arrive at a judgment so different from that which seems just and fair to those who follow them that is really one of the most interesting of all questions connected with the history of science and i shall try to answer it  i am afraid that in order to do so i must run the risk of appearing egotistical  however if i tell my own story it is only because i know it better than that of other people  i think i must have read the vestiges before i left england in 1846 but if i did the book made very little impression upon me and i was not brought into serious contact with the species question until after 1850  at that time i had long done with the pentateuchal cosmogony which had been impressed upon my childish understanding as divine truth with all the authority of parents and instructors and from which it had cost me many a struggle to get free  but my mind was unbiassed in respect of any doctrine which presented itself if it professed to be based on purely philosophical and scientific reasoning it seemed to me then as it does now that creation in the ordinary sense of the word is perfectly conceivable  i find no difficulty in imagining that at some former period this universe was not in existence and that it made its appearance in six days or instantaneously if that is preferred in consequence of the volition of some preexistent being  then as now the socalled a priori arguments against theism and given a deity against the possibility of creative acts appeared to me to be devoid of reasonable foundation i had not then and i have not now the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the creation of animals and plants given in paradise lost in which milton so vividly embodies the natural sense of genesis  far be it from me to say that it is untrue because it is impossible  i confine myself to what must be regarded as a modest and reasonable request for some particle of evidence that the existing species of animals and plants did originate in that way as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears to me to be highly improbable  and by way of being perfectly fair i had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 18518  within the ranks of the biologists at that time i met with nobody except dr grant of university college who had a word to say for evolutionand his advocacy was not calculated to advance the cause  outside these ranks the only person known to me whose knowledge and capacity compelled respect and who was at the same time a thoroughgoing evolutionist was mr herbert spencer whose acquaintance i made i think in 1852 and then entered into the bonds of a friendship which i am happy to think has known no interruption  many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic  but even my friends rare dialectic skill and copiousness of apt illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position  i took my stand upon two grounds  firstly that up to that time the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly insufficient and secondly that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed which had been made was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena  looking back at the state of knowledge at that time i really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable  in those days i had never even heard of treviranus biologie however i had studied lamarck attentively and i had read the vestiges with due care but neither of them afforded me any good ground for changing my negative and critical attitude  as for the vestiges i confess that the book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance and thoroughly unscientific habit of mind manifested by the writer  if it had any influence on me at all it set me against evolution and the only review i ever have qualms of conscience about on the ground of needless savagery is one i wrote on the vestiges while under that influence  with respect to the philosophie zoologique it is no reproach to lamarck to say that the discussion of the species question in that work whatever might be said for it in 1809 was miserably below the level of the knowledge of half a century later  in that interval of time the elucidation of the structure of the lower animals and plants had given rise to wholly new conceptions of their relations histology and embryology in the modern sense had been created physiology had been reconstituted the facts of distribution geological and geographical had been prodigiously multiplied and reduced to order to any biologist whose studies had carried him beyond mere speciesmongering in 1850 onehalf of lamarcks arguments were obsolete and the other half erroneous or defective in virtue of omitting to deal with the various classes of evidence which had been brought to light since his time  moreover his one suggestion as to the cause of the gradual modification of specieseffort excited by change of conditionswas on the face of it inapplicable to the whole vegetable world  i do not think that any impartial judge who reads the philosophie zoologique now and who afterwards takes up lyells trenchant and effectual criticism published as far back as 1830 will be disposed to allot to lamarck a much higher place in the establishment of biological evolution than that which bacon assigns to himself in relation to physical science generallybuccinator tantum erasmus darwin first promulgated lamarcks fundamental conceptions and with greater logical consistency he had applied them to plants but the advocates of his claims have failed to show that he in any respect anticipated the central idea of the origin of species  but by a curious irony of fate the same influence which led me to put as little faith in modern speculations on this subject as in the venerable traditions recorded in the first two chapters of genesis was perhaps more potent than any other in keeping alive a sort of pious conviction that evolution after all would turn out true  i have recently read afresh the first edition of the principles of geology and when i consider that this remarkable book had been nearly thirty years in everybodys hands and that it brings home to any reader of ordinary intelligence a great principle and a great factthe principle that the past must be explained by the present unless good cause be shown to the contrary and the fact that so far as our knowledge of the past history of life on our globe goes no such cause can be shown the same principle and the same fact guide the result from all sound historical investigation  grotes history of greece is a product of the same intellectual movement as lyells principlesi cannot but believe that lyell for others as for myself was the chief agent for smoothing the road for darwin  for consistent uniformitarianism postulates evolution as much in the organic as in the inorganic world  the origin of a new species by other than ordinary agencies would be a vastly greater catastrophe than any of those which lyell successfully eliminated from sober geological speculation  in fact no one was better aware of this than lyell himself lyell with perfect right claims this position for himself  he speaks of having advocated a law of continuity even in the organic world so far as possible without adopting lamarcks theory of transmutation  but while i taught that as often as certain forms of animals and plants disappeared for reasons quite intelligible to us others took their place by virtue of a causation which was beyond our comprehension it remained for darwin to accumulate proof that there is no break between the incoming and the outgoing species that they are the work of evolution and not of special creation  i had certainly prepared the way in this country in six editions of my work before the vestiges of creation appeared in 1842 1844 for the reception of darwins gradual and insensible evolution of specieslife and letters letter to haeckel volume ii page 436 november 23 1868  if one reads any of the earlier editions of the principles carefully especially by the light of the interesting series of letters recently published by sir charles lyells biographer it is easy to see that with all his energetic opposition to lamarck on the one hand and to the ideal quasiprogressionism of agassiz on the other lyell in his own mind was strongly disposed to account for the origination of all past and present species of living things by natural causes  but he would have liked at the same time to keep the name of creation for a natural process which he imagined to be incomprehensible  in a letter addressed to mantell dated march 2 1827 lyell speaks of having just read lamarck he expresses his delight at lamarcks theories and his personal freedom from any objection based on theological grounds  and though he is evidently alarmed at the pithecoid origin of man involved in lamarcks doctrine he observes  but after all what changes species may really undergo  how impossible will it be to distinguish and lay down a line beyond which some of the socalled extinct species have never passed into recent ones  again the following remarkable passage occurs in the postscript of a letter addressed to sir john herschel in 1836  in regard to the origination of new species i am very glad to find that you think it probable that it may be carried on through the intervention of intermediate causes  i left this rather to be inferred not thinking it worth while to offend a certain class of persons by embodying in words what would only be a speculation  in the same sense see the letter to whewell march 7 1837 volume ii page 5  in regard to this last subject the changes from one set of animal and vegetable species to anotheryou remember what herschel said in his letter to me  if i had stated as plainly as he has done the possibility of the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process i should have raised a host of prejudices against me which are unfortunately opposed at every step to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these mysterious subjects  see also letter to sedgwick january 12 1838 ii page 35  he goes on to refer to the criticisms which have been directed against him on the ground that by leaving species to be originated by miracle he is inconsistent with his own doctrine of uniformitarianism and he leaves it to be understood that he had not replied on the ground of his general objection to controversy  lyells contemporaries were not without some inkling of his esoteric doctrine  whewells history of the inductive sciences whatever its philosophical value is always worth reading and always interesting if under no other aspect than that of an evidence of the speculative limits within which a highlyplaced divine might at that time safely range at will in the course of his discussion of uniformitarianism the encyclopaedic master of trinity observes  mr lyell indeed has spoken of an hypothesis that the successive creation of species may constitute a regular part of the economy of nature but he has nowhere i think so described this process as to make it appear in what department of science we are to place the hypothesis  are these new species created by the production at long intervals of an offspring different in species from the parents  or are the species so created produced without parents  are they gradually evolved from some embryo substance  or do they suddenly start from the ground as in the creation of the poet  some selection of one of these forms of the hypothesis rather than the others with evidence for the selection is requisite to entitle us to place it among the known causes of change which in this chapter we are considering  the bare conviction that a creation of species has taken place whether once or many times so long as it is unconnected with our organical sciences is a tenet of natural theology rather than of physical philosophy whewells history volume iii page 639640 edition 2 1847  the earlier part of this criticism appears perfectly just and appropriate but from the concluding paragraph whewell evidently imagines that by creation lyell means a preternatural intervention of the deity whereas the letter to herschel shows that in his own mind lyell meant natural causation and i see no reason to doubt the following passages in lyells letters appear to me decisive on this point  to darwin october 3 1859 ii 325 on first reading the origin  i have long seen most clearly that if any concession is made all that you claim in your concluding pages will follow  it is this which has made me so long hesitate always feeling that the case of man and his races and of other animals and that of plants is one and the same and that if a vera causa be admitted for one instant instead of a purely unknown and imaginary one such as the word creation all the consequences must follow  to darwin march 15 1863 volume ii page 365  i remember that it was the conclusion he lamarck came to about man that fortified me thirty years ago against the great impression which his arguments at first made on my mind all the greater because constant prevost a pupil of cuviers forty years ago told me his conviction that cuvier thought species not real but that science could not advance without assuming that they were so  to hooker march 9 1863 volume ii page 361 in reference to darwins feeling about the antiquity of man  he darwin seems much disappointed that i do not go farther with him or do not speak out more  i can only say that i have spoken out to the full extent of my present convictions and even beyond my state of feeling as to mans unbroken descent from the brutes and i find i am half converting not a few who were in arms against darwin and are even now against huxley  he speaks of having had to abandon old and long cherished ideas which constituted the charm to me of the theoretical part of the science in my earlier day when i believed with pascal in the theory as hallam terms it of the archangel ruined  see the same sentiment in the letter to darwin march 11 1863 page 363  i think the old creation is almost as much required as ever but of course it takes a new form if lamarcks views improved by yours are adopted that if sir charles could have avoided the inevitable corollary of the pithecoid origin of manfor which to the end of his life he entertained a profound antipathyhe would have advocated the efficiency of causes now in operation to bring about the condition of the organic world as stoutly as he championed that doctrine in reference to inorganic nature  the fact is that a discerning eye might have seen that some form or other of the doctrine of transmutation was inevitable from the time when the truth enunciated by william smith that successive strata are characterised by different kinds of fossil remains became a firmly established law of nature  no one has set forth the speculative consequences of this generalisation better than the historian of the inductive sciences  but the study of geology opens to us the spectacle of many groups of species which have in the course of the earths history succeeded each other at vast intervals of time one set of animals and plants disappearing as it would seem from the face of our planet and others which did not before exist becoming the only occupants of the globe  and the dilemma then presents itself to us aneweither we must accept the doctrine of the transmutation of species and must suppose that the organized species of one geological epoch were transmuted into those of another by some longcontinued agency of natural causes or else we must believe in many successive acts of creation and extinction of species out of the common course of nature acts which therefore we may properly call miraculous  whewells history of the inductive sciences  edition ii 1847 volume iii pages 624625  see for the authors verdict pages 63839  dr whewell decides in favour of the latter conclusion  and if any one had plied him with the four questions which he puts to lyell in the passage already cited all that can be said now is that he would certainly have rejected the first  but would he really have had the courage to say that a rhinoceros tichorhinus for instance was produced without parents or was evolved from some embryo substance or that it suddenly started from the ground like miltons lion pawing to get free his hinder parts i permit myself to doubt whether even the master of trinitys welltried couragephysical intellectual and moralwould have been equal to this feat  no doubt the sudden concurrence of halfaton of inorganic molecules into a live rhinoceros is conceivable and therefore may be possible  but does such an event lie sufficiently within the bounds of probability to justify the belief in its occurrence on the strength of any attainable or indeed imaginable evidence  in view of the assertion often repeated in the early days of the opposition to darwin that he had added nothing to lamarck it is very interesting to observe that the possibility of a fifth alternative in addition to the four he has stated has not dawned upon dr whewells mind  the suggestion that new species may result from the selective action of external conditions upon the variations from their specific type which individuals presentand which we call spontaneous because we are ignorant of their causationis as wholly unknown to the historian of scientific ideas as it was to biological specialists before 1858 but that suggestion is the central idea of the origin of species and contains the quintessence of darwinism  thus looking back into the past it seems to me that my own position of critical expectancy was just and reasonable and must have been taken up on the same grounds by many other persons if agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the deity and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as his ideas took a more advanced shape i found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded but i had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them  and besides that i could by no means see what the explanation explained  neither did it help me to be told by an eminent anatomist that species had succeeded one another in time in virtue of a continuously operative creational law  that seemed to me to be no more than saying that species had succeeded one another in the form of a votecatching resolution with law to please the man of science and creational to draw the orthodox  so i took refuge in that thatige skepsis which goethe has so well defined and reversing the apostolic precept to be all things to all men i usually defended the tenability of the received doctrines when i had to do with the transmutationists and stood up for the possibility of transmutation among the orthodoxthereby no doubt increasing an already current but quite undeserved reputation for needless combativeness  i remember in the course of my first interview with mr darwin expressing my belief in the sharpness of the lines of demarcation between natural groups and in the absence of transitional forms with all the confidence of youth and imperfect knowledge  i was not aware at that time that he had then been many years brooding over the speciesquestion and the humorous smile which accompanied his gentle answer that such was not altogether his view long haunted and puzzled me  but it would seem that four or five years hard work had enabled me to understand what it meant for lyell life and letters volume ii page 212 writing to sir charles bunbury under date of april 30 1856 says  when huxley hooker and wollaston were at darwins last week they all four of them ran a tilt against speciesfurther i believe than they are prepared to go  i recollect nothing of this beyond the fact of meeting mr wollaston and except for sir charles distinct assurance as to all four i should have thought my outrecuidance was probably a counterblast to wollastons conservatism  with regard to hooker he was already like voltaires habbakuk capable du tout in the way of advocating evolution  as i have already said i imagine that most of those of my contemporaries who thought seriously about the matter were very much in my own state of mindinclined to say to both mosaists and evolutionists a plague on both your houses and disposed to turn aside from an interminable and apparently fruitless discussion to labour in the fertile fields of ascertainable fact  and i may therefore further suppose that the publication of the darwin and wallace papers in 1858 and still more that of the origin in 1859 had the effect upon them of the flash of light which to a man who has lost himself in a dark night suddenly reveals a road which whether it takes him straight home or not certainly goes his way  that which we were looking for and could not find was a hypothesis respecting the origin of known organic forms which assumed the operation of no causes but such as could be proved to be actually at work  we wanted not to pin our faith to that or any other speculation but to get hold of clear and definite conceptions which could be brought face to face with facts and have their validity tested  the origin provided us with the working hypothesis we sought moreover it did the immense service of freeing us for ever from the dilemmarefuse to accept the creation hypothesis and what have you to propose that can be accepted by any cautious reasoner  in 1857 i had no answer ready and i do not think that any one else had  a year later we reproached ourselves with dullness for being perplexed by such an inquiry  my reflection when i first made myself master of the central idea of the origin was how extremely stupid not to have thought of that  i suppose that columbus companions said much the same when he made the egg stand on end  the facts of variability of the struggle for existence of adaptation to conditions were notorious enough but none of us had suspected that the road to the heart of the species problem lay through them until darwin and wallace dispelled the darkness and the beaconfire of the origin guided the benighted  whether the particular shape which the doctrine of evolution as applied to the organic world took in darwins hands would prove to be final or not was to me a matter of indifference  in my earliest criticisms of the origin i ventured to point out that its logical foundation was insecure so long as experiments in selective breeding had not produced varieties which were more or less infertile and that insecurity remains up to the present time  but with any and every critical doubt which my sceptical ingenuity could suggest the darwinian hypothesis remained incomparably more probable than the creation hypothesis  and if we had none of us been able to discern the paramount significance of some of the most patent and notorious of natural facts until they were so to speak thrust under our noses what force remained in the dilemmacreation or nothing  it was obvious that hereafter the probability would be immensely greater that the links of natural causation were hidden from our purblind eyes than that natural causation should be incompetent to produce all the phenomena of nature  the only rational course for those who had no other object than the attainment of truth was to accept darwinism as a working hypothesis and see what could be made of it  either it would prove its capacity to elucidate the facts of organic life or it would break down under the strain  this was surely the dictate of common sense and for once common sense carried the day  the result has been that complete volteface of the whole scientific world which must seem so surprising to the present generation  i do not mean to say that all the leaders of biological science have avowed themselves darwinians but i do not think that there is a single zoologist or botanist or palaeontologist among the multitude of active workers of this generation who is other than an evolutionist profoundly influenced by darwins views  whatever may be the ultimate fate of the particular theory put forth by darwin i venture to affirm that so far as my knowledge goes all the ingenuity and all the learning of hostile critics have not enabled them to adduce a solitary fact of which it can be said this is irreconcilable with the darwinian theory  in the prodigious variety and complexity of organic nature there are multitudes of phenomena which are not deducible from any generalisations we have yet reached  but the same may be said of every other class of natural objects  i believe that astronomers cannot yet get the moons motions into perfect accordance with the theory of gravitation  it would be inappropriate even if it were possible to discuss the difficulties and unresolved problems which have hitherto met the evolutionist and which will probably continue to puzzle him for generations to come in the course of this brief history of the reception of mr darwins great work  but there are two or three objections of a more general character based or supposed to be based upon philosophical and theological foundations which were loudly expressed in the early days of the darwinian controversy and which though they have been answered over and over again crop up now and then to the present day  the most singular of these perhaps immortal fallacies which live on tithonuslike when sense and force have long deserted them is that which charges mr darwin with having attempted to reinstate the old pagan goddess chance  it is said that he supposes variations to come about by chance and that the fittest survive the chances of the struggle for existence and thus chance is substituted for providential design  it is not a little wonderful that such an accusation as this should be brought against a writer who has over and over again warned his readers that when he uses the word spontaneous he merely means that he is ignorant of the cause of that which is so termed and whose whole theory crumbles to pieces if the uniformity and regularity of natural causation for illimitable past ages is denied  but probably the best answer to those who talk of darwinism meaning the reign of chance is to ask them what they themselves understand by chance  do they believe that anything in this universe happens without reason or without a cause  do they really conceive that any event has no cause and could not have been predicted by any one who had a sufficient insight into the order of nature  if they do it is they who are the inheritors of antique superstition and ignorance and whose minds have never been illumined by a ray of scientific thought the one act of faith in the convert to science is the confession of the universality of order and of the absolute validity in all times and under all circumstances of the law of causation  this confession is an act of faith because by the nature of the case the truth of such propositions is not susceptible of proof but such faith is not blind but reasonable because it is invariably confirmed by experience and constitutes the sole trustworthy foundation for all action  if one of these people in whom the chanceworship of our remoter ancestors thus strangely survives should be within reach of the sea when a heavy gale is blowing let him betake himself to the shore and watch the scene  let him note the infinite variety of form and size of the tossing waves out at sea or of the curves of their foamcrested breakers as they dash against the rocks let him listen to the roar and scream of the shingle as it is cast up and torn down the beach or look at the flakes of foam as they drive hither and thither before the wind or note the play of colours which answers a gleam of sunshine as it falls upon the myriad bubbles  surely here if anywhere he will say that chance is supreme and bend the knee as one who has entered the very penetralia of his divinity  but the man of science knows that here as everywhere perfect order is manifested that there is not a curve of the waves not a note in the howling chorus not a rainbowglint on a bubble which is other than a necessary consequence of the ascertained laws of nature and that with a sufficient knowledge of the conditions competent physicomathematical skill could account for and indeed predict every one of these chance events  a second very common objection to mr darwins views was and is that they abolish teleology and eviscerate the argument from design  it is nearly twenty years since i ventured to offer some remarks on this subject and as my arguments have as yet received no refutation i hope i may be excused for reproducing them  i observed that the doctrine of evolution is the most formidable opponent of all the commoner and coarser forms of teleology  but perhaps the most remarkable service to the philosophy of biology rendered by mr darwin is the reconciliation of teleology and morphology and the explanation of the facts of both which his views offer  the teleology which supposes that the eye such as we see it in man or one of the higher vertebrata was made with the precise structure it exhibits for the purpose of enabling the animal which possesses it to see has undoubtedly received its deathblow nevertheless it is necessary to remember that there is a wider teleology which is not touched by the doctrine of evolution but is actually based upon the fundamental proposition of evolution this proposition is that the whole world living and not living is the result of the mutual interaction according to definite laws of the forces i should now like to substitute the word powers for forces possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of the universe was composed  if this be true it is no less certain that the existing world lay potentially in the cosmic vapour and that a sufficient intelligence could from a knowledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour have predicted say the state of the fauna of britain in 1869 with as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the vapour of the breath on a cold winters day  the teleological and the mechanical views of nature are not necessarily mutually exclusive  on the contrary the more purely a mechanist the speculator is the more firmly does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement of which all the phenomena of the universe are the consequences and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the teleologist who can always defy him to disprove that this primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the phenomena of the universe  the genealogy of animals the academy 1869 reprinted in critiques and addresses  the acute champion of teleology paley saw no difficulty in admitting that the production of things may be the result of trains of mechanical dispositions fixed beforehand by intelligent appointment and kept in action by a power at the centre natural theology chapter xxiii that is to say he proleptically accepted the modern doctrine of evolution and his successors might do well to follow their leader or at any rate to attend to his weighty reasonings before rushing into an antagonism which has no reasonable foundation  having got rid of the belief in chance and the disbelief in design as in no sense appurtenances of evolution the third libel upon that doctrine that it is antitheistic might perhaps be left to shift for itself  but the persistence with which many people refuse to draw the plainest consequences from the propositions they profess to accept renders it advisable to remark that the doctrine of evolution is neither antitheistic nor theistic  it simply has no more to do with theism than the first book of euclid has  it is quite certain that a normal freshlaid egg contains neither cock nor hen and it is also as certain as any proposition in physics or morals that if such an egg is kept under proper conditions for three weeks a cock or hen chicken will be found in it  it is also quite certain that if the shell were transparent we should be able to watch the formation of the young fowl day by day by a process of evolution from a microscopic cellular germ to its full size and complication of structure  therefore evolution in the strictest sense is actually going on in this and analogous millions and millions of instances wherever living creatures exist therefore to borrow an argument from butler as that which now happens must be consistent with the attributes of the deity if such a being exists evolution must be consistent with those attributes  and if so the evolution of the universe which is neither more nor less explicable than that of a chicken must also be consistent with them the doctrine of evolution therefore does not even come into contact with theism considered as a philosophical doctrine  that with which it does collide and with which it is absolutely inconsistent is the conception of creation which theological speculators have based upon the history narrated in the opening of the book of genesis  there is a great deal of talk and not a little lamentation about the socalled religious difficulties which physical science has created in theological science as a matter of fact it has created none  not a solitary problem presents itself to the philosophical theist at the present day which has not existed from the time that philosophers began to think out the logical grounds and the logical consequences of theism  all the real or imaginary perplexities which flow from the conception of the universe as a determinate mechanism are equally involved in the assumption of an eternal omnipotent and omniscient deity  the theological equivalent of the scientific conception of order is providence and the doctrine of determinism follows as surely from the attributes of foreknowledge assumed by the theologian as from the universality of natural causation assumed by the man of science the angels in paradise lost would have found the task of enlightening adam upon the mysteries of fate foreknowledge and freewill not a whit more difficult if their pupil had been educated in a realschule and trained in every laboratory of a modern university in respect of the great problems of philosophy the postdarwinian generation is in one sense exactly where the praedarwinian generations were  they remain insoluble  but the present generation has the advantage of being better provided with the means of freeing itself from the tyranny of certain sham solutions  the known is finite the unknown infinite intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability  our business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land to add something to the extent and the solidity of our possessions  and even a cursory glance at the history of the biological sciences during the last quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion that the most potent instrument for the extension of the realm of natural knowledge which has come into mens hands since the publication of newtons principia is darwins origin of species  it was badly received by the generation to which it was first addressed and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which it gave rise is sad to think upon  but the present generation will probably behave just as badly if another darwin should arise and inflict upon them that which the generality of mankind most hatethe necessity of revising their convictions  let them then be charitable to us ancients and if they behave no better than the men of my day to some new benefactor let them recollect that after all our wrath did not come to much and vented itself chiefly in the bad language of sanctimonious scolds  let them as speedily perform a strategic rightaboutface and follow the truth wherever it leads  the opponents of the new truth will discover as those of darwin are doing that after all theories do not alter facts and that the universe remains unaffected even though texts crumble  or it may be that as history repeats itself their happy ingenuity will also discover that the new wine is exactly of the same vintage as the old and that rightly viewed the old bottles prove to have been expressly made for holding it
