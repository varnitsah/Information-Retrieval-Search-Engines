          copyright 1888 by a l burt     a runaway brig     chapter i  the sally walker   im going down to the beach to find jim libby if youll come along well have a prime sail and most likely this is the last chance we shall have to go out with him for his vessel leaves in the morning  how can i go when ive got to mind this young one all the forenoon just cause the nurse must go an have a sick headache i dont believe she feels half as bad as i do and walter morse looked mournfully out over the blue waters with but little care for his baby sister who was already toddling dangerously near the long flight of steps leading from the veranda of the large summer hotel  cant you coax off for a couple of hours the first speaker harry vandyne asked  its no use mother has gone to ride and said i was to stay here until she came back  harry started toward the beach determined not to lose a single hour of pleasure because of his friends engagements but before he had taken half a dozen steps a sudden and what seemed like a very happy thought occurred to him  ill tell you how it can be fixed hire one of the other nurses to take care of your sister till we get back any of them will do it for a quarter an well be home before your mother comes  the boys were spending the summer at the isle of shoals off the new england coast harrys father was robert vandyne the wellknown shipowner of new york and walters was equally prominent in the wholesale drygoods business on broadway during their stay at this summer resort they had made the acquaintance of jim libby cooks assistant and everybodys mate on the fishingschooner mary walker a craft which visited the shoals once each week to supply the hotels with fresh fish  jim was at liberty to follow the dictates of his own fancy several hours each day while in port and the boys found him ever ready to take them out sailing in the squarebowed leaky tender belonging to the schooner as harry had said this was jims last day on the island until the end of another cruise and walter was so eager to blister his hands and wet his feet once more by rowing the sally walkerthe tender was dignified with a namearound the shore that he really did not stop to consider all harrys advice implied  he wanted to go on the water bessie would have even better care from one of the nurses than he could give her and it was not difficult to convince himself that under all the circumstances he would be warranted in disobeying the positive commands of his mother  she didnt know jim was going away in the morning or im sure shed a fixed it sos i could take one more trip in the sally  of course she wont care harry said in such a decided tone that walter who was more than willing to be convinced by the most flimsy argument made his decision at once  come on theres mrs harveys maid and well ask her  the bribe of twentyfive cents was sufficient to enlist the goodnatured girls sympathies and five minutes later the two boys were running at full speed toward the shore while bessie apparently well content with the change of nurses looked so happy that walter really began to believe he had done the child such a very great favor that his mother could not but be pleased  the unwieldylooking sally walker was drawn up in a little cove which owing to a line of rocks just outside made a most convenient landingplace and on the bow sat master jim his face striped with dirt but beaming with goodnature and his clothes as ragged as they were redolent of fish  id jes begun to think you couldnt come an was goin back he cried as his neatlydressed acquaintances came into view if we wanter do any sailin its time to be off cause this winds dyin out mighty fast  its better late than never jim harry cried cheerily as he commenced to push at the bow of the boat lets get the old craft afloat and do our talking afterward  to launch the sally into deep water was quite a hard task owing to her breadth of beam but after that had been done the labor was ended for a time save such as might be necessary with the bailingdish  jim stepped the short mast with its wellworn legofmutton sail got one of the oars aft as a rudder and the fullbowed clipper began to move through the water slowly but with a splashing and a wake sufficient for a craft ten times her size  we cant run along the coast very well cause the winds blowin straight out to sea an she dont stand up to it like a narrower boat would the skipper said as he settled himself back comfortably in the sternsheets while he pulled the fragment of a straw hat down over his eyes  lets sail before the wind two or three miles and then row back walter suggested id like to get to the hotel before mother comes  itll be a tough pull jim replied as he glanced at the clumsy oars id rather row the sally one mile than two  harry and i will do that part of the work  then let her go and as jim eased off on the sheet the old craft came around slowly for she was by no means prompt in answering the helm  see that ship over there how far away is she harry asked as he pointed seaward when the sally was well under way  that aint a ship jim replied with a slight tone of contempt because his companions were so ignorant shes a brigantine an hard on to three miles from here  lets run over to where she is we can row back by dinnertime easily enough  since his crew were to do all the work on the return trip jim would have been perfectly willing had the distance been twice as far and he gave assent by nodding his head in what he intended should be a truly nautical manner  the brig which was now the objective point of the trip appeared to be a craft of about three hundred tons and moving through the water slowly under the influence of the rapidlydecreasing wind on a course at rightangles with the one the sally was pursuing she was running with yards square under her upper and lower topsails foresail jib and foretopmast staysail and the headsheets were flowing  she aint goin so fast but what we can come up with her before the breeze dies away i reckon an if shes becalmed they wont say anything agin our goin aboard jim said after a few moments of silence during which all hands gazed intently at the stranger  the idea of visiting a vessel at sea was very enticing to the city boys and they were now as eager for a calm as they had previously been to have the wind freshen the sally took in so much water between her halfcalked seams that it was necessary to keep the bailingdish in constant use consequently there was little time for speculation as to where the brig was bound until when they had sailed not more than a mile and a half jim said in a tone of mild disappointment  its no use fellers we cant get there its dead calm an we aint makin a foot an hour  whats to prevent our rowing harry asked you take down the sail and keep the bailing dish going while walter and i show you how to make the sally walk  im willin if you are and jim unshipped the stumpy mast my vessel wont get under way before mornin an it makes no difference if i aint back till sunrise  to make the sally walk required a great deal of hard work but since it was under the guise of play harry and walter went at it with a will while jim wondered what sport boys could find in pulling a heavy boat for this was the one portion of a fishermans life at which he rebelled  slowly but surely the little craft gained upon the larger one which swung to and fro on the lazy swell and when they were about a quarter of a mile apart jim said in a tone of disapprobation  the crew on that brig are worsen fishermen every one of em must be below for i havent seen so much as a fellers nose yet perhaps some of the crew have gone ashorethe gangways unshipped  unacquainted with nautical matters as the city boys were they did not think there was anything strange in such a condition of affairs but kept steadily at work with the oars until jim scrambled into the bow to fend off the journey having been finished  ill make fast here while you go aboard he said as he seized the ladder of rope and wood which hung over the rail as an invitation to visitors  wed better find out first whether theyre willing to have us harry suggested  thatll be all right and jim spoke very confidently if youre afraid ill go first but it seems kinder strange that somebody dont hail us  having made the sallys painter fast jim clambered over the side closely followed by his companions but not a person could be seen on deck the fore hatch was lying bottom upward and the appearance of the ropes indicated decided carelessness on the part of the crew yet no sound was heard save the creaking of the booms as they swung lazily to and fro  whats the matter harry asked in a whisper as he noted the look of fear which came over jims face  im sure i dont know lets see if we can raise anybody and then jim shouted ahoy below ahoy  no reply came again and again was the cry repeated until walter asked impatiently  are you afraid to go into the cabin and stir them up  jim would have braved many dangers rather than be thought a coward and without answering the question he leaped down from the rail running first into the forecastle and then the cabin after which he returned to his companions with a very pale face as he said in a tremulous whisper  boys there aint a single soul on this ere brig but ourselves an theres a sword on the cabin floor do you spose pirates are anywhere around     chapter ii  the bonita   harry and walter remained motionless and speechless on the rail staring at jim for several moments after this startling announcement had been made and there was a decided look of fear on the faces of all three the mere suggestion of pirates was enough to send the cold chills down their spinal columns while the mystery connected with the abandonment of an apparently sound craft caused them to feel very uncomfortable in mind  walter glanced apprehensively over his shoulder as if expecting to see some terrible sight seaward and the slightest ominous sound would have sent the visitors into the sally as the only place of refuge  it was fully five minutes before harry succeeded in gaining the mastery over his fears and then he said with an evident attempt to make his voice sound firm as he leaped from the rail  say boys were making fools of ourselves by getting frightened at an empty ship suppose the pirates have been on board there are none here now and i dont see any reason why we shouldnt go below  im with you jim replied but by taking up his position at harrys side he showed very plainly that it was not his intention to lead the exploring party  ill go too rather than stay on deck alone but according to my way of thinking wed better start for the isle of shoals instead of staying on a vessel like this and once more walter looked over the rail at the sally which was taking in water quite rapidly now that the bailingdish was idle  harry and jim had started toward the cabin before walter ceased speaking therefore he had no choice save to follow them and with an undefined feeling of awe the three went down the stairs into a comfortably but not expensively furnished saloon from each side of which led the eight staterooms  to judge by the general appearance of affairs one would have said that the officers had but just gone on deck on the long stationary table were sewing materials and a womans workbasket in one of the chairs an open book and on a locker was the logslate with the reckoning partially worked out  the only suspicious object to be seen was a sword which had been withdrawn from its scabbard and thrown on the cabin floor the blade was covered with spots which might have been bloodstains or nothing but rust and the visitors gathered around the sinisterlooking weapon without offering to touch it  the sword doesnt prove that pirates have been here harry said after a long silence there couldnt have been much of a fight or we should see more signs of it perhaps somebody is in one of the staterooms  it wont take long to find out and jim boldly opened the nearest door a goodly portion of his courage having returned since the search thus far had failed to reveal any very horrible sight  in rapid succession the searchers went from one room to another stopping at each only long enough to make sure no person was concealed therein and to take a general but hasty survey of its contents  every tiny apartment showed signs of recent occupancy a seachest clothes hanging on the walls and such belongings as a sailor would deem necessary for a long voyage could be seen in one stateroom was a set of gold studs and sleevebuttons and a new quadrant in another which jim confidently asserted was the captains a watch hung at the head of the berth while a small writingdesk was littered with papers  all hands have gone somewhere thats certain jim said when the search was concluded an before we go ashore it wont do any harm to have dinner if the pantry has been left like the cabin we stand a good chance of finding plenty of grub  im hungry enough to eat almost anything harry replied with a laugh so if you know where the food is kept well have lunch before beginning the long pull home  jim was thoroughly well acquainted with the general arrangement of vessels of this size and without hesitation he led the way to the pantry where was found a large assortment of delicacies for the cabin table  in this room were many boxes and packages which had not been broken and as each bore the mark brig bonita the name of the craft was known as well as if the boys had seen the gilt letters under the stern  just at this time however the visitors gave but little heed to anything connected with the abandoned craft save the provisions and these they sampled generously beginning with nuts and ending with jam each one eating until it was an absolute impossibility to swallow another mouthful  during the varied but hearty meal they failed to notice that the brig had heeled over slightly or that there was considerable more motion than when they first came aboard the feast drove all thoughts of the general condition of affairs from their minds until it was finished and then jim said  now whats to be done it seems a pity to leave this craft and all these things but i dont spose we could tow her in to the shoals  even though harry and walter knew nothing about seamanship they understood how ridiculous it would be to make any attempt at towing a threehundredton brig with a crazy little boat like the sally and their merriment was so great when jim made this remark that he thought it necessary to defend himself by saying  ive seen folks tow bigger vessels than this an i was only thinkin how fine it would be to take her in for since theres nobody aboard wed own everything  well so long as it cant be done wed better go back walter said as he suddenly remembered his neglect of duty and the very grave reason why he should be at the hotel before his mother returned  neither harry nor jim believed there was any necessity for making a hurried departure and fully half an hour more elapsed before they were ready to go on deck even then they would have delayed still further had not a violent motion of the vessel caused jim to cry as he sprang toward the companionway  the wind has freshened and if we want to get back tonight its time we were off  then as he gained the deck fear and surprise took the place of his suddenly aroused anxiety the wind had sprung up and must have done so a long while before for now there was no sign of land in either direction unless indeed a dark smudge far down to windward might be the island which had been so close aboard a few hours previous and the bonita was working on a zigzag course seaward owing to the fact that the headsheets were flowing each time she fell off sufficiently to get the wind abaft the beam she would fill her topsails and gather way then come to stop and again fall off making as a sailor would say boards and halfboards  harry and walter were so thoroughly amazed and alarmed by this sudden disappearance of the land as it were that they gave no heed to anything around them but stood by the port rail amidships searching in vain with their eyes for the island  jims knowledge of seamanship was decidedly limited but he understood fully why the isle of shoals was no longer in sight and his one thought was how they could leave the vessel which was literally running away with them springing to the main chains where the sally had been made fast a single glance was sufficient to show of what little service she would be to them just then leaking as she did and towed now and then at a rapid rate the little craft was filled with water nothing save a very small portion of the bow upheld by the painter being visible  hardly knowing what he did the young fisherman ran fore and aft in a distracted way until harry aroused from his stupefaction by jims apparently aimless movements asked in a sharp tone of nervous irritation  what are you doing are we to stay here without trying to get back  i wish you would tell me what we can do and jim stopped short as he plunged his hands deeply in his pockets looking harry squarely in the face the isle of shoals must be a dozen miles away by this time the sally is swamped an theres nothin in the shape of a boat on board  but we cant stay here and be carried out to sea walter cried in a shrill tone of fear  if you think its possible to swim back we wont stay but i dont know of any other way to get there  for an instant walter acted as if he intended to make the attempt and then as harry seized his arm to prevent him from leaping overboard the poor boy gave way to the most passionate grief he began to realize the full consequences of his disobedience and could he have been transported to the land just at that moment bessie would have opened her eyes wide in surprise at the great display of brotherly affection  it seemed as if walters tears served to restore to jim at least a portion of his senses for he immediately assumed a businesslike tone as he said  now see here fellers were in a scrape of course but it wont do any good to give up like this cause if we try to help ourselves things may turn out all right  if we cant get back in the sally i dont see how were going to help ourselves very much and harry made every effort to appear brave that walter might be cheered  some vessel will surely heave in sight before long an we can signal to her the first thing is to find a flag an set it halfmast uniondown any craft would try to find out what the matter was after seein a thing like that an jes as likely as not well be picked up before dark then we must get some of this canvas off of her so she cant sail so fast an when thats done matters wont be so very bad for we can keep goin straight ahead till we come out somewhere  jim spoke in such a matteroffact tone that the courage of his companions was revived at once they had not thought of the possibility that a vessel might be sighted but now it seemed very probable and the two boys set about the proposed task with hopeful hearts  the wind continued to freshen and in her limping way the bonita worked slowly but surely seaward with a wide expanse of ocean before her while the force on board was hardly sufficient to keep the helm steady in heavy weather     chapter iii  a small crew   as they searched for the flaglocker jim did his best to keep hope alive in the hearts of his companions by talking as if it was impossible they could run many hours longer without meeting some craft from which assistance could be procured but even as he spoke he knew it would not be strange if a week or even more elapsed before anything larger than a seabirds wing came within their range of vision he had been in the mary walker on the fishing banks when it was known there were many vessels in the vicinity and yet not a sail was seen for ten days while the wind held in the same direction the bonita would be too far north to sight any of the coastwise traders and jim was well aware that it might be a long while before they could summon aid  the flaglocker was found after a short search and when the stars and stripes were hoisted as a signal of distress the bright colors appeared to afford harry and walter no slight amount of relief  if a vessel comes within sight that must attract attention harry said hopefully i dont suppose any captain would pass us by without at least asking what was the matter  it would be a pretty mean sailor who wouldnt try to help us jim replied and then as the thought came that it might be many days before the flag would be seen by any one save themselves he added in a voice which was far from steady now lets try to hoist the sally inboard shell be knocked to pieces if we tow her an theres no knowin how soon she may be needed  tell us what to do and well obey orders harry said cheerily im not sure but we can run this craft as well as a full crew could so long as you know enough to be captain  jim was thoroughly well aware of his own ignorance but no good could be gained by admitting such a fact and he began to give commands in a very loud tone as if the noise would drive away his dismal forebodings  there was no lack of blocks which could be used and by fastening a whip to the sallys bow she was soon hauled in over the rail minus her cargo of water  if we stay here long enough we must calk the seams jim said as he wiped the perspiration from his face it wont be a hard job an we may need her pretty bad  why not do it now walter asked  because we ought to got some of this canvas in before it blows any harder but it would puzzle a better sailor than i am to know how its to be done unless we leave everything loose  neither harry nor walter could give any advice and jim was forced to work out the problem unaided  ill tell you what it is he said after studying the matter in silence several moments it wont do to strip her entirely for then we couldnt keep steerageway on the jib foretopsail and mainsail wont be moren enough to steady her and if the wind dont come any stronger i reckon we can take care of the helm  do you mean that were to pull down them big pieces of canvas walter asked in dismay  if i did mean that it couldnt be done by carrying the halyards to one of the winches though we can clew them up after awhile but itll be kinder hard work  then jim set about the task which at first sight appeared to be impossible and incredible though it may seem had before dark stripped the brig of all the canvas save what he proposed to keep her under while the weather remained fair his slight knowledge of seamanship was sufficient to show him how work should be performed and with the winch as a very material aid the huge squares of canvas were clewed up after rather a clumsy fashion  when this had been done jim went to the helm which he lashed in one position when the task of shortening sail was first begun and soon the bonita was sailing properly dead before the wind but in a lazy manner as if sulking because deprived of so many of her white wings  thats a good job well over he said with a longdrawn sigh of relief now if it blows very hard we can soon get rid of the mainsail and jib  where are we heading for harry asked the severe labor having in a certain measure dulled the grief in his heart  i dont knowstraight across the ocean i reckon jim replied and then observing that his companions had noted the look of anxiety on his face he added in a lighter tone it seems kinder funny that we three boys should be sailin this craft like as if she was our owndont it  i wish wed never seen her nor the sally walker walter cried passionately nobody knows when we can get back and our parents will think we meant to run away  now dont get to feelin bad agin jim said soothingly it wont do any good an youll be jes so much the worse off weve got to have supper an wholl be cook  ill do what i can toward it but i dont believe id know how to make even so much as a cup of tea and harry rose to his feet  jes bring up a lot of grub from the pantry thatll be enough tomorrow ill show you how to steer an take a turn in the galley myself  harry beckoned walter to follow him for if the truth must be told he felt rather nervous about going into the cabin alone now that they were on the open ocean at the mercy of wind and wave the deserted saloon seemed peopled with things none the less horrible because unseen every inanimate object had suddenly taken on a most sinister appearance and the rusty sword on the floor seemed to bear witness of the tragedy which had caused a sound wellfound vessel to be abandoned in such haste  neither of the boys cared to look around the saloon in which the shadows of night were gathering they walked swiftly through into the pantry selected such articles of food as were nearest at hand and then went on deck very quickly  jim had lashed the helm again and was in the maintop looking seaward in the vain hope of seeing a sail and his apparent calmness together with the warm breeze the water sparkling under the rays of the setting sun and the regular movement of the brig as she rose and fell on the swell served to banish the fears caused by that desolatelooking cabin  when twilight came that time when homesickness always appears with redoubled violence the three involuntary voyagers were eating a meal composed chiefly of delicacies and jim understood that his companions must be prevented from dwelling upon their own condition therefore as a means of cheering all hands himself included he proposed to spin a yarn in true sailor fashion  from the number of socalled ghost stories which the crew of the mary walker were wont to relate during their leisure moments he chose the most horrible and some time before it was concluded he understood that he had succeeded in banishing homesickness at the expense of an invitation to fear even he himself began to be afraid because of his own yarn when it was told on the deck of a vessel so mysteriously abandoned as had been the bonita and the sighing of the nightwind through the rigging sounded very ghostly in his ears  the three boys huddled close together neither speaking above a whisper until after the moon rose and then matters began to seem more cheerful jim changed the unpleasant current of thought by speculating upon the strange sights they might see if it was possible for them to keep the brig on the same course until they made land and by ten oclock all hands had so far gained the mastery over fear that the young captain proposed an arrangement for the night  we cant stay awake all the time he said sagely so sposin you fellers go below an turn in if the wind dies out much more ill lash the wheel an join you but if it dont one of you will have to spell me long toward mornin  i dont care about going below walter replied in a halfwhisper why cant we sleep out here on deck  theres nothin to prevent it but youll be cold before mornin if you dont get some blankets from the cabin  even harry was timid about venturing into the saloon since that particularly horrible ghost story had been told and very likely jim understood this fact for he said after a brief pause  if youll hold the wheel walter an harry will come with me ill get the bedclothes  this proposition was accepted and a few moments later a mattress and half a dozen blankets were spread out on the deck aft the whole forming such a bed as even less tired boys would not have despised  there was yet sufficient food remaining from the supply brought for supper to serve as a lunch in case any of the party grew hungry before daylight therefore as jim said they were pretty well fixed for the night the wind was decreasing each moment and regardless of the possibility that it might spring up again from a different quarter the helm was lashed amidships that all hands might sleep  i reckon some of us will wake up if it blows hard an considering that we dont know where were goin it cant make much difference whether anybody is at the wheel or not  the young fisherman laid down as he ceased speaking and his companions in blissful ignorance of the possible danger to be incurred by this unseamanlike proceeding seeing nothing rash or strange in thus leaving the brig to care for herself followed the example of their commander  the bed was hardly as soft as harry and walter had been accustomed to sleeping on perhaps but it was not uncomfortable and in a few moments all three were in dreamland     chapter iv  a voice from the sea   the small crew of the bonita were weary almost to the verge of exhaustion excitement and grief had fatigued them even more than the long pull in the sally therefore all three slept as soundly as if they had been snugly tuckedup in bed at home and when the sun came from his bath in the sea they were yet unconscious that another day had dawned  when jim who was the first to awaken opened his eyes he rose suddenly to a sitting posture with a misty idea that his slumbers had been disturbed by the sound of a human voice  it was several seconds before he fully realized where he was but the deserted deck of the brig and the sally upturned on the main hatch soon brought back to his mind all the strange occurrences of the previous day after which he began to speculate whether it was in a dream that he heard a low feeble hail of brig ahoy  harry and walter were both asleep consequently neither of them had spoken rising to his feet he gazed eagerly over the placid ocean but without seeing the ardentlylongedfor sail  i reckon i was dreaming he said to himself and then the thought of their lonely position drove everything else from his mind we must be out of the track of vessels or one would be in sight by this time and when the next storm comes up itll be goodby all hands for we cant manage a craft like this in a gale i aint sure but  brig ahoy ahoy  this time there was no mistake it was a hail hardly more than a whisper but yet so distinct as to prevent any possibility that it was a trick of the imagination one would have said it came from the sea directly beneath the brigs stern and jims face grew pale with fear as he looked quickly around without seeing so much as a floating timber  theres something wrong about this craft he muttered sailors dont run away from a sound vessel without a pretty good reason an i reckon shes haunted  brig ahoy help a dying man ahoy on board  the words were spoken more feebly than before and jim thoroughly convinced he had heard something supernatural awakened his companions by shaking them nervously  get up quick he said in a hoarse whisper this brig has been hailed three times an there isnt even a fly in sight  harry and walter were on their feet in an instant gazing around in bewilderment but seeing nothing and after jim had told his story he asked in a voice trembling with fear  what shall we do id rather take my chances on the sally even if we are out of sight of land than stay here another minute this brig has got ghosts aboard  i dont hear anything harry said the bright sun and sparkling water investing the vessel with a sense of life and animation directly at variance with any supposed supernatural visitations youre mistaken jim thats all  wait a little while jim replied shaking his head gravely as if the subject was too serious to admit of any discussion  the boys were destined to be skeptical but a few seconds longer before another moment had passed a low groan was heard as if coming from beneath their feet and all three instinctively ran across the deck to the starboard rail to put the greatest possible distance between themselves and the unearthly sound  this short flight was the one thing needed to reveal the seeming mystery for as jim leaped into the main rigging with the intention of going aloft if the ghostly voice was heard again he involuntarily glanced downward  look look there he cried excitedly pointing toward the water and following with their eyes the direction indicated by his trembling hand the boys saw a whitehallbuilt boat about twenty feet long made fast to the mainchains an oar lashed to one of the thwarts served as a mast and fastened to this was a small piece of canvas  all these details were not at first remarked for in the bottom lying face downward as if dead was a man his outstretched hands looked like claws so tightly was the skin drawn over the bones and even though covered with clothing it could be seen that his body was wasted almost to a skeleton  unaccustomed though harry and walter were to such sights it was not necessary for jim to explain that the occupant of the boat was a shipwrecked sailor in the last stages of starvation the night had been calm and he probably propelled his craft with oars after the wind died away making her fast to the mainchains as he uttered the cry which awakened jim and ceasing his appeal for help only when consciousness deserted him  it was several moments that the boys stood gazing at these mute evidences of agony without making any effort to relieve the sufferer and then harry asked  cant we do something to help him perhaps instead of being dead he has only fainted  i ought to be kicked for standin here like a fool jim exclaimed as he clambered over the side and an instant later he was lifting the man to a sitting posture crying meanwhile bring some water quick  walter ran into the cabin all fear of the place having been banished by the desire to aid the sufferer and in a few seconds passed a pitcher of water into the boat  jim was an awkward nurse but his patient had more vitality than was apparent at the first glance and before the boy could bathe his face thoroughly he had revived sufficiently to grasp the pitcher with both hands drinking most greedily  dont let him have all he wants harry cried ive heard that people who have been almost starved shouldnt have too much at a time  jim tried to wrest the pitcher from the mans desperate clutch but he swallowed the liquid more eagerly and the boy was forced to exert all his strength in order to accomplish his purpose  wait a bit he said as he held the vessel behind him you can drink till you bust after a spell but i reckon harrys right about takin too much just now  the man looked fiercely at jim for an instant as if about to spring upon him and thus obtain that which would quench his burning thirst and then controlling himself with an effort he asked in a whisper  where are the crew  there aint any on board us three boys are alone have you got strength enough to climb over the rail  instead of answering the question the man attempted to rise to his feet but his limbs refused to obey the will and he sank back on the thwart as if about to relapse into unconsciousness again  here drink some more water jim cried quickly and when the sufferer had swallowed half a dozen mouthfuls eagerly he shouted to the others lean over the rail and try to get hold of him  at the same moment he lifted the emaciated formhe had often raised heavier burdensuntil those above could seize him under the arms after which the remainder of the task was easy of accomplishment  harry and walter carried the sailor to the mattress on the port side lying him upon it tenderly and while they were thus occupied jim climbed on deck once more running directly to the pantry  a case of canned soup was among the stores and without waiting to select any particular kind he seized one of the tins and carried it to the galley  to build so much of a fire as would be sufficient to heat the soup was but the work of a few moments and then he carried a bowl full of the nourishing food aft saying as he handed it to the starving man  i dont reckon itll do you any harm to eat this ill get a spoon an one of us fellers will feed you  there was no necessity for any such preparation the sailor still had strength enough to raise the bowl to his lips and in the shortest possible space of time it had been drained of its contents  i spose you could pump two or three gallons into him before hed know there was anything inside jim said in a low tone to harry as the sufferer laid back on the pillows with closed eyes whatll we do give him some more  hold on a few minutes and see if he asks for it i think hes going to sleep  jim went forward again where he could be alone while thinking over this addition to their number and instead of finding relief in the coming of the stranger it seemed to him as if the matter had grown more complicated  it was tough enough for us before he said as he went into the galley but what were goin to do with a sick man on our hands beats me  he was not in so much despair as to forget that as yet they had not breakfasted however and he at once set about preparing a reasonably elaborate meal  the wind was not sufficient to lift the narrow thread of blue which hung from the masthead the brig rose and fell on the lazy swell swinging her bow from one point of the compass to another under the influence of ocean currents or eddies and there was nothing to claim jims attention save the culinary duties he had thus voluntarily assumed  before breakfast was ready harry came into the galley for more soup explaining that the stranger had awakened and asked for food and by the time the invalid was fed again jim called his companions to partake of the result of his labors  the boys talked of little else while they were eating save regarding the man who slumbered on the mattress aft his coming had temporarily driven from their minds the sorrow caused by the enforced absence from home and in this respect at least it was productive of good  theres one thing about it jim said when the conversation was ended with the meal and they had failed to realize that the shipwrecked man might be of great assistance in the future his boat is a long ways ahead of the sally an i wouldnt be afraid to sail anywhere in her she ought to be hoisted inboard an if hes asleep now wed better try to hook her on the davitfalls  the man was asleep and before washing the breakfast dishes jim made preparations for securing the boat which he rightly believed would be so valuable when the time came to abandon the bonita  this work was by no means easy of accomplishment even though there was neither sea nor wind to interfere with the laborers but it was finally finished successfully and the young captain had no slight satisfaction in the thought that he and his crew were now well prepared for the worst  it was two hours past noon before the rescued man awakened again and jim had more soup heated this time allowing his patient to eat and drink all he wished  go ahead he said as he served the food aft placing a number of dishes on the house for theres plenty aboard to fill up a man twice your size call on us for what you want an i reckon we can find it  the sailor was greatly refreshed by this third meal and when it was concluded the ghastly look on his face had given place to what appeared very much like evidence of returning strength  tell me how you boys happen to be on board here alone he asked and jim began at once to relate their misadventures which commenced with the cruise in the sally  we dont feel very much like stayin on this vessel for of course theres something wrong about her or the crew wouldnt a left everything behind he said in conclusion but we couldnt start away in the sally cause she leaks so bad now that weve got your boat we can say goodby to the brig as soon as youre well  whats the use of abandonin a good craft like this  cause we cant manage her ananwell to tell the truth im kinder afraid  the stranger smiled as if he thought jims fears very foolish but at the same time he could give no reasonable guess as to why the bonita had been abandoned     chapter v  bob braces story   as a matter of course the boys were eager to hear the sailors story but no one asked any questions believing he would relate the particulars of what was evidently a disaster when he had recovered his strength sufficiently to spin a lengthy yarn  and in this they were not mistaken  before sunset he was able to sit up and greatly to the satisfaction of his companions he volunteered the information they were so impatient to gain  most likely youre wantin to know how bob brace able seaman got pulled down to a reglar bag of bones like this he said toward the close of the afternoon while the boys were gathered around him  i reckon youve been wrecked jim replied an wed like to know about it but dont want you to talk till youre feelin all right  a sailorman picks up mighty quick after hes where he can get hold of a wellfilled messkid an when its cabin grub thats poured inter him the rarity of the thing helps out amazin i reckon im the only one of the trade winds crew thats alive we sailed from new york for cardiff five weeks ago an had the best kind of weather for twenty days when a reglar noreaster struck us the afternoon of thursday nine days past as near as i can figger there was time to get in the royals an togallant sails before night but the gale kept growin worse so the spanker was downed the main course hauled up an furled an she was put fair before the wind which had been workin around to the eastard by the next mornin we was snugged down with nothin but the maintopsail foresail an forestaysl showin an the old hooker duffin into it mighty hard  it looked as if shed weather it all right till eight bells on friday mornin when every thread of canvas was blown off the spars leavin us wallowin in a chop sea that stove the bulwarks an swept the decks clean before we could heave her to on the port tack by settin the lower maintopsl by this time the focastle was drownded out an all hands bunked in the cabin till saturday when there was no more watches below for she was takin water so fast that everybody up to the captain had to stand by the pump we managed to keep the old barkey afloat till sunday when the longboat an yawlthe gig had been stovewere launched  there aint much use to tell the rest for its like what you must a heard many times we in the yawl had six gallons of water an them in the longboat had a bag of bread before we could divide the stores the bark went down one of her spars striking the longboat an we never saw a soul of em agin i reckon pretty nigh every one was killed by the ruffle the yawl held six all told an im the last the lack of food wasnt so bad till the water give out an then the weakest went first yesterday i threw the last body overboard an this mornin after it fell calm your craft hove in sight  i didnt believe i could lift an oar but it was life or death for sure an i managed to do it losin my head entirely after makin fast to the mainchains an not gettin any answer to the hail thats the whole of the story it aint very much in the tellin but lads the livin of it was somethin a man dont like to think about very long at a time the question to be settled now is where are we an whats the course to the nearest port did you find anything below that looked like a logbook  we didnt hunt round in the cabin very much but if itll do any good well overhaul things now jim replied the sense of companionship which had come when bob brace revived sufficiently to tell his story causing him to lose a certain portion of his fear at going below  the logbook would tell us where the brig was when the crew abandoned her an from that we might shape some kind of a course help me over to the wheel an i can manage to hold her steady while you boys are rummagin  the knowledge that immediate action was necessary to save their lives as well as what might prove to be a valuable cargo had a beneficial effect on brace and harry fancied he could see him growing stronger each moment with but little aid he seated himself near the wheel after which the boys went below to make a thorough search of the saloon and staterooms  the approach of night had already filled the cabin with gloom and to dispel this jim lighted the swinging lamps thus giving to the interior a less sinister appearance the sword still remained on the floor however and all felt that this reminder of what had possibly been a deadly encounter must be removed before the place could be divested of its horrors  it aint anything but a piece of steel no matter whats been done with it jim said by way of reassuring himself and then lifting the weapon very gingerly he threw it under the berth in one of the staterooms closing and locking the door quickly as if fearing that by some supernatural agency it might spring upon him  this horror of an inanimate object may sound foolish when read in print with nothing in ones surroundings to inspire terror but if the situation of these three boys be taken into consideration together with the mystery attending the abandonment of the brig very many excuses can be found for their superstitious fears  the search was made thoroughly but no log could be found the slate on which the brigs position had been partially worked out was the only article which might have thrown any light on the matter and this bob brace could not understand  you see i aint much of a navigator at the best an this bit of figgerin beats me he said when the boys returned with the fruit of their labor if we cant get any idee of our true position well have to make a guess at it how far do you reckon this ere brig has sailed since you come aboard  jim frankly confessed that he was ignorant on that point he described the position of the canvas when they found the bonita and the probable time she had been under shortened sail but this was not very valuable information the statement was hardly concluded when bob interrupted him by asking angrily as his gaze fell upon some object forward  wasnt you in trouble enough when the brig carried you off but that it must be made worse by turnin that hatch over  we didnt do it harry replied quickly it was in that position when we came aboard  then its no wonder the crew took to the boats and bob wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his coat apparently as much disturbed by this trifling matter as the boys had been at the sight of the sword  why jim asked disturbed in no slight degree by the look of fear on the old sailors face how can a little thing like that do any harm  if youd seen as much as i have you wouldnt call it a little thing bob replied in a solemn tone i had a messmate in the old sea queen what shipped on a english bark an the second day out one of the green hands turned the main hatch bottom up what happened why in lessn a month the bark turned turtle on em an all but four went to davy jones locker its a bad sign lads an one that i never knew to fail  what is it a sign of harry asked impatiently  didnt i jes tell you its a sign that this ere craft will turn bottom up afore reachin port an were in big luck to have the trade winds yawl hangin at the davits  well well fix that mighty sudden and jim ran forward as he spoke but the heavy hatch was more than he could lift unaided  it wont do any good to turn it now for the mischief has been done bob said in a lugubrious tone but you boys had better go forard an help him set it shipshape  harry and walter did as was suggested but they did not move with alacrity for the old sailors superstitious fears had plunged them again into deepest despair  dont act as if youd lost your best friend jim said in a whisper when the two came forward its only a mess of sailors nonsense  but he says the sign always comes true walter replied mournfully  that dont make it so if every forehatch what got turned upside down sunk a ship there wouldnt be many vessels afloat hes all in a heap through bein starved so long an most likely doesnt know moren half of what hes talkin about  the boys refused to be comforted it was but natural that they should believe the eldest member of the party and he an old sailor rather than the youngest more especially as the ominous prediction seemed to be in keeping with all that had happened since they boarded the brig  it was a mournfullooking group which clustered around the wheel when the sun descended behind the waste of waters for even jim could not appear cheerful while his companions were so gloomy and as the darkness settled down over brig and sea bob repeated the story of his sufferings in the open boat until the sighing of the light wind through the rigging sounded in their ears like the moaning of some unearthly visitant  what are you goin to do about standin watch jim asked in order to change the dismal current of thought  you and ill have to take the most of it replied bob i dont know as we can do any better than keep her steady as she goes till some kind of a course is figgered out for we aint makin much headway with this wind ill take harry in my watch an give you walter then if we should have luck enough to sight a craft a flare can be started without the helmsmans leavin the wheel hunt in the pantry for alcoholyoull find some there get a basin outer the galley an a bunch of oakum from the focastle well have everything ready to signal an if a ship does heave in sight there wont be any time lost  jim didnt fancy searching through the deserted forecastle and cabin in the night but it was necessary some one should set an example of courage to harry and walter and he went below without a show of hesitation returning a short time later with the materials bob desired  when the flare was arranged to the old sailors satisfaction he proposed that jim should stand the first watch and with a few words of advice relative to the method of using the signal in case it should become necessary he and harry went below leaving the other two sole occupants of the deck     chapter vi  a change of weather   walter could be of but little assistance on deck owing to his ignorance of nautical matters yet in jims estimation he formed as companion to himself a very important portion of the watch brave though the young fisherman tried to appear nothing short of actually saving his own life would have tempted him to remain on the bonitas quarterdeck alone in the night and even with an assistant it seemed necessary for him to whistle very loud during several minutes after bob and harry disappeared in the cabin before he had sufficient control over his voice to hide the fear which came upon him  then he said in what was intended to be a cheery tone  well walt i reckon this is the last night well run dead before the wind unless it blows in our favor by mornin bob oughter be strong enough if he keeps on eatin same as he has today to help work ship an then the brigll be headed toward home  walter sighed deeply just at that moment he was thinking of the loved ones whom he knew must be mourning his absence and the word home caused such an uncomfortably big lump to rise in his throat that it was impossible to make any reply  perhaps the same syllable sent jims thoughts straying in a similar direction for he began to whistle once more and continued to do so until a voice from the companionway asked in a querulous tone  whats the matter shorthanded as we are do you think its goin to help out by havin more wind  it aint blowin any harder than it was when you went below jim replied in surprise understanding by the tone of the voice that it was bob brace who had spoken  thats jes why you wanter tie up the whistle itll bring a gale if you keep on much longer  then the sound of footsteps told that the speaker had returned to the cabin and jim said in a low tone to walter  them old sailors are as full of whims as a dog is of fleas some of them on the mary walker had signs for everything a feller did but i never saw any come true tom downey the mate allers fussed when birds flew round the schooner cause he said theyd bring on a gale an in a dead calm hed either whistle or wish he had a cat to throw overboard  what for  sos to bring a wind he says itll allers come when you do that but of course its foolishness then again if i happened to whistle no matter how calm it was id get a ropes endin cause they think a boy mustnt so much as squeak if id believed bob could hear me id knowd enough to hold my tongue  did you get whipped very often on the mary walter asked with a mild curiosity  more times than ive got fingers an toes whenever any of em from the captain down to the cook wanted something to do theyd stir me up an it makes a feller dance when he gets a good stout heavinline across his back but id be willin to take a pretty big dose of it if i could be on board the old schooner just now  there was no necessity for walter to repeat this last sentiment a severe punishment from his father at that moment would have been a positive pleasure the lightest word in reference to home caused him to realize more keenly each hour the distance between those whom he loved and himself and jims words seemed but the echo of his own thoughts  during fully half an hour the two remained in silence at the wheel steering the brig through the darkness on a course indicated only by the wind and then the young fisherman was suddenly recalled from memories of the mary walker to the bonita  the breeze was increasing perceptibly and the moisture in the atmosphere told that rain might be expected very soon while the boys had given themselves up to reverie the clouds were gathering until now it seemed as if they actually enveloped the brig as with an impenetrable vapor and the waters dashed against the bow with that peculiar sullen sighing which betokens a storm the bonita no longer sailed freely but tossed and plunged like some living thing harassed by obstacles in its path until wearied with the constant strife  jim knew the meaning of this change in wind and wave and he roused himself suddenly as does one who is rudely awakened  i reckon it would be better if we tended to our business instead of whinin about what cant be helped he said grimly clutching yet more tightly the spokes of the wheel youll have to go below an tell bob that a storm is comin on sos we can get in some more of this canvas if he thinks were carryin too much  walter noted the change in his companions voice rather than in the elements but that was sufficient to cause him to move very quickly  it became necessary to look in several of the tiny apartments before finding the two who were enjoying their watch below after which it was an affair of only a few seconds to arouse them bob sprung to his feet before walter had repeated jims words and he awakened harry by saying as he pulled him from the bunk  come on deck lad for we shall need the whole workin force unless our fisherman has made a mistake  to have seen bob ascend the companionway ladder one would hardly have supposed he had been so near death a few hours previous the necessity for action seemed to call back all his strength and on reaching the deck there was no evidence of weakness in his movements  well the wind you was callin for has got here he said to jim looking out into the darkness i never knew much good to come of boys whistlin at sea an i dont reckon any one else ever did  jim had nothing to say he didnt believe he was responsible for this sudden change in the weather but long and sad experience had taught him how useless it would be to deny the imputation and he asked meekly  do you think were goin to have much of a storm  it looks like it but if we had half a crew aboard there wouldnt be any reason for touchin a rope the way were fixed now makes things different an wed better get her snugged down ill take the two boys forard an you ease her up a bit so we can furl the jib come on lads there aint much time to waste  harry and walter followed bob without the slightest idea of what was required they could carry out his instructions when he set the example however and in half an hour the bonita was plunging heavily into the rapidlyrising sea with nothing save the foretopsail drawing she had no more canvas than might have been shown in the most furious gale but under the circumstances it seemed to be all that was consistent with safety for no one could say how much wind lurked behind the inky clouds  now light the binnacle lamp jim sos well have some idea of where were headin an then try your hand at makin tea i reckon this will be an allnight job for me an as i dont feel so very chipper yet somethin warm wont do any harm  bob took the wheel as he spoke and jim obeyed orders the other boys following him closely for the stuffy galley was preferable to the deck where the huge waves roaring astern appeared ever on the point of ingulfing the brig  by the time a pot of tea had been steeped the storm was full upon them causing the bonita to pitch and toss in what harry and walter thought a most dangerous manner jim did not feel disturbed by it however for in his mind was the knowledge of that greater peril concerning which his companions were ignorant the brig was dashing on literally at the mercy of the gale and at any moment might strike a reef or the mainland to the destruction of all on board as well as her own stout timbers for the helmsman had no idea of what lay before them  when jim carried a pannikin of tea aft leaving the other boys in the galley awaiting his return bob said in a low tone as if fearing his words would be overheard  you must take the wheel awhile lad so i can hunt for the charts it wont do to storm along like this without a little smatterin of whats ahead an well make some kind of a guess as to where the brig was when you picked me up  jim grasped the spokes firmly as much for the purpose of steadying himself against the vessels furious plunging as to hold her before the wind and after draining the pan of its bitter contents bob brace went into the cabin  owing to the violent motion of the brig the boys in the galley made no effort to join the young fisherman at the helm and he was left alone during half an hour when bob returned  did you find the charts jim asked eagerly  yes an i reckon theres no call to worry ourselves very much were runnin pretty nigh south an if the brig was a hundred miles off the coast when i came aboard theres nothin between us an the bahamas weve got thirteen or fourteen hundred miles of clear water an this breeze will blow itself out before  look look there jim cried excitedly heaving the wheel down to port as rapidly as he could handle the spokes  bob turned quickly and but one brief glance was sufficient to cause him to spring to the helmsmans aid  there was good reason why the two were alarmed directly in the bonitas course less than half a cables length away a huge fabric of canvas and cordage came out of the gloom like a phantom as if bent on running down the brig  the stranger had all lowersails set and a collision would have been fatal to the smaller craft because her headway was so much less than that of the other  up with the helm lad to meet her as she comes around bob screamed when the wheel had been jammed hard down for a second and the bonita heeled over while responding to the rudders sudden swing we shall clear her but itll be a rub  the stranger had also changed her course by this time and as the two vessels swept past each other on a heaving screaming sea of foam hardly twenty feet apart jim sprang toward the flare  you cant bring her to now lad bob shouted as the boy ran into the galley with the basin of alcoholsaturated oakum even if they were willin we couldnt wear ship  jims excitement was so great that he did not hear the old sailors words when he emerged from the galley the spirit was sending up a blue flame which illumined the entire afterpart of the brig but the stranger had vanished in the gloom to starboard and strain his eyes as he might it was impossible to see any answering signal  you neednt spend much time lookin for that craft lad weve been nearer to her than we shall ever be again an youd better chuck the basin overboard before your fingers get burned     chapter vii  an unexpected danger   during the remainder of that night bob brace stood at the wheel save now and then when jim took his place that he might go into the galley to light his pipe or solace himself with a pannikin of tea  when the young fisherman lighted the flare both harry and walter firmly believed that the ship which had almost run them down would heave to and offer assistance therefore as the bonita plunged on through the dense gloom and over the howling waters without receiving any answer to the mute appeal for aid their despair was intense to have been so near those who might have given help seemed to make their position even more desolate than it was before and after watching in vain for some show of a light from the stranger the boys gave way to grief  now see here fellers jim said gravely as he entered the galley and found them weeping feelin bad wont help matters an itll only make em worse bob says there wasnt a chance for them on the ship to lend us a hand even if they wanted to an we must keep a stiff upper lip till the weather clears a bit by this time tomorrow there may be a full crew on board an the brig standin up for the coast so dont take on so hard it wont be any use to stay on deck cause neither bob nor me can turn in so youd better go below ill sing out if theres need for help  neither of the boys protested against following this advice both were perfectly willing to go where they could not witness the conflict of the elements and when jim went aft again they sought refuge in the cabin with but little heed to what a few hours previous had been a place peopled with phantoms of the imagination  they were yet below when another day dawned and jim prepared an appetizing breakfast before awakening them  the gale still continued in all its fury with the single piece of canvas the bonita plunged and rolled on her way southward for the winds direction had not changed by so much as half a point and the watch on deck looked haggard and worn from the long vigil  during the early hours of the morning while the sun through its cloudy veil was trying to dispel the gloom of night jim asked if it was not possible to stand nearer the land in the hope of making some port and bob replied very decidedly in the negative  it cant be done lad the boys below wouldnt be of any account in makin sail an besides wed stand a good show of plumpin on the coast where there wouldnt be the ghost of a chance to get ashore well keep her as she goes till this wind blows itself out an then take to the boat if theres no craft in sight this brig neverll reach port cordin to my way of thinkin and ill be the first to say leave her when the time comes  on this day there was but little change in the condition of affairs the gale held strong from the north but no sail appeared within the anxious watchers range of vision harry and walter were eager to be of some assistance but beyond taking a few lessons in steering there was nothing they could do and their time was passed in comparative idleness  bob and jim alternately stood watch and slept until when night came again they were in fair bodily condition for the work before them and once more harry and walter retired to the cabin knowing they ought to do a full share of the labor but too ignorant to give any save the most trifling aid  before midnight the wind fined down to a light breeze still holding from the north however and bob said with a sigh as jim made ready to stand his trick at the wheel  ah lad if we only had a couple of good men aboard how quick the old hookers head would be turned toward the coast  in case we dont sight a vessel why cant you put her about anyhow  well make a try to get the lower canvas on in the mornin you an i must have a good bit of help from the watch below an theyd be worse than wooden boys in the night  this was not the only reason why bob made no attempt to get sail on at once he was yet feeble from the exposure and privations of the nine days in the trade winds yawl and although there was but little labor involved in such watches as had been kept since coming on board the bonita the anxiety prevented an immediate return of strength  ive heard of vessels comin in mighty shorthanded jim said thoughtfully as if trying to bring forward some argument which might induce the old sailor to take greater risks there was a fishin schooner from newburyport what lost all her boats in a fog an the captain brought her home with nobody but the cook to help  i aint a questionin that lad the packetship three brothers in the chinese trade anchored inside of sandy hook ten years ago an nobody aboard able to lift a hand but two men and the captains wifeall the rest down with fever i could spin yarns from now till daylight bout jes sich cases were fixed different none of us knows navigation an its got to be all dead reckonin which is a pretty shaky way of runnin even a fishin schooner then again harry an walter aint strong enough to handle the wheel in any kind of a decent breeze an its only you an me we must lay by till somethin moren a good fair chance comes else well find ourselves in a bad scrape  of course youre the one that knows what we ought to do an i aint sayin a word if we run way down to south america but its kinder tough on the boys i can see em when they think i aint lookin wipin their eyes an actin like as if it wouldnt take much to make both yell right out if they didnt have no more of a home than ive got neither would bother bout how long the cruise is likely to last  i spose it does seem rough bob said reflectively but whats to be done i reckon theyd rather loaf round here a good many days than take chances on a raft sailorizin is a mighty risky thing for green hands an while i can hold my own among the best of em in the focastle id make a poor fist of navigation theyll have to grin an bear it sames many a good man has done before em  jim had no reply to make even before the conversation was begun he realized the difficulty of reaching port unless under the most favorable circumstances and now since bob had spoken so freely he resolved to be patient no matter how long they might remain at sea  the old sailor instead of going below where there would be some trouble to awaken him in the event of a sudden emergency laid down on the deck to leeward of the house and a few seconds later his loud breathing told of unconsciousness  to remain at the wheel the only one of this small crew awake and in a certain degree responsible for the safety of all was a task from which even a more experienced sailor than jim might be excused for shrinking but it was a matter which could not well be bettered and the boy stood up to it bravely now and then the white crest of a wave in the distance caused him to start with joy only to be correspondingly depressed a few seconds later as the true nature of the object was discovered and thus amid alternate hope and despondency the two long hours of his watch were passed  then bob took his trick at the wheel jim camping down on the deck in the place so lately vacated by the old sailor and when his eyes were closed in slumber he did not open them again until the sun began to send long shafts of golden light across the leaping waters  what made you let me sleep so long he asked with just a shade of irritation in his tone i was better able to stand watch than you an a couple of hours sleep would afixed me up all right  well lad somehow the thinkin of what might be the end o this ere queer cruise kept me awake an when i wasnt sleepy there could be no reason for pullin you out well square it before dark though now sposen we get a little grub call the watch below sos they can take a few lessons in steerin an be ready for settin the canvas  jim feeling that he was in a certain degree responsible for having thus unconsciously shirked his duty carried out these instructions with the greatest alacrity when harry and walter were awakened they went aft to their teacher in seamanship while the amateur cook prepared a hearty breakfast which was served on the top of the house in order that all might eat at the same time  then bob went below for what he called a double dose of snoozin walter set things to rights in the galley and harry steered while jim stood beside him to make sure the bonita was kept on the course exercising as much care as if it was the only one which could be pursued with safety  although bob had fully determined to turn the brig toward the coast on this day there was no change in her course at noon and for a very good reason before daylight the breeze had died away entirely and at nine oclock the bonita was rising and falling on the glassy ocean with not air enough stirring to lift the narrow thread of blue bunting at the maintruck  the involuntary crew had spread the yawls sail from the house to the starboard rail as an awning for the heat in the cabin was too great to admit of their remaining below and under this all sought shelter from the suns fervent rays  bob found a reasonably large stock of tobacco among the bonitas stores and with this and a short black pipe he occupied himself during the hours of enforced idleness while the boys thought of home and the loved ones whom they might never see again the seconds came and went until the sun was directly overhead and the old sailor had but just settled down for a noonday nap when all four sprang to their feet in alarm as the deafening crush of an explosion was heard  the brig quivered from stem to stern as if from the effects of a torpedo beneath her keel and the fore hatch was flung high in the air while a dense cloud of what appeared to be smoke arose from the hold  astonishment and fear rendered the younger members of the crew incapable either of speech or movement and they might have remained staring stupidly forward an indefinite length of time if bob had not shouted excitedly  its a case of fire lads jump to it for what provisions an water can be got out in a hurry theres no time to be lost if we want to leave for most likely the hold is one mass of flame  these hurriedlyspoken commands aroused the boys from their stupefaction and in an instant all three leaped toward the pantry each took what was nearest at hand and in a very few moments there was a reasonably large but varied collection of canned provisions in the yawl no water had been put on board for the very good reason that they could not find a breaker and jim shouted after they had searched several moments in vain  we shall have to leave without anything to drink for we cant get one of the scuttlebutts on the boat  ill stand a pretty good scorchin afore startin like that bob said decidedly cause you see i know what it is to be thirsty fill half a dozen of the firebuckets while i hunt after bottles  during all this time the smoke had been pouring from the fore hatchway in dense clouds apparently giving evidence of some mighty conflagration below but before a supply of water could be put on the yawl it had fined down to a thin curl of vapor and to this jim called bobs attention just as they were preparing to lower the boat  it looks as if somethin had put the fire out he said and bob replied as he let go the davitfalls  make fast there lads an ill take a look below we dont want to abandon the brig while theres a chance of standin by her  the old sailor went forward the boys remaining aft ready to lower away at a moments notice and in a few seconds to the surprise of all he was seen going below  now thats what i call queer jim said after five minutes had passed and bob did not make his appearance he couldnt stay down there very long if the fire amounted to much  perhaps hes been suffocated and cant get back harry suggested in a low tremulous tone  this idea was sufficient to alarm the other boys and stopping only long enough to make the falls fast they rushed forward reaching the fore hatchway just as bob began to ascend  is the fire very big jim asked and the reply astonished them quite as much as had the explosion  there aint even a spark  then what caused the smoke  the brig is loaded with alcohol in casks made of redoak that kind of wood is porous an the fumes escapin have formed a gas that looked like smoke but which had force enough to blow off a hatch that wasnt battened down then as bob seated himself on the combing and wiped the perspiration from his face he added now we can have a pretty good idee as to why this craft was abandoned there was an explosion same as happened a few minutes ago an all hands thought what we didthat the brig was on fire they hove her to an got the boats over most likely meanin to lay at a safe distance until it was possible to find out what would happen the mainsail was stowed so she had no aftercanvas to hold her steady then she got sternwayon an backed off till the wind filled her topsails when she started like a rocket leavin the crew behind of course she would run a couple of miles then come to an before the men could catch her shed be off once more the chances are that them maneuvers were kept up till night set in when she was lost entirely  the three boys listened with the utmost attention to this very plausible explanation of what had previously been such a deep mystery and when bob concluded there was a look of most intense relief on their faces up to this moment the brig herself terrified them because of what had possibly happened on board but now all seemed changed and she was suddenly transformed from something supernatural to the most innocent and peaceful of traders  then theres no reason for abandoning her harry said halfinterrogatively  not a bit of it lad well leave the hatch open to let the gas out an run her in on the coast if we dont speak a craft that can lend us two or three hands  sposin you could get some more sailors then how would you fix it jim asked remembering what the old man had said regarding his ignorance of navigation  take the chances of keepin off the shore till we sighted a new york pilotboat an then lay claim for a fat salvage  and we should be landed at home walter exclaimed in delight we might stop in front of harrys fathers store which is close by the wharves and i guess thered be a big time when mr vandyne found out who had brought in the bonita  dont count too much on anything like that walt harry added gravely bob said he would try to make that port if he could find some sailors to help him but according to the looks of things now itll be a long while before such good luck comes  we can believe it will be here any moment and then the nights wont seem so lonely nor the days so long  thats right lad dont trouble trouble till trouble troubles you keep a stiff upper lip whatever happens an youll stand a better show of pullin through bob cried in a cheery tone i was shipmate once with a chap what was allers worryin bout findin hisself on a haunted vessel he neverd put his mark to the articles till after hed asked all about the craft an whether there was any ghosts aboard now you let a man go nosin round expectin to see things an it happens that what hes huntin for most allers comes or else he conjures em up well so it was with tomtom byard he called hisself he got drunk one night an the next mornin awoke on a ship bound round the horn with a cargo of railroad iron  it wasnt long before he commenced to hunt after ghosts an this time he didnt have to look very far i reckon the liquorhed been on a four days spreehad considerable to do with his eyes an that very night while they was within sight of sandy hook he saw or thought he did the biggest kind of a ghost makin right for him with a bloody knife tom was on the maintgallantyard with another chap when the thing come he give a big yell singing out that he knowed it would be there some time an over he went nobody ever saw hide or hair of him afterward an the captain put in the logbook as how it was delirium tretretremenjus or somethin like that what killed him  the point that bob sought to make was forgotten owing to the length of the story and even he himself appeared to have lost sight of any moral therefore what had been intended as a strong argument why people should not seek out trouble passed for nothing better than a very improbable yarn  the boys were eager to see the cargo which had given them so much alarm and had also possibly been the cause of the brigs abandonment by her original crew therefore they went below on a tour of investigation which was not very satisfactory because there was nothing but a quantity of casks to be seen  ten minutes in the hot hold was sufficient to gratify their curiosity and then the amateur cook sat about preparing the noonday meal     chapter viii  another signal of distress   now that the boys had lost all fear of the bonita half their troubles seemed suddenly to have vanished as a matter of course harry and walter grieved because of the sorrow their unexplainable absence must have caused at home but their distress of mind was lessened very materially by the belief that they would soon be in a condition to return  even bob appeared to be relieved by what was evidently the solution of the mystery and it was quite a jolly party which gathered in the saloon to partake of the dinner prepared by jim  now that things seem to be straightened up a bit an all hands are feelin kinder natrallike i reckon well get some sail on the old hooker this afternoon bob said when the meal was finished and he had begun to make ready for the afterdinner smoke  there aint wind enough to lift a pockethandkerchief jim suggested so why do you want more canvas  i dont reckon itll hold calm a great while an we must be ready when the breeze does come theres time now to give harry an walter a lesson in workin ship an they need it  the boys had no objection to make for a certain amount of labor was necessary if they ever hoped to reach home again and they signified their willingness to begin at once but the old sailor insisted on finishing his smoke before doing anything else  theres plenty of time he said lazily an well lay under the awnin till the sun gets a little nearer the water  then he arose from the table and as the boys followed on deck they were electrified by hearing him shout as he shaded his eyes from the glare and gazed southward  theres a steamer lads now all weve got to do is hook on an be towed into port set the flag sos theyll know were in distress an well overhaul the hawsers to save time  before he ceased speaking the boys had made out that which caused bob so much excitement it was a small craft coming toward them under steam as could be told from the thread of smoke which floated on the still air and after one glance at her jim hoisted the signal of distress while the others gathered in the bows to watch the welcome approach  it aint a very big steamer the young fisherman said as he rejoined his companions  most likely shes a tug whats got blown out to sea bob replied as he went into the cabin for a glass and when he came on deck again the boys waited impatiently to learn what could be seen  during fully ten minutes the old sailor held the glass to his eyes while a mystified expression came over his face as he said to jim  here take this an see what you can make out it puzzles me for a fact  she looks like a tug the boy said after gazing at the approaching craft several seconds but theres something queer on her bow  what about her spars bob asked impatiently  shes got two short masts andwhy whats that shes flying a signal of distress  thats about the size of it bob exclaimed as he brought his hand down on the rail with a vigorous slap as if to give emphasis to his words  i thought my eyes must be playin me a trick so thats why i asked you to look her bow has been stove an shes workin up this way for help  well and jim lowered the glass with a gesture of disappointment shes comin to a pretty poor place for weve got our hands full tryin to help ourselves  during the next half hour hardly a word was spoken so occupied were all hands with watching the stranger which approached very slowly and at the end of that time she was almost within hailing distance  it was a small tug with a flag run halfway up the stumpy mainmast and her bow stove from the cutwater nearly to the pilothouse a stream of water coming from the starboard side told that the steampump was necessary to keep her afloat but no person save a boy about eighteen years of age who was at the wheel could be seen  she must be pretty nigh as shorthanded as we are bob said and then came a hail  brig ahoy  ahoy on the tug  can you send me some men the steamer is sinking and i am the only one on board  whos running the engine bob shouted  i am and trying to steer at the same time  theres only one man an three boys here cant you manage to come alongside  the helmsman waved his hand as if in reply and disappeared when the steamers speed was checked then he entered the pilothouse again going below once more to stop the machinery entirely when within fifty yards of the brig  by this means the tug was brought so near that a heavingline could be thrown aboard and ten minutes later she was lying alongside the bonita as a tired hungrylooking boy stepped over the brigs rail  i reckon youve been havin a decently tough time bob said by way of starting the conversation  since yesterday morning ive been trying to keep her afloat if some craft hadnt hove in sight today i should have given up and probably gone to the bottom with her  how did you get in such a mess  an ocean steamer ran into us at sunrise yesterday before she could clear herself every one of the tugs crew except myself climbed on board over the bow i was the engineer and had an assistant he was on duty at the time and i asleep in the after cabin the shock of the collision threw me out of the bunk and stunned me i reckon for when i came on deck there was no craft in sight since then ive kept steam on so the pump would work and run in the hope of sighting some craft  where do you hail from  philadelphia the sea bird is a new boat and we were taking her to cuba  how long have you been out  five days from the capes  then weve made more of a southin than i reckoned on bob said half to himself and seeing a look of inquiry on the strangers face he gave a brief account of the bonita from the time the boys came aboard saying in conclusion were better off than you for the brig is sound so youd best bring your traps over the rail an let the steamer sink when she gets ready i reckon with your help we can crawl in toward the mainland an make a tidy bit of salvage at the same time whats your name  joseph taylor the only work i have ever done on shipboard has been in the engineroom and im afraid i shant make much of a sailor  youve got strength an pluck bob said approvingly an thats enough  but i dont like to give up trying to save the sea bird she isnt stove below the waterline is new and is worth fifteen thousand dollars  im afraid lad that we havent got force enough to do very much in the way of shipbuilding and bob shook his head gravely as if to say he thought it a hopeless case howsomever while theres no wind we shant be wastin time so it wont do any harm to have a look at her  joe taylor led the way over the rail and the three boys eager to see the little steamer followed directly behind bob jim whispering to his friends  if this cruise dont end pretty soon we shall have a reglar cripples crew aboard heres me who come from the mary walker you that never belonged to any craft the old bonita with nobody to work her bob as a remnant of the trade wind an now another feller with a sinkin tug its a nice crowd to talk about salvage when they cant help theirselves  just let us get ashore once more an ill be satisfied to have somebody else make money by taking these crafts into port and walter leaped on to the deck of the tug in a discontented way as if he fancied the shuttered steamer had brought fresh trouble and complications upon them  the litter of splintered timbers loose ropes and general wreckage on the forward deck of the sea bird gave her the appearance of having suffered more injury than really was the case instead of a sharp narrow bow as is usual on crafts of her kind the hull flared very decidedly from the waterline to the deck thus giving her greater carrying capacity and it was this upper portion which had been cut into leaving the lower part in fair condition  all this bob saw at a glance after going on board and he at once began a careful examination with a view to ascertaining how badly her seams had been strained  what amount of coal have you got he asked coming on deck after spending fully half an hour in the hold  enough to run three or four days  that wouldnt carry her to the capes if your reckonin is right as to the time shes been out but we might manage to make some nearer port he said half to himself and then added in a louder tone i calculate the hole might be patched up with spare canvas an plenty of tar but wed need fair weather till the job was done  if you could manage that part of it i can tow the brig providing one of your party steers said the engineer eagerly why not tackle the job if the weather should change it would be only the loss of a few hours time  before committing himself to such a plan bob made one more examination of the shattered timbers looked again in the hold and then after lighting his pipe in the most deliberate manner replied decidedly  well do the best we can lad pervidin the balance of the bonitas crew is agreeable an by patchin the steamer up i reckon itll be possible to pull the brig out of what looks like a bad mess  he gazed inquiringly at the boys as he ceased speaking and harry answering for the others as well as himself said in a reasonably cheerful tone  well do all we know how and it wont be our fault if we dont succeed  but even as he spoke he doubted the wisdom of taking another burden on their already overloaded shoulders and that this opinion was shared by jim and walter could be told from the expression of their faces  nevertheless bobs intentions were good with the tug the brig could be towed in a calm and her progress stayed entirely or checked during the hours of darkness when the danger of striking a reef would be greatest an engineer and a helmsman was all the force needed by such an arrangement and thus the voyage might be brought to a speedy conclusion without other aid     chapter ix  the helmsmans mistake   although the three boys had agreed with bob that an attempt be made to so far repair the tug that she might be gotten into port all of them believed she should have been left to sink by making joe taylor a member of the crew the brig could be worked under lower sails and there was little doubt but that she would soon reach the coast whereas by trying to save the steamer both crafts might be lost  the old sailor had already decided what should be done and when the question was settled he went at once to the lazaret for such materials as would be needed joe taylor disappeared in the sea birds engineroom and the boys were left standing by the rail where they could discuss the matter privately  if we didnt have hands enough to work the brig id like to know how much better were off by taking charge of another craft walter asked disconsolately and jim replied in what he intended should be a cheery tone  bob knows what hes about if the tug is kept afloat she can tow us in  unless her coal gives out harry added and then well be worse off than before  we shall only have lost jes so many days for she can be abandoned at any time jim replied  and it is the possible loss of those days which makes me feel that we ought not to make any attempt at saving her walters father and mine would be willing to pay what she cost if they could find us and every hour makes their sorrow greater  well jim said slowly it cant be helped so we might as well look cheerful neither bob nor the engineer would listen to us if we said the tug ought to be abandoned and our only chance is to hurry up with the work  i dont see why bob even thinks of such a thing and walter spoke in a tone of discontent here we are so far from the coast that the tug was five days out at the time of the collision which means ten for a sailing vessel and with half enough coal to get her back what good will it do to patch her up if we cant keep on steam  thats somethin i aint able to answer jim replied gravely these old sailors are queer fish an nobody can ever tell what kind of a scheme theyre likely to strike this much is certain though bob wouldnt listen to us cause he thinks we dont know the meanin of sich work  it seems to me that it would be better to abandon the brig which we cant navigate and go on the tug as far us her coal will carry us harry suggested but to such an idea the young fisherman made the most decided objections  to leave a sound craft for one thats pretty nigh knocked to pieces would be foolish id rather take my chances ten days sail from the coast on the brig than go aboard a steamer like her for a trip half the distance were pretty sure of keepin afloat here but on the tug davy jones locker seems mighty near  by this time bob had come on deck with a spare studdingsail and the boys were prevented from holding any further discussion by the necessity of immediate action  there was not so much as a breath of air stirring the sea was like glass save for the lazy swell which caused both crafts to rise and fall in regular measure and everything seemed favorable for the proposed task  it aint sich a big job lads the old sailor said as dropping the canvas on deck he made his way toward the carpentersroom ive seen crafts bunged up worsen she is an yet finish the biggest end of a voyage  when bob had collected such tools as might be needed he summoned all hands and the work was begun by spreading a double thickness of canvas over the shattered portion of the hull outside fastening it down firmly with copper nails this temporary stoppage of the leak was carried as far below the surface as was possible without diving and when the aperture had been thus closed a heavy coat of tar was put on over the entire canvas outside of this again were nailed light boards which could easily be bent to conform with the curve of the hull and then another coat of tar  this portion of the work was hardly completed when night came and the laborers rested only long enough to partake of a hearty meal prepared by jim after which the old sailor said  we are pretty nigh through lads an it stands us in hand to finish the job while this calm lasts weve got to brace our canvas on the inside so itll stand a heavy sea without givin way an we can work below in the night as well as after sunrise  the air was so still that the flame of a candle would hardly have flickered and the motion of the sea had subsided until the two crafts rose and fell without so much chafing as would even rub the paint there was no reason why all hands save one to stand watch should not work in the hold for they could be of no assistance on deck and leaving harry as lookout in case a steamer should pass within hailing distance the remainder of the party followed the old sailor  by tearing out the bulkhead of the bonitas forecastle bob secured such timbers as were needed and with every one working industriously the task was completed before midnight  a sort of framework had been erected on the side where the timbers were stove and directly against the canvas as a matter of course it was impossible to fasten this except at the ends and a heavy sea would soon wrench it off therefore braces running up from the keelson and down from the deck were put in to hold the whole in place  this was by no means a substantial job as even the most inexperienced knew in anything approaching stormy weather the tug would soon founder but during such a dutchmans hurricane as was now raging she would be as buoyant as when first launched  that the water no longer made its way through the hull of the sea bird could be told from the fact that the siphon which had been in constant use to keep the furnace from being flooded now pumped her almost dry and the old sailor announced as his belief that she was in fit condition to weather any thing save a full gale  we wont lose much time gettin under way he added after an inspection had been made how soon can you raise steam  theres half a head now the engineer replied and in ten minutes we can start  very well while you are lookin after the engine well get the hawsers out the tug must tow alongside unless the sea gets too high for seeins how jim an me have got to do all the steerin were obliged to work it sos to catch a catnap now and then  joe taylor went into the engineroom and before he had raised the necessary pressure two stout hawsers were made fast fore and aft while more fenders were lowered to prevent chafing  are you goin south any further jim asked when the work was completed  no well haul around an steer due west now that it dont matter which direction the wind comes from harry an ill take the first watch so you an waltd better turn in for its little sleep well get the balance of this cruise even if we scoop in every spare minute  those comprising the watch below did not wait for this suggestion to be made a second time the labor of the past fifteen hours had very nearly exhausted them and their heads hardly touched the pillows before both were sleeping soundly  by the arrangement bob had made joe taylor was the only one who could not be relieved from duty and when the old sailor went to consult him as to how it would be possible to keep the tug running he replied  we can fix that easily enough ill let you know when i cant keep my eyes open any longer and then take catnaps on one of the bunkers if you ring the gong once every fifteen or twenty minutes i shall be awakened to see that everything is working properly its risky i know but under the circumstances theres nothing else that can be done  then he announced that there was a full head of steam and bob went into the pilothouse the bonitas helm had been lashed amidships and save in the event of very heavy weather both crafts could readily be steered from the tug  after explaining the bell signals to the old sailor joe started the machinery and for the time being all desire for slumber was driven from harrys eyes by the pleasure of knowing that at last the brig was heading directly toward home  very likely joe taylor was affected in a similar manner because although having had no rest for many hours he stood at his post during bobs watch without intimating the need of sleep  the weather could not have been more propitious than when what was hoped would prove to be the homeward cruise began it is true the night was dark even the stars being obscured by fleecy clouds but not a breath of wind ruffled the waters and the waves had sunk to rest  the sea bird towed the heavily laden brig at the rate of six or seven knots an hour and it seemed to harry that nothing could prevent their sighting the mainland before the tugs coal was exhausted he walked fore and aft on the brigs deck in order to keep awake but during the entire watch his services were not required and at three oclock in the morning bob shouted  call jim and walt we wont take too long stretches on this voyage an my eyes feel as if they were glued together  the sleepers were awakened after some difficulty and when jim went into the sea birds pilothouse bob gave him his orders as follows  keep her as she heads due west an have your eyes open for signs of land i dont reckon there is any very near but for all that we may be to the eastard of the bahamas an it would be pretty tough to bring up on them just now the brig drags a bit an that must be allowed for but youll soon get the hang of it  then the old sailor went into the bonitas cabin and jim was left alone at the wheel trying to drive away the slumber which still hung heavily on his eyelids  walter adopted harrys plan for keeping awake but the exertion was great and his body weary therefore in five minutes after the other watch had gone below he went into the pilothouse stretching himself out on the cushioned locker as he said  im only going to rest myself a little and wont go to sleep it dont seem as if we were below tenminminutesbefore  the sentence was finished with what sounded suspiciously like a snore and jim made no effort to arouse him he knew by his own condition how difficult it was to remain awake and griping the spokes of the wheel more tightly to quicken the circulation of blood he muttered  let him take comfort if he can theres really no need of both standing watch  during the next ten minutes he alternately tried to peer through the dense gloom and looked at the compasscard which was faintly illumined by a tiny lamp the throbbing of the engine the long waving lines which marked the faint swell and the whispering of the night air lulled the senses despite every effort to perform his duties faithfully until without being conscious of the fact his eyes closed in slumber even while standing at the wheel  in the engineroom joe taylor was battling against the same desire to which jim had yielded he shoveled coal raked the fires polished portions of the machinery which already shone like silver and performed other needless tasks in order to prevent sleep from overcoming him but ignorant of the fact that both brig and tug were running wild  the first hour of the watch passed and yet the occupants of the pilothouse remained unconscious leaning over the wheel with his head resting between the spokes jim heeded not the gray light in the sky which heralded the approach of day  had his eyes been open he would have seen through the rapidlyvanishing gloom a long low black line which half encircled the two crafts and told that they were running into a harbor or bay  but he slept on and each turn of the screw carried them nearer and nearer the dark mass until suddenly the brig staggered rolled to starboard for an instant when the tug came to a full stop with a crash and a quiver which sent the helmsman reeling backward against his companion as a rush and roar of steam from the engineroom told of a second disaster     chapter x  aground   as may be imagined jim felt very wide awake when he staggered to his feet after being thrown so violently against walter that both rolled to the floor and his first thought was that all the trouble had originated in the engineroom  the escaping steam enveloped both brig and tug in a foglike vapor so dense as to be almost stifling and for several moments it was impossible to distinguish objects a dozen feet distant  that the old sailor had gained the bonitas deck with wonderful celerity could be told from the shouts of inquiry which he uttered in rapid succession and before the first bewilderment caused by the shock had passed away jim was outside the pilothouse trying to answer the questions  steamer ahoy whats the matter bob shouted  i dont know but it seems as if the tug has exploded somewhere  that cant be if shes still afloat bob cried testily and from the sound of his voice jim knew he was making his way toward the rail  i must have fallen asleep for a second an was awakened by bein knocked down jim said penitently  at that instant a dark figure could be seen coming from the engineroom and a faint voice cried  one of the boilertubes blew out when we struck the rock somebody must help draw the fires for im burned pretty bad about the arms and face  struck a rock bob shouted fiercely as he made his way toward joe who had retreated aft to free his lungs of the deadly vapor are we aground jim  not that i know of the young fisherman replied in a tone of bewilderment my eyes couldnt have been shut moren a minute an there was nothin in sight when i closed em  get out the leadline while i see if joe is hurt very much  the steam was yet pouring from the engineroom in such volumes as to prevent a view from either side and jim groped his way to the brig walter following close at his heels like one dazed master libby remembered having seen the leadline under the port rail forward and but a short search was necessary to find it fully expecting they were yet in deep water he reeled off twenty fathoms or more before casting and to his surprise the greater portion remained on the rail instead of slipping through his fingers  why werewere on a shoal he stammered as he pulled in the cord until the weight could be felt there isnt much more than two fathoms out  an as the brig dont draw lessn fourteen or fifteen feet we can count on your havin slept pretty nigh through the whole watch bob said sharply  jim made no reply he realized now that his eyes must have been closed many minutes instead of one and was well aware that all which had happened was the result of his own carelessness  im in for it now he whispered disconsolately to walter even if bob dont use up a ropes end on my back ill know that by goin to sleep ive shut off our chances of gettin home  i must be just as much to blame as you walter replied in a trembling voice my business was to stand watch and the very first thing i did was to go to sleep  but i had the helm you see an oughter kept the sharpest lookout i wish bob would turn to an give me the worst whalin i ever got cause it seems as if it might make me feel better  cant we get the brig off somehow walter asked with a sob  seeins how the crews so slim it dont seem very likely an everybody will say i cast em away when we was sure of gettin home  theyll have to say the same of me walter added as if this thought might give his companion some consolation lets go an have it out right away  with clasped hands the two boys walked aft fully expecting to receive a terrible punishment for their almost criminal carelessness but no blows however severe could have caused as much pain as was already in their hearts  time was too precious just then for the old sailor to spend any with the authors of this last trouble even had he been so disposed matters in the engineroom required immediate attention and joe was ready to venture amid the scalding vapor once more therefore he followed to render all possible assistance  bend your head low and keep this bit of waste over your mouth the engineer said thrusting a roll of cottonthreads in the sailors hand as he went below  the engineroom was filled with steam to breathe which would be severe agony if not death but neither of the brave fellows faltered by keeping their faces covered as much as possible they were able to continue on groping their way amid what would have seemed like a dense fog but for the intense heat while the roaring of steam as it escaped gave warning of further disaster if precautionary measures were much longer delayed  bob was unfamiliar with the interior of the tug therefore it was necessary the engineer should lead the way and after no slight trouble they succeeded in reaching the boiler from which the vapor was pouring in clouds  the most important work was to draw the fires and by following joes example bob so far aided in this that five minutes later the glowing coals were in the ashpan or strewn on the cement flooring immediately in front of the furnace door  short though this time was it seemed very long in such a place and ten seconds after the task had been accomplished the two were leaning over the rail aft drinking in long draughts of pure cool air  when they had recovered from the effects of the heat sufficiently to pay attention to their surroundings it was possible to see where jims carelessness had brought the brig and tug the steam had thinned down until it hardly obstructed their view and at the same time day had been approaching so rapidly that nearby objects could be plainly distinguished  the brig was on a level keel in the cove of a small island or key the lowlying land which was covered with luxuriant vegetation hardly more than three hundred yards distant in either direction had jim tried to steer her into this sheltered spot he could not have done it more exactly and the fact that she would lie there without thumping except when the wind blew from the east was the only bit of comfort bob could extract from the situation  the boys were on the bonitas forecastle silently gazing at the odd foliage everywhere around while joe and the old sailor stood on the after deck of the tug the latter saying as he concluded a long survey of the scene  it might be worse for a fact but i reckon both crafts will be tied up here till were sick of lookin at mangrove trees  where do you suppose we are joe asked  this must be some part of the bahamas look at the keys all around there is but one other place anywhere near the spot we oughter be which shows up like it an that is the florida reefs we couldnt a made them without sightin cuba or the bahamas consequently we must be further to the norard  should we be near any seaport  nassau is somewhere about but it may be two or three hundred miles away an seeins how i cant take an observation we wouldnt know whether it was north or south did you get burned very bad  i thought so at first joe replied with a laugh but i guess its only skin deepmore painful than serious  you got out of it luckily how can the engine be patched up again  if no more damage has been done than the blowing out of a tube i will soon have it in working order  well get something to eat and then see whats to be done jim he added raising his voice cook the best breakfast you know how to make up for this mess youve brought us into  master libby who had been expecting a sound rating at the very least because of his carelessness was so thoroughly surprised at the friendly tone that he lost no time in obeying this order and as a partial atonement for his misdeeds prepared a meal which in quantity and variety would have been sufficient for twenty hungry men  the sorrow which all hands felt because of the disaster did not prevent them from doing full justice to the unskillfully prepared food and the table had been relieved of a large portion of its burden before any attempt at conversation was made  while youre seein how much damage has been done to the tug me an the boys will get an anchor out aft sos the brig cant work further inshore bob said to the engineer if you can get up steam an the tugs afloat it oughtnt take very long to pull us off this sandbank  so far as i know its only a case of blowing out one of the tubes joe replied  can it be fixed without much work  yes by driving in a piece of soft wood to hold the steam but of course itll make no end of bother until it is repaired properly for a job like pulling the bonita off the mud a plug will be as serviceable as a new tube which cant be had until we reach some port  then youre to find out exactly whats needed an after the brig is in deep water agin we can lay here a day or two to get things shipshape perhaps some craft will come in sight an well be able to find out just where we are  ill let you know  joe stopped speaking suddenly as what sounded very like a human voice rang out on the still air and in obedience to his gesture all listened intently until it was repeated  brig ahoy ahoy  bob actually looked alarmed he had believed the key to be uninhabited and knowing there was no craft in sight when they came below all his superstitious fears were aroused by the cry just for an instant he hesitated as if not daring to go on deck and then ran up the companionladder closely followed by the remainder of the party  surely there was nothing in that which met their gaze to cause alarm on the shore stood three men and when the old sailor made his appearance one of them repeated the hail  ahoy on shore he replied  send a boat will you our craft went away leaving us here and weve been cooped up on this island nearly a week  it wont do much good for us to take you aboard were hard and fast aground  somethin to eat is what were wantin pretty bad the man on shore cried and bob said as he turned to joe  i reckon we oughter go after em but somehow i dont jes believe his yarn  why not  cause theres no reason why an honest vessel would stop here long enough for her crew to go ashore an then agin they havent got a sailor cut about em  having thus given words to his suspicions bob set about lowering the trade winds yawl with as much alacrity as if some one in sore distress stood in need of their services and five minutes later he and joe were rowing ashore  the strangers stepped into the boat the instant her bow grated on the sand with the air of persons who are conferring rather than receiving a favor and making no attempt to push the craft into deep water  its a sailors rule for the last aboard to shove off bob said with just a shade of anger in his tone and the man in the bow leaped ashore to perform that duty after which the yawl was pulled toward the brig  the three boys were standing at the rail forward watching all which occurred but saying nothing until the boat was near enough to admit of their seeing the strangers clearly then jim whispered  thats what i call a mighty hardlookin crowd an i dont wonder bob says they havent got the sailor cut i wouldnt like to meet either one of em alone in the dark  two of the three strangers appeared to be americans but of a disagreeable type while the third was unmistakably a mexican and it was this last upon whom jim looked with the most suspicion  there was no further opportunity for him to criticise them however since the boat was rapidly approaching the brig and bob had already shouted  heave that gangwayladder over an then set about gettin up another breakfast  the first order was quickly obeyed and jim went into the galley to comply with the second as the newcomers stepped on board and halted near the mainmast to gaze curiously around as if taking a mental inventory of the brigs general condition     chapter xi  the strangers   the newcomers were by no means prepossessing in appearance and would hardly have inspired confidence even had their manners been more agreeable  he who acted as spokesman for the party was a stout man with a very long body and short bowed legs that caused him to roll to and fro like a ship in a gale when he walked it was his nose which attracted the most attention for it was not only the most prominent feature of a not remarkably pleasinglooking countenance but so enlarged and red at the end that one could well fancy he had fastened a boiled beet to his face as a partial disguise  the other american was exactly the reverse in form and feature he was tall and thin with a sickly yellow complexion and a little snub nose which looked as if made of putty for a much smaller faceone that might have been bought at auction because it was cheap if noses could ever be sold  the mexican would answer for a type of that class known as greasers save for the fact that he had discarded his national costume in favor of a dirty pair of duck trousers and a blue flannel shirt  in the boys eyes at least the three appeared more like hardened villains than honest sailors and this opinion was strengthened rather than lessened when they were better known  although bob doubted the story they told he had no proof that it was false therefore he treated them as if believing every word and as the first move toward ministering to their alleged necessities had ordered jim to prepare breakfast  as a matter of fact the account which these men gave of themselves was such as could not well be questioned in the absence of evidence to the contrary  they were a portion of the crew of a turtlingschooner hailing from nassau so the rednosed man had said during the short pull from the beach to the brig five days previous their craft put into this cove and they with two others came ashore to search for turtles at this work they followed around the shore of the key until so far away that night came on before the return journey could be made  the other two men had traveled in an opposite direction consequently they were alone but not at all disquieted at being forced to remain over night on the island because in their business such incidents were of frequent occurrence with never a thought of trouble they made themselves comfortable in the thicket returning to the cove as soon as possible after sunrise  to their great surprise the schooner was no longer there nor could the other members of the crew be found they had been deserted but why neither of the party could even so much as guess the bonita and the tug were the first crafts the men had seen and quite naturally they lost no time in hailing the crew  jim was not an expert cook therefore the work in the galley was done very slowly it would have been nearly noon before the second meal could be served had not harry and walter assisted to the extent of making the table ready and afterward carrying the food below  bob and joe had gone about their task of ascertaining the exact condition of the brig in order to form plans for floating her and jim was forced to announce breakfast when his culinary labors were ended  youve been about it long enough to cook dinner for the president the man with the red nose said in a surly tone if i was the skipper of this ere brig ill find a way to make you more lively  well so long as you aint the skipper but only a sailor what says hes starvin to death sposin you buckle down to the grub thats cooked sos i can get the cabin cleaned up jim replied saucily and before the words were hardly out of his mouth he received a blow on the side of his head which sent him reeling against the rail  then as if the uncalledfor punishment had been a kindly reward for services performed the rednosed man led the way below followed by his companions who seemed to think that gentlemans method of treating their hosts was something very comical  jim was too much surprised to make any outcry after looking around to learn if bob had been a witness of the injury he retreated to the galley soothing his anger by shaking his fist in the direction of the cabin  you jes wait he muttered seating himself on an empty messkid where he could nurse his sore face you jes wait an see if i dont fix the whole crowd talk about bein sailors an then cuffin the cook when youre goin to eat aft ill bet not one of them villains knows how to reef a jib an before they leave this vessel ill show what i can do  it is not probable that jim had any very clear idea as to what kind of punishment he would mete out to this man who had struck him without provocation but he believed an opportunity of avenging his wrongs would present itself in the near future and this thought had a wonderfully soothing effect  harry and walter as attendants upon the guests were treated with no more consideration than that shown jim when the men seated themselves at the table both boys went toward the companionway as if to go on deck but the thin man cried gruffly  stay here you young cubs we may need somethin more an in that case youre to bring it  just for an instant harry glanced at walter as if questioning whether they should obey and then evidently concluding discretion was the better part of valor he retreated to one corner of the cabin where he would be ready to obey the commands of these strange guests  during the next ten minutes the men ate voraciouslynot as if they had been on the verge of starvation but like pigs and at the end of that time he with the red nose asked as he rested both elbows on the table and picked his teeth with a fork  where does this brig hail from  i dont know walter replied after waiting in vain for harry to speak  dont know havent you got sense enough to tell where you come from  we belong in new york while we were at the isle of shoals jim and harry and i rowed out to the brig and found her abandoned then the wind sprung up and she ran away with us  where did the old sailor come aboard the man asked after exchanging glances with his companions  walter told him in the fewest possible words how bob had become a member of the party and also in what condition the sea bird was when joe linked his fortunes with theirs  how happened it that you run ashore here the mexican asked and this question harry answered  then youve got no more right aboard this craft than we have the first speaker said an i reckon well stick by the ship do you know where theres any tobacco  no i havent seen a piece except that which bob has  then hunt for some in a wellfound craft like this theres sure to be plenty  we dont know anything about it and do not intend to look harry said decidedly as he retreated toward the companionway taking up his stand directly in front of walter  ill have to give you a lesson the sames i did the other fellow the rednosed man cried in an angry tone are you goin to obey orders  im willing to do any necessary work but i dont intend to wait upon you and harry tried very hard to prevent his voice from trembling  thats jes what you will do the man cried as if beside himself with passion and seizing a plate from the table he hurled it with better intent than aim directly at the boys grasping another the instant the first had left his hands  the second he did not throw however as the crockery was shivered into fragments against the companionladder passing within an inch of harrys head bob appeared at the hatchway  whats goin on in here he asked sternly  them boys were givin us some of their impudence an i was showin em the proper place aboard ship thats all the rednosed man replied in a mild friendly tone as if he had simply been doing his host a favor  look here my friend and it could be plainly seen that bob was trying hard to control his temper it wont be well for you to show any one on this craft what his place is we took you aboard believin you were sailors an starvin but well set the whole lot adrift mighty quick if i see any more of this kind of work then turning to the boys he added go on deck or stay here as you choose but dont play servant to a single person on the brig  i allow youre lookin at this matter wrong the thin man said in a conciliatory tone as harry and walter ascended the companionladder we havent said or done anything out of the way how was we to know but they was the reglar cabinboys an when they insulted us jes cause wed lost our vessel an luck was agin us we only did what you would  as a matter of course bob was not absolutely certain but that there might be some truth in the mans statement although from what he knew of harry and walter it did not seem probable therefore he said with less show of anger  well let the matter drop but you must understand that the boys are to be treated as i am the one who acts as cook has been to sea a little and can stand harder work than the others who were never on board a vessel before neither of em are to be bossed or scolded for all do what they can willingly an im standin right by em now that youve had somethin to eat an aint sufferin what do you propose doin  youre shorthanded even if you had only the brig to look after so whats to hinder our workin a passage to sich port as you calculate on makin and the rednosed man spoke very humbly  we reckon on leavin the tug here bob replied gravely shes aground an whats worse bunged up so bad that three weeks wouldnt be any too long for repairs cordin to my figgerin the brig can be floated reasonably easy an with joe taylor aboard i can run her to the mainland pretty nigh as quick as if we had more of a crew  do you mean that you dont care about takin us along the slim man asked  bob hesitated an instant hardly caring to say plainly that he had no desire for their company and then he replied  it aint wholly as i say considerin what has been done an that the sea bird was disabled through the carelessness of one of my party joe has got as much interest here as i an hed have to agree  does he make any objection to helping us out of this hole if were willing to do our full share of work the mexican asked  i dont say he does cause you see we havent made any talk about sich a plan  then find out jes what hes willin to do and the thin man spoke very earnestly well agree to obey orders like as if wed signed articles an before the brig reaches the coast youll be mighty glad of our help  do you know what island this is bob asked as if desiring to change the conversation  its one of the doublebreasted keys the thin man replied  on the bahama bank  yes pretty nigh the northern point of the shoal  then were not more than three days sail from nassau  about that but you cant get in without a pilot an it aint much further to some port in the united states  to this bob made no reply but turned as if to leave the cabin when the mexican stopped him by asking  will you say whether we are to be given a passage or must we go ashore to starve  ill talk the matter over with joe if hes agreed i wont say a word agin it though id much rather take the brig in alone and then bob hurried up the companionladder as if eager to escape from his guests  when the three men were alone their entire bearing changed and the one with a red nose said in a whisper as he shook his fist threateningly in the direction bob had vanished  well whine round only till the brigs afloat an then if we cant get away in her leavin that crowd behind we deserve to stay  and when we do have a craft of our own well pay off some old scores to that meddlin fool who broke up our little game in nassau the thin man added  it will be well if we do not show our hand too quickly the mexican said without even so much as a revolver we cannot hold possession in case they should decide to set us ashore  what a coward you are and he with the red nose spoke in a tone of contempt there are only two of them for the boys dont count an marlinspikes or belayinpins comes as cheap to us as any one else if we wanted to drive that crowd over the rail it wouldnt be very hard work unless we two was the same chickenhearted lubbers you are  the mexican turned upon his heel as if the conversation was decidedly too personal but he made no attempt to resent the insult and the thin man said in a soothing tone  youre talkin sense now pardner but we need them fellers worsen they do us the brig must be afloat before anything is done  of course she must you dont think im sich a fool as not to think of them tricks leave me to boss the job an it wont be many hours till we have everything our own way  then the three men went on deck apparently the most honest sailors to be found on the sea and from his place of refuge in the galley jim watched them distrustfully     chapter xii  signs of trouble   bob was decidedly disturbed by this desire of the men to be taken from the key if the story they told was true he had every reason to expect from the first that such would be their request and yet now that he began to discern their true character it was with considerable surprise he learned that they wished to link their fortunes with his at least to the extent of leaving the island  i dont want sich as them around he muttered as he left the cabin and went forward to where joe was sitting in the shade of the jib with his chin in his hands trying to devise some simple plan for pulling the brig into deep water  theres no way it can be done except by setting the sheet anchor thirty or forty fathoms toward the mouth of the harbor and working down to it by sheer expenditure of muscle  never mind that just now bob replied gloomily for theres another question to be settled what do you spose that crowd in the cabin want  i reckon theyre counting on our taking them away joe replied laughingly most any fellow who had been marooned on this key would like to leave  but i dont believe their yarn about bein left behind unless they were up to some mischief an the captain didnt know what else to do with em  they aint very pleasantlooking customers for a fact but yet they may be honest sailors  i dont take any stock in it or theyd never carry sail as they do the rednosed fellow was heavin plates at harry when i went below an they tried to make me believe the boy had been givin em impudence now they promise to do full work if well take them with us  and i reckon thats just about what youll have to do bob it would be cruel to leave them here and besides we shall need the whole crowd before the bonita can be floated if i could repair the tug in any reasonable length of time it would be another matter but since that cant be done on account of the damage to the steamchest theres a good deal of heavy work ahead  then your advice is to tell em they can stay aboard bob said moodily  i dont see what else you can do more especially since it might be awkward if they should conclude to remain whether we wanted them or not  bob was silent several moments and then he said impatiently  i reckon youre right but it goes mightily agin the grain to take sich cattle as them along howsomever what cant be cured must be endured but ill have my weathereye liftin all the time so theyd better keep out of mischief the sooner we get an anchor over the better an ill call em sos they can give us a sample of their work  he was spared the labor of going below again for just at that moment the three men came on deck and at once made their way forward  i hope you aint goin to refuse us a chance to give you a lift the rednosed man said in a whining tone and bob replied without so much as looking at his guests  joe thinks we havent got the right to say no an besides we shall need a pretty big force to work the brig off the sand sposin you take hold an help us lay out an anchor astern  all right you boss the job an well stand by for every pound of strength weve got  since there was no possibility of using the tug it would be necessary to set about the task as joe had said and bob explained to the apparently willing workers exactly how it was to be performed  weve got to lay out the sheetanchor backin it if the holdinground aint good he said addressing his conversation to the strangers but looking directly at joe she plumped on here pretty strong ill allow but it wasnt moren halftide when we struck an she oughter be worked off in two or three floods one of you get the boat around an i reckon it wont take very long to make ready for the job  the yawl was staunch enough to stand up under the weight of the streamanchor and while the mexican was pulling her to the port bow bob rove a tackle on the yardarm by which to raise the heavy mass of metal  seeing that some important work was in progress the three boys came to assist but the old sailor quickly dispensed with their services  stay aft lads theres force enough here for this job an by tendin to the grub i reckon youll be doin your full share  neither of the boys objected to this plan they had good reason to dislike the strangers and were not desirous of coming in any closer contact with them than was absolutely necessary  by the aid of the tackle the five men soon had the anchor in the boat with a manilla hawser one end of which was made fast to the winch coiled on top  then the rednosed man and bob pulled the yawl straight away from the brigs stern while the mexican hove the fakes overboard as the distance was widened this portion of the task was slow and wearisome for the weight of the hawser caused the boat to hang despite the vigorous efforts at the oars but the desired position was finally gained and after a great deal of tugging and straining the anchor was dropped  joe had two or three turns of the cable around the winch and all hands began heaving on the bars until the stout rope was fairly taut after which a sloper was put to it and the laborers sat down in the shade for a breathing spell  the work was now completed until the tide should rise and then if the brig could not be pulled off it would be necessary to break out some of the cargo in order to lighten her  the most captious could have found no fault with the new members of the crew while this portion of the task was being performed they pulled and hauled with a will making no effort to shirk any particularly severe duty and striving earnestly to finish the job in the least possible space of time  when the heavy anchor was laidout astern joe congratulated himself on this addition to their number and said to bob as they were stretched out on the deck while the strangers had gone toward the scuttlebutt  it seems as if our taking them aboard was a big piece of luck ill admit that they are not over and above pleasantlooking but think of the difference in the work with no one but the boys to help us you and i would have been all day setting the anchor now weve got a good crew of five and theres no question about our being able to sail the brig  youre right joe bob said thoughtfully an i spose im a reglar old woman the way they acted at first riled me so much that i couldnt see any good in em but wed be in a mighty tight place now the tug is disabled if they wasnt here  then the two discussed matters relative to hauling the brig from her bed of sand and gave no heed to the strangers who were amidships conversing in low tones as if fearful of being overheard  their consultation was evidently satisfactory to all concerned for the rednosed man said as the question under discussion was brought to a close  shell come away in a couple of tides at the longest as near as i can make out she only hangs from the waist up and if the anchor holds five of us ought to yank her off without much trouble we must be ready to carry out our plans at a moments notice  then the men separated to walk about the after part of the brig in an apparently aimless manner but all three met in the cabin a few moments later much to the discomfort of walter who was clearing off the table and putting things to rights generally  it seemed as if the strangers had not counted on finding any one below for they looked at each other questioningly a moment and then the thin man asked  why dont you go into the galley where you belong  because its my turn to clear up the cabin walter replied as he continued his work harry is washing the dishes and jims cooking dinner  the boy had no fear of violence since bob interrupted the scene at the breakfasttable and besides he was engaged in necessary work therefore after answering the question he paid no further attention to the men save that he noticed the mexican walking to and fro peeping into such of the staterooms as were open  well you neednt stay any longer the thin man said gruffly if youre goin to live aboard ship the first thing to learn is that youve got no business aft when any one else is here except while waiting on the table  i cant go till the work is done walter replied innocently as he continued the task with no change of manner save to move more quickly  what do you mean by answering in that manner the rednosed man asked angrily as he seized the boy by the collar and dragged him toward the companionway if you dont know your place its time somebody gave you a few lessons  walter was both surprised and alarmed by this sudden attack it had not occurred to him that he was doing anything wrong by remaining but the grip on his neck was so strong and seemingly vicious that it was certain some terrible punishment would follow and he screamed loudly for harry  up to this moment it is hardly probable that the man had any idea of doing more than eject him from the cabin because he did not wish to arouse bobs anger again but walters screams made him furious and he boxed the boys ears half a dozen times with no gentle force  matters were in this condition when the other boys came running aft and one glance was sufficient to call forth all their anger  hi bob jim yelled and harry rushed boldly into the cabin as he cried  if you touch him again ill knock you down  having been summoned from his labors so suddenly he had not stopped even to lay aside the coffeepot he was cleaning and this now served as a weapon raising it above his head he ran forward to strike walters assailant but he had hardly taken half a dozen steps when a blow from the rednosed man felled him senseless to the floor  quickly as all this happened bob answered jims shrill appeal before another move could be made and harry had but just fallen when the old sailor leaped below  what mischief are you scoundrels up to now he cried angrily as he assumed a position of defense after pulling walter from the mans grasp it seems to me youre playin a pretty high hand for sailors who have been saved from starvin  so far weve minded our own business and done all the work we could he with the red nose said firmly but because youve helped us off the key theres no reason why we should take all the airs these cubs choose to put on after youve heard their story an cooled down a bit well talk with you but not before  then with a swagger which was probably intended as a show of dignity the man went on deck followed by his companions just as joe came below to see if his services were required     chapter xiii  defiance   it was some moments before the little party could discuss the apparently serious turn which affairs had taken for harry remained as he had fallen and all their thoughts were centered on restoring him to consciousness  a vigorous application of cold water soon had the desired effect however and in ten minutes after the selfinvited guests went on deck he was apparently as well as ever save for a big red lump under his left ear  do you feel all right now bob asked as the boy recovered from the bewilderment caused by the blow and began hunting for the coffeepot which had rolled under one of the lockers  my ear aches pretty bad but the rest of my body is sound enough though its hard to tell how long we fellers will be able to keep on our feet if those starving sailors stay aboard  theyll go ashore mighty quick if this kind of work is kept up tell us what you did that started em  i dont know anything about it and harry rubbed his sore ear gently to soothe the pain jim and i came when walter screamed and saw the rednosed fellow pounding him i was going to take his part with the coffeepot but before there was time to strike a blow one of them knocked me down  then walter gave a truthful account of all that had been said and done in the cabin and bob thought over the matter in silence several moments before speaking  it looks as if they wanted to know what there is below here he finally said half to himself i mistrusted them from the minute they got into the yawl without takin the trouble to shove her bow off an if i aint mistaken therell be mischief done before this ere brig reaches port  i suppose they think we cant get along without themwhich comes pretty near being a factand so feel at liberty to ride a high horse joe suggested  they shall soon know that well lay aground all summer rather than let sich a crowd of sharks bully us bob cried angrily come out with me joe an well settle this matter one way or the other mighty quick  keep your temper somewhere within soundings the engineer said soothingly for theyre three against two and if it should come to a fight we might get worsted  if i aint a match for three sich lubbers as them ill soak my head in the harnesscask and with this promise which savored strongly of boasting the old sailor went on deck joe joining him as he walked forward  the strangers were lounging near the forecastle apparently indifferent to the disturbance which had been made in the cabin when bob came on deck they glanced toward him as if there was no cause for angry thoughts and then resumed their conversation  dont be hasty now joe whispered talk the matter over calmly to make sure walter told the whole truth and try to find out what they mean to do before you threaten  bob shook his head as if the advice was distasteful but he followed it nevertheless advancing until he stood opposite the men he asked in a tone which to make sound calm required considerable effort  will you explain what caused the trouble in the cabin just now  i told one of them cubs to get outtheyve got no right belowan he yelled blue murder when i took hold of his coat to make him obey orders that brought one of the others who tried to hit me with a coffeepot the rednosed stranger said without hesitation thats about all there is to it we did jes as you or your friend would do when a boy aboard ship was impudent  now see here and it could be plainly perceived that bob was struggling to keep his temper within bounds them lads are here by accident an two of em dont know what work is yet they turn to like little men i consider that theyve got the same rights on this craft as i have an the man who tries to make em obey foolish orders is bound to have considerable trouble with me  there wont be any row if they stay in their place an do a full share of the work the rednosed gentleman said very decidedly  it aint for you to say what their place or work is and now bobs temper was gaining the ascendancy  thats a matter of opinion the man said in an offensive tone me an my mates reckon weve got jes as much to say on this ere brig as you have in the first place she was abandoned by her proper crew the cubs were carried off in her an you jes the same as drifted aboard all youve done toward savin her has been to run on this shoal the tugs rightful engineer is in charge so weve got nothin to say about her but were calculatin on stickin to whats as much ours as yours  if bob had been alone it is most probable he would have struck the speaker and thus precipitated a fight which very likely was just what the strangers desired but joe held him back as he said in a low tone  keep your temper old man this is no time for a row wait awhile  ill soon show how much right ive got here he cried angrily struggling to release himself from joes detaining grasp and paying no attention to the wise advice  you couldnt do better than begin now the rednosed man said sneeringly as he and his companions put themselves in an attitude of defence talk is cheap when a man hasnt got the nerve to back it up  have some sense about you joe whispered angrily cant you see that a row is just what they want  fortunately for all save the strangers bob realized the truth of this remark and instead of rushing blindly forward to what would have been certain defeat he stepped back a few paces to the foremast where he could reach a belayingpin in case weapons became necessary and joe continued the conversation by saying  this talk about your rights is all bosh i was in charge of the tug and picked up this vessel towing her in here any court would recognize my claim as a just one you wouldnt have a leg to stand on if it came to legal rights for both crafts had a crew on board and nobody asked for assistance we propose to hold our ground and before proceeding to extremities allow you ten minutes in which to leave this brig if you go peaceably we will give you one of the sea birds boats and a reasonable supply of provisions but in case force is necessary it may be a matter of swimming ashore  a reglar sealawyer eh the rednosed man said with a contemptuous laugh in which his companions joined weve told you our ideas on the subject an if so be that they dont jes agree with yours then i spose well have to be put ashoreprovidin it can be done without too much harm to them as tackles the job  this speech afforded the strangers no slight amount of amusement and as they laughed boisterously bob seized a belayingpin with the evident intention of deciding the question at once  be careful joe whispered cant you see that theyve got the capstanbars ready for use we should be knocked over like ninepins before it would be possible to strike a blow there may be some firearms aft and if we get hold of them first all the advantage will be on our side  bob had turned to follow the very sensible advice when the rednosed man shouted this time in a threatening tone  seeins how youve laid down the law for us i reckon wed better give you a dose i dont say youve got to go ashore whether or no for its our way to let everybody have a chance if youre willin to say that were on the same footin as you share an share alike therell be no trouble in case you dont look at it in that light then somebody must take to the island but it wont be any of us  dont answer him joe said as he literally pushed bob aft they reckon on settlin matters by a fight now when theyve got the best of it an we must be careful not to do anything foolish  the old sailor walked swiftly away as if fearing to trust himself too long within sound of that mocking voice and joe kept close behind him until they were in the cabin where the boys had remained until the result of the revolt should be determined  sit in the companionway where you can keep your eye on those men and sing out if they make any move toward coming aft joe said to jim and the latter obeyed at once by taking up his position where everything forward of the mainmast came within his range of vision  bobs rage was so great that his only desire just now was to enforce authority and he lost no time before beginning the search for weapons from one stateroom to another he went looking into seachests overhauling boxes and upsetting drawers but nothing more deadly than a sailneedle met his eager gaze as a matter of coarse there must have been firearms on board the brig when she left port but those who abandoned her had taken everything of the kind with them  i cant find so much as a sheathknife he said coming into the saloon where joe stood revolving this very serious turn of affairs in his mind we shall have to trust our fists and anything in the way of a club that can be picked up for im not goin to let another hour go by without showin them villains that we intend to hold possession of this craft  but we mustnt act until weve formed some plan joe replied tell me just what you propose doing and ill stand by till the last  im going to drive them over the side bob cried passionately  just now they are stronger than our crowd and it may be a question as to who goes first  joe spoke in a matteroffact tone but it could be seen that he was laboring under no less excitement than the sailor and the latter beginning to realize the weakness of their position asked hoarsely  what do you think we ought to do  wait awhile till we see how theyre going to act and then the engineer ascended the companionladder to ascertain the condition of affairs forward     chapter xiv  a bargain   it surely seemed as if those who had been carried away by the bonita were to have their cup of trouble filled to the brim running ashore on a pleasant night when there was every reason to believe they were near a home port was looked upon as a great disaster at the time but now it dwindled into a trifle before the dangers which menaced  there could no longer be a question but that the strangers were ripe for any mischief even at the expense of a drawn battle and joe was inclined to believe they might vanquish his party  theyre hard tickets and were most likely marooned here because of their misdeeds he muttered to himself as he lounged on deck to ascertain if the enemy had made any change of position itll take some mighty neat work to get us out of this scrape for we cant risk a fight and its a question whether bob can be held in check  the men yet remained forward where in the shadow of the forecastle they could have the benefit of the light land breeze and were apparently indifferent as to what move the rightful crew of the brig might make  joe stood on the quarterdock nearly half an hour trying in vain to decide upon some plan which would at least promise success and then he went below looking as in fact he felt his lack of hope in the final result  its pretty near high water he said to bob who was making one more search of the cabin with the idea that it might yet be possible to find weapons and the question is are we going to lose this tide without making an effort to launch the brig  what can we do the old sailor asked impatiently it dont stand to reason that them villains would be any more decent if she was afloat than they are now  and before many days therell come an easterly wind which will drive her up on the sand beyond all chance of ever being launched again  thats jes what is makin me almost wild bob cried as he turned and faced the engineer she oughter be floated between now an tomorrow night but it cant be done  why not joe asked calmly ive been turning matters over in my mind and dont see the slightest chance of ever being able to drive those men ashore wouldnt it be better to join forces rather than lose the brig entirely and be dependent upon sighting some vessel to take us off the key  the old sailor looked up as if astonished that such a proposition should be made but before the angry reply which was trembling on his lips could be spoken joe said gently  think the whole matter over before you say anything and take plenty of time for we dont want to make another mistake  bob looked at the speaker angrily for a moment and then seating himself at the table with his head in his hands he remained silent so long that the boys who were watching him intently believed he had fallen asleep  whats your plan he finally asked  it isnt what can be called a plan but according to my way of thinking the only course left for us to pursue weve got to make some kind of a trade with those villains in order to get away from this place and the sooner its done the better  go out an see what theyll agree to bob said hoarsely ill stand by any bargain you think halffair  joe did not wait for further conversation he was eager to take advantage of the tide and no time was to be lost  look here jim the old sailor said when the engineer had left the cabin if joe makes a trade with them scoundrels as i reckon he will something must be done to prevent you boys from bein kicked round for we cant have a fight every hour while the brig is aground youd best stay on board the tug sos to be out of the way when the grub is ready shove it on the table an then all three clear out leavin us to wait on ourselves thatll ease things up a little  while bob was thus planning to save the boys from brutal treatment joe had lost no time in finishing his very disagreeable task  when he went forward the men did not pay the slightest attention to his movements but continued their conversation as if whatever he might do was no concern of theirs it was not until he halted directly in front of the party that the rednosed man so much as raised his eyes  see here joe begun as if to speak was distasteful weve got to come to some agreement for splittingup now when the brigs aground isnt much better than childs play  thats my idee to a dot he of the red nose replied with a leer but it aint us whats makin the row weve got rights no matter if you did bring us aboard an whats more were goin to have em  we wont discuss that part of it joe said curtly you know as well as i do that if thered been two or three more in our party you wouldnt have said a word about rights but since its your intention to take unfair advantage of those who tried to relieve suffering well let the matter drop none of us will gain anything if the brig goes to pieces and its for the interest of all hands to have her launched therefore ive come to make a bargain  well out with it the man said coarsely as joe ceased speaking  i propose that we turn to as if nothing had happened each one swearing to do his utmost toward carrying the brig to the nearest american port and there the whole matter can as indeed it must be submitted to the court for settlement on your part you agree not to molest the boys in any way and they are to do nothing but the cooking we will recognize what i think are your unjust claims until the case is legally settled no property is to be taken from the vessel and so far as possible everything must remain as we found it  an it has taken you all this time to fix up that agreement eh the man asked with a boisterous laugh i dont see but it amounts to jes what we wanted at first look here mister engineer you an bob have got an idee that we aint on the square an its a big mistake when we found you needed our help to work the brig into port an couldnt do it alone we said it was only fair play for us to share in whatever salvage might be made now well agree to your bargain cause its nothin more nor less than what i proposed an the sooner we get to work on that hawser the better cause its about floodtide  joe realized this fact fully and he went quickly aft for bob explaining to him in the fewest possible words the result of his interview  i hate to knuckle down to them scoundrels but i spose it cant be helped the old sailor said as he arose to his feet keep out of the way boys so there wont be any chance for more abuse  to have seen the party five minutes after bob went forward one would not fancy there had been any hard feelings among them the strangers set about the work with a will recognizing the old sailor as being in command and with apparently no other thought than such us was for the benefit of all  the tide had ceased rising it being that time known as slack water when the capstanbars were brought into use and every member of the party exerted all his strength in the effort  once twice three times the men leaped against the stout bars without making any perceptible change in the brigs position and joe began to fancy it would have been as well if he had not humbled himself by making a trade with the strangers  buckle down to it once more bob shouted it lacked almost an hour of bein high water when she struck an there cant be so very much sand under her bow break down once more  no one hung back the rednosed man appeared to have the strength of a giant and as he hove at the handles it seemed as if the wood or iron must surely give way under the enormous strain  grind her down he yelled and when one more determined effort had been made there was a decided movement the bars were started fully a quarter of a turn and bob shouted  nows the time my hearties heave around once an were clear of this blessed key  then every man hove down on the bars as the mexican held turn and inch by inch the heavy hawser came inboard until the winch revolved readily as the bonita glided out into deeper water until she lay clear of the shoal swinging to the grip of the cable over her stern  hurrah bob shouted and the others joined in the cheers causing the boys to come from the galley to learn the reason for such an uproar  its a matter of gettin that anchor home an then when the wind springs up agin we can leave this sandheap behind us the rednosed man said in a tone of satisfaction as he wiped the perspiration from his face before following the example of the others who had flung themselves at full length in the shadow of the forecastle  what about the sea bird bob joe asked when he had regained his breath sufficiently to talk i hate to leave the little craft to the mercy of wind and wave  why dont you swing this hawser right aboard of her the rednosed man proposed the owners may think shes worth comin after an shell lay here comfortable enough unless it blows a full gale from the east  the tug was still made fast to the brig having came off the shoal at the same time and save for the huge patch of canvas over her bow looking as staunch as when first launched  thats just what we will do an itll save heavin up the heavy anchor joe cried the bonita can lay alongside as well as if she was moored and it wont take us so long to get under way when the wind does come  as soon as the party had recovered somewhat from the fatigue of straining at the winch the hawser was shifted to the forward bitt on the sea bird and both crafts gradually swung around until they were headed for the open sea  well have a breeze before morning the thin man remarked for one has sprung up every night since we landed an its safe to calculate on leavin about midnight  after weve had somethin to eat well make ready for it bob said as he went toward the galley for it was fully an hour past noon and the appetites of all were decidedly sharpened  the amateur cook had everything ready and the three boys carried the food below without being molested by those whom they quite naturally looked upon as enemies     chapter xv  an unwarranted search   bob gave an expressive look to the boys when the repast had been placed on the table and all three understood that he meant for them to leave the cabin rather than run any chance of another encounter with the men  a quarrel just now however trivial the cause might lead to very serious consequences because the guests were unscrupulous and stronger than the bonitas crew therefore this precaution of the old sailors was a wise one jim and harry not only realized the fact but they were more than eager to be beyond the reach of these quarrelsome strangers whose blows were bestowed without provocation and they went into the galley closely followed by walter  ive sailed along of some pretty tough customers jim said with the air of one who has had many and varied experiences as he seated himself on an empty keg just outside the galley door but i never run across anybody like them duffers theyre worsen old mose pearson an folks used to say he was the ugliest skipper that ever hove a mackerelline  they act as if the brig belonged to them and we were the ones who had been taken off the key harry said bitterly i wish bob neverd allowed them aboard  so do i and jim spoke very emphatically therell be a heap of trouble before we get rid of that crowd or else i dont know anything about sich fellers if they put on many more airs us three will have to sleep aboard of the tug where we wont run the risk of bein knocked down  we can stand a good deal if they help us get the brig into port walter said with a sigh im willing to be thumped every day for a week if i can get home once more  most any of us would and jim again put on his air of exceeding wisdom but the trouble is we cant count on goin where we want to while they are aboard i wouldnt be much stonished to hear that rednosed man order all hands cept his own crowd ashore any minute ill be satisfied if when the next fight comes bob hits him one crack hard enough to send moren a thousand stars dancin before his eyes a good thump is the only thing thatll make him walk straight  the others would have been equally delighted at such a lesson but there was not time to say so for just at this moment joe called for coffee and harry ran below with a fresh supply after which the boys set about cleaning up the galley preparatory to getting their own dinner  in the cabin matters were progressing so favorably that a stranger would hardly have supposed the party had been upon the verge of an open rupture but a few hours previous the thin man was particularly affable and seemed to be thinking of no other subject save that of sailing the brig to the nearest american port in the shortest space of time  if youre no navigator how do you calculate itll be possible to make the trip he asked of bob during the course of the meal  itll have to be done by dead reckonin of course the old sailor replied in as near an approach to a friendly tone as he could command for the recent trouble was yet too fresh in mind to admit of his feeling thoroughly at ease it dont matter what port we make an as its all plain sailin after were clear of the bank the job oughter be done without much trouble  the most important question is when can we start the mexican said with an odd laugh ive had so much of this key lately that id like to see it a dozen miles astern just now  i fancy were all of the same mind said joe who seemed to think it necessary he should say something if only to show he harbored no resentment we shant have long to wait i hope  by this time the engineer and bob had finished the meal while the others seemed to have hardly begun it was as if they had some purpose in remaining a long time at the table but yet one could not have seen in their manner anything to arouse suspicion  the old sailor and joe arose from the table and went up the companionway ladder as the former said  its too hot to stay below any longer than a feller is obliged to an i reckon you can get on as well without us  the thin man replied that there was no reason why one should suffer discomfort because others were slow and by the time he had finished speaking bob and joe were on deck looking with satisfaction at the result of their labors  we shant be hanging round the bahama banks much longer my hearty the old sailor said gleefully now that the brig has deep water under her keel once more its only a question of wind  i dont suppose it would pay to hang on here until the tug could be repaired joe added half inquiringly as he went forward where the shadow of the forecastle afforded a most refreshing shelter  indeed it wouldnt and bob spoke very decidedly in the first place we must get this craft off our hands without loss of time an then agin the sooner weve said goodby to them new shipmates the safer ill feel they aint to be trusted any furthern you can see em but weve got to mess with the crowd till the brigs in port  joe looked toward the steamer wistfully he had suffered so many hardships and been exposed to such great danger in her that it would be almost like parting with an old friend to leave the little craft to rot at her moorings or be blown ashore when the next gale should come from the east  while these two were cheering themselves with the belief that in a few hours at the longest the brig would be under way again those in the cabin were proceeding to make themselves thoroughly at home  bob and joe had no sooner gone on deck than the rednosed man said in a whisper  now dave you stay here where itll be easy to see if any of them fools come this way an ill make quick work of the search if the brigs papers are to be found we shall run no risk in taking her anywhere an well soon set ourselves up for gentlemen  unless somebody overhauls us for that little job down in the channel the thin man added gloomily  dont be a fool was the savage reply how is anyone to know we had a finger in that pie even if it should come out we wont be in this part of the world much longer we can put in to key west hire a full crew and an hour afterwards sail for any port we like best come on pedro  the mexican had already risen from the table and was noiselessly making his way aft to the room on the starboard side which would naturally have been occupied by the bonitas rightful captain  the rednosed man made haste to overtake him as if doubtful of his friends honesty and the two entered the apartment at the same moment  up to this time no one had disturbed the watch which hung at the head of the berth the boys and bob believed that every article on board should be delivered up to the authorities but these men had no such scruples  he with the red nose clutched it eagerly almost overturning the other in his efforts to reach the timepiece first and against this confiscation the mexican protested angrily  dont be a fool ive only taken charge of it for all hands were to whack up fair on everything  then why didnt you let it hang on the wall  because that fool of a bob might have stowed it away before weve had a chance to take possession now dont stop to chin but help me hunt over these papers  the mexican looked much as if he distrusted the softlyspoken words but he made no further protest and together the two men began to overhaul the contents of the desk  to find that for which they sought was not a difficult task it was only necessary to examine half a dozen papers before the documents were discovered and the rednosed man said grimly as he put them in his pocket  i reckon weve got things pretty near as we want em were the masters now an therell be mighty little talk made about rights come along if were not on deck soon them miss nancys may suspect somethin an we want to keep their eyes closed two or three hours longer  but aint we goin to search the other rooms  whats the use therell be plenty of time tomorrow when were alone  the worthy pedro was not content to wait the loss of the watch for he seemed to consider it such troubled him and he was eager to put something in his own pocket  when he who was evidently the leader of the party walked toward dave to acquaint him with the pleasing fact that the search had been successful pedro darted from one room to another and the studs and sleevebuttons which the boys had noted did not escape his eager gaze  these shall not be taken charge of for all hands he whispered half to himself and the articles had but just been secreted when dave came to the door  do you want to spoil everything by loafin round here he asked angrily these kind of chances dont come every day an if our plans are upset owin to such nonsense ill split you like a mackerel with your own knife  that the mexican was a rank coward could be told by the pallor which came over his yellow face as these words were spoken and with a muttered but inaudible reply he followed dave to the companionway ladder  now what are we to do the thin man asked when the three were ready to go on deck and the leader of the villains replied readily  nothin yet awhile some chance will turn up before were under way but if it dont the matter must be settled at night while theyre below it wont be a hard job for they cant stay on deck together all the time and when the crowd is separated itll be like childs play dont act as if anything was in the wind but be sweet as molasses till the flies are where we want em  then the three men ascended the ladder and from the benign expression on their faces the most suspicious would hardly have fancied they had been plotting to murder those who befriended them in a time of need     chapter xvi  tricked   when the conspirators came on deck and before they finished smoking the boys cleaned the cabin ate their own dinner in the galley and were at liberty to remain idle until it should be time to prepare supper  after the heat of the day had passed bob proposed that all the brigs lower sails should be set adding in conclusion  cordin to my way of thinkin theres goin to be a decent kind of a breeze about sunset an if were ready for it jes so much time will be saved in leavin this place  the three strangers appeared even more eager than he to see the brig under canvas once more and all hands turned to with a will pulling hoisting and sheeting home as if the wind which was to waft them toward the united states had already begun to blow  by the time this work was done there could no longer be any question but that a generous breeze from the south was near at hand thin filmy clouds formed in the sky while every now and then the heated air would be set in motion slightly as a token of what might be expected  theres no doubt now but that well be under way by sunset joe said as he stood on the quarterdeck where the boys had taken refuge from the heat and it would be a good idea for me to be bringing my dunnage out of the tug since it aint likely ill ever see the little craft again  aint you goin to try and save anything else jim asked  there isnt much that we can take suppose all hands go aboard and see if theres anything belonging to the crew thatll pay for carrying away  the boys accepted the invitation readily for they did not care to move about the deck of the brig very much lest they came in contact with the rednosed man and his friends and all four went into the tiny aftercabin of the sea bird where joe at once began his work of investigation  there were four chests here in addition to the one owned by joe and these were broken open without ceremony for the engineer did not intend to burden himself with anything that might not be of considerable value to the owners  well unpack em and then put the things back carefully in case the little craft is carried home again he said going to work systematically while the boys watched him with mild curiosity  there was no apparent necessity for haste therefore joe set about his task leisurely because of the intense heat which made the slightest exertion almost painful and but two of the chests had been overhauled when bob came below to learn what was going on  gettin ready to leave eh he asked after looking at the perspiring engineer in silence several moments well its time for unless ive made a big mistake in them light clouds well start from here mighty soon  if we were going alone id feel tiptop joe said as he paused for an instant in his work but as it is im afraid well have trouble with that crowd before the united states coast heaves in sight even if they do talk so fair just now  we must keep our weathereyes liftin every minute an at the first sign of a row pitch in sos to take em unawares and bob stretched himself out on the port locker as if determined to enjoy all possible comfort before the serious work of sailing the brig without an experienced navigator was begun i wouldnt hesitate to give em the slip by leavin the whole crowd here but theres no chance of their goin ashore after the wind rises  no joe replied with a longdrawn sigh we shall have to grin an bear it i reckon but  he ceased speaking very suddenly for just at that moment a footstep was heard on the steamers deck and an instant later the unpleasantlooking face of the man with the red nose appeared at the companionway  you all got outer sight so quick that i thought prhaps youd gone overboard he said with a leer glancing inquisitively around the cabin but making no motion to descend  joe is overhaulin this dunnage to see if theres anything worth carryin back to the states bob replied carelessly as the engineer continued his work in silence  the man lowered his head as if to see the interior more plainly and unperceived by any one in the little apartment made a quick motion with his hand evidently for the benefit of those aboard the brig  during nearly five minutes he stood there carelessly pushing the hatch back and forth until the mexican waved his hat when the rednosed man suddenly shut both doors shoving into place the bolts which fastened them together  the little party in the cabin looked up in surprise at this singular maneuver but it was not until the sound of quick footsteps was heard on the deck as the man ran swiftly aboard the brig that any one thought of treachery  theyve locked us in here sos they can steal the bonita bob shouted as he leaped to the companionway and began pounding on the bolted doors  the oaken timbers were firm as a bulkhead and without a weapon he might have worked there all day in vain  joe had sprung to the windows but his efforts were quite as useless as bobs heavy iron gratings intended to keep out intruders and break the force of the waves were screwed so firmly in the woodwork that they could not be removed from the inside save by the use of proper tools  they were securely imprisoned for the cabin had no outlet except at the companionway and two or three hours of hard work would be absolutely necessary before they could escape by the doors  while bob and joe were darting from one possible point of vantage to another shouting for help and uttering wild threats in the same breath the boys had gathered at one of the port windows which looked directly on the brigs bulwarks  they aint gettin under way jim cried as if trying to persuade himself that the strangers were not intending to desert them  theres no need for the pirates to hurry bob said hoarsely as he stood in the center of the cabin his face convulsed by rage and trembling like one in an ague fit if i had jumped on em with the belayinpin when joe held me back all of that crowd wouldnt be able to get away come here you cowards an give us a fair show open this hatch or ill foller you till your lives wont be worth the livin  the hawsers have been cast off an now the brig is beginnin to move through the water jim reported as he pressed his face close to the iron bars  this information gave fresh impetus to bobs wrath he rushed from one corner of the cabin to another shouting the wildest threats and behaving generally like an insane person  joe was quite as angry as the old sailor but not to such an extent that his common sense had deserted him while bob strode back and forth he was working on the screws which held the bars in place by breaking off the end of the largest blade in his pocketknife quite an effective tool was made and he had accomplished no slight portion of his task when jim made the last report  rapidly as the engineer might labor however he knew it would be impossible to remove this one particular barrier to freedom before the bonita would be beyond their reach the promised wind had come sooner than it was expected as could be told by the rapidly increasing speed with which the black bulwarks of the brig slipped past the window and the task was not half completed when blue water could be seen as the vessels stern swept by leaving a wake which bubbled and danced merrily in the sunlight  there must be a pretty good breeze jim continued speaking excitedly as if the tears were very near his eyelids for the upper sails are all drawing now i can see that rednosed bully at the wheel an hes wavin his hat  joe continued to work at the bars and now when it was too late to effect anything bob recovered from his anger sufficiently to make at least an attempt at assisting while harry and walter stood near the companionway so thoroughly bewildered by this last blow of a cruel fate that speech was well nigh impossible  the brig remained within jims range of vision but a few moments longer and when she disappeared entirely he threw himself on a locker trying to stifle with its cushion the sobs which convulsed him  without speaking breathing like one after a long race and heeding not the wounds on his fingers inflicted by the sharp edge of the knife joe worked on until the iron grating was held in place only by a couple of screws on one side then standing on the locker he used his foot as a batteringram until the woodwork gave way and the bars fell to the deck with a clatter and a crash that must have been heard by those on the brig  if it had been possible to overtake the thieves the prisoners could not have clambered out through the window more quickly and on gaining the deck the uselessness of any further efforts was painfully apparent  the bonita was already out of the little harbor bowing and courtesying on the ocean swell to the wind from the south which filled all her sails and gliding through the water as if rejoicing at her escape from the shoal  cant we row out to them jim cried excitedly it wouldnt take long to launch the tugs yawl  we couldnt catch em with anything slower than a steamer now that theyre well under way bob cried angrily and then unfastening the hatch he went into the cabin once more as if unable to look longer at the rapidly retreating brig  its no use boys weve got to make the best of what cant be cured joe said with a great but vain effort to speak in a cheery tone we must try and forget what has happened or we shall be in no condition to help ourselves then noting the tears in walters eyes he added kindly think of how much worse we might be situated the sea bird isnt injured past mending and in her we can make any port we choose  but you said it would be two or three weeks before she could be repaired and harry choked back a sob lest the evidences of his own grief should make walters sorrow greater  in that i may have been mistaken lets set to work as if nothing had happened and think only about going home presently with no one on board of whom we are afraid you boys get the yawl into the water so we can land at any time and ill begin the job on the engine     chapter xvii  repairing the sea bird   it was extremely difficult for anyone on the tug to set about work while the sense of injury and grief was so fresh in his mind and had it not been for joe all hands would have given way to sorrow and anger a course which could certainly bring no relief he bustled around as if there was not a thought in his mind beyond repairing the engine calling for assistance first upon one of the boys and then bob until they were absolutely forced to take an interest in the work  he insisted that the yawl must be gotten into the water without delay because his duties might necessitate his going ashore at a moments notice and it was nearly time for the sun to set before the little boat was in sailing trim while the boys were engaged in this work joe called upon bob so often that the old sailor grew quite eager to see the job progress and like the others almost ceased to dwell upon the bitter disappointment  when the boat was launched joe advised the boys to go into the tiny galley of the tug for the purpose of getting supper concluding by saying  it aint as big as the one on the bonita but youll find better tools to work with because everything is new there must be grub enough to last ten days or more but if not well do a little hunting and fishing this is the season for turtles so we can have plenty of meat and eggs and theres no show of being put on short allowance even if we should stay here a month  this remark about food aroused bob from the mournful reverie into which he had fallen for the moment and he said with something like his old cheerfulness as he started forward  ill overhaul the stores so well know jes what there is on board but it wont do any harm for you boys to go fishin now an then seein that you cant do very much work in the engineroom  then he went into the forepeak jim and walter built a fire in the stove which occupied fully half the space in the tiny galley and harry set about laying the forwardcabin table with the limited collection of crockery  joe came from the hot engineroom when the others were fully occupied he had not really begun his task nor did he intend to do so until the next morning when some kind of a bench could be set up in the open air although he had moved about very lively to keep the minds of his companions on something besides their own misfortunes  it was not long before bob finished taking account of the eatables and on coming from the hold he reported  weve got fully half a barrel of flour about twenty pounds of salt pork twice as much beef and two hams theres coffee enough to last this crew four or five weeks with canned milk to help it out two dozen tins of assorted vegetables three bushels of potatoes plenty of salt pepper molasses and vinegar pretty nigh a whole tub of butter another of lard and a barrel twothirds full of shipsbiscuit we shant starve yet awhile but it stands us in hand to do some fishin an huntin before we leave this placeif we ever do  now dont talk that way bob joe said with a laugh i give you my word that the engine can be repaired so of course we shall leave here  how much coal have you got  joes face darkened the fuel supply was the only thing of which he had not thought and he knew there was only such an amount on board as would serve to keep up steam about fortyeight hours  i dont suppose weve got enough for the run across he said after a short pause but we can take on plenty of wood or make our way into nassau where by giving a distress note on the steamer it will be possible to get all that may be needed if we could only manage to patch the bow a little better i wouldnt feel worried about anything  thats jes what ive made up my mind to do bob replied if you dont call on me too often i reckon i can show a pretty decent job of carpentering by the time youre ready to make steam  after tomorrow night i shant need much help so youll have plenty of time joe said with a laugh and then the conversation was interrupted by walters announcement that supper was ready  jim had taken especial pains with this meal probably acting on the belief that grief is lessened when the stomach is satisfied and all hands seated themselves at the table which occupied nearly the entire floorspace of the little cabin looking far more cheerful than one would have supposed under the circumstances  theres a big advantage about living here joe said as he lighted the swinging lamp that the interior might seem more cheerful everything is snugger than on the brig weve got one bunk apiece and none to spare the bedding is clean because its new while jims work is easier owin to the fact of the galley bein alongside the diningroom  yes bob said as he choked down a sigh with a big piece of ham were pretty well fixed considerin an if the bonita had gone to the bottom or been burned up i wouldnt feel sore a bit its the idea that the same villains we brought off the key to save em from starvation have run away with the brig which riles me howsomever he added as he helped himself to another potato it dont do any good to talk of sich rascality an we may as well chuck ourselves under the chin cause things are no worse  then joe made sure the conversation would not again drift into such a dangerous channel by talking of the needed repairs until the meal was finished and the dishes washed after which all hands went on deck to enjoy the cooling breeze  if we could sleep here it would be possible to take some comfort harry suggested as the old sailor made preparations for his aftersupper smoke itll be terribly hot in the cabin  suppose we do that same thing joe said quickly im going to spread the foresail as an awning in the morning to make a workroom and if we should put it up now thered be nothing else necessary but bring the bedding on deck  bob showed that he thought the plan a good one by laying down his pipe and going forward the others followed and in a short time the little foresail was unbent the canvas stretched from the roof of the house aft to a couple of oars lashed to the rail and the boys made up the beds  it was fully half an hour before sunrise next morning when bob called all hands and the task of repairing the sea bird was begun without delay joe had his tools and spare fittings on deck by the time breakfast was ready and bob mapped out his work during the same interval  you boys are to go ashore the old sailor said when the little party had gathered around the table we havent got much water an if you can find a spring itll save wastin coal to condense whatll be needed  an excursion on the island was by no means a hardship and but little time was spent setting the galley and cabin to rights after the meal had been brought to an end  the key aint so small but that you can get lost on it an not half try bob shouted as jim and harry took up the oars leaving walter to play the part of coxswain keep your bearings well in mind an dont go far from the shore  jim waved his hand to show that the commands were understood and then the little boat was propelled swiftly toward the key  bob watched the boys until they landed fastened the yawl by tying the painter around a projecting piece of coral and disappeared in the underbrush after which he went aft where joe had set up a very shaky workbench and was busily engaged measuring a plate of metal  them two citybred youngsters are having the worst end of this queer cruise the sailor said thoughtfully to an old mossback like me it dont make much difference whether hes on the bahamas or the sandwich islands providin theres plenty of grub but the lads must come pretty nigh eatin their hearts out sometimes when they think of home an the sadness thats in it through their disappearin so mysteriouslike  its tough on them and thats a fact joe replied but they keep the trouble to themselves in a way that ought to teach us a lesson a man or a boy either for that matter should put his best foot forward no matter how hard a place he gets in an then half the battles won before a blow can be struck  joe had no opportunity to continue the subject because bob walked into the cabin the conversation was growing altogether too personal to please the old sailor for he knew perfectly well that he had been more than foolish in giving such free rein to his temper and grief when the perfidy of the strangers was first made apparent and like many others he did not care to be told of his faults  he proposed to further repair the damage done the sea bird by planking outside the canvas and to procure the necessary lumber he must take it from the bulkhead between the aftercabin and the engineroom  this he now proceeded to do and while the pounding and hammering went on below as if the little steamer was being torn to pieces joe continued what was both a difficult and laborious task a piece of metal such as could have been cut and planed down into the required shape in half a day with the proper tools he was forced to fashion from thick plates with nothing more effective than a file although accustomed to look upon the bright side of trouble it was impossible to conceal from himself the unpleasant fact that two or three weeks might elapse before the job could be finished satisfactorily and during such time a gale from the east might make the sea bird a total wreck  these disagreeable thoughts did not prevent him from working industriously on what seemed an almost endless task and he had not ceased his labors for a single moment even though fully two hours were passed when a loud noise from the shore attracted his attention  something has gone wrong with the boys he shouted and bob rushed on deck in the greatest excitement as he asked impatiently  whats the matter have you seen anything  no but listen to that yelling it isnt possible they have found human beings on the key and unless theyre in trouble i dont see why there should be such an uproar  there was but little time for speculation almost before joe ceased speaking the boys came from the underbrush at full speed and leaped into the boat after launching her jim and walter pulling energetically at the oars while harry waved some small object above his head     chapter xviii  a singular document   in order to better understand the cause of the boys excitement it will be well to follow them from the time they stepped ashore on the little key in search of water otherwise it might require the reader more time than it did bob and joe to learn all the details of the story  the novelty of standing on the solid earth once more after having been tossed about by the sea was very pleasant and the boys enjoyed it hugely the sun had not yet heated the cool nightair which lingered among the underbrush and they plunged through the dense portions of the thicket as if the very contact of the foliage was a luxury  the oddlyshaped leaves unfamiliar trees and wirelike grass claimed their attention for fully half an hour to the exclusion of everything else and it is barely possible that the purpose for which they landed might have been forgotten if jim had not reminded them of the fact by saying  look here fellers it wont do for us to caper round here much longer cause bobll be hoppin mad if we aint back soon to tell him whether theres a supply of water well have plenty chances to come ashore before the sea bird is repaired an to steer clear of a row wed better get to work  thus reminded of their duties harry and walter assumed a businesslike air and under the direction of jim set about exploring the key in a methodical manner  before proceeding more than fifty yards straight back from the cove the question of water was settled at the same time that evidences of the men who had done them such grievous injury were found  in the sand amid a thicket of palms was a spring whose clear sparkling water bubbled up apparently through the solid rock forming a tiny stream which flowed toward the east some distance and was then lost amid the dazzling sand near by the underbrush had been trampled down while a quantity of embers told unmistakably that here the three men had camped several days  they wasnt very near starvin if this was where they hung out jim said as he lifted from amid the foliage a small sack of yams and another halffilled with shipsbiscuit heres enough to keep em alive longern they had any right to live an by the looks of them oystershells i should think it had been a reglar thanksgivin day with em  all three ate as if they were hungry when they came aboard the brig harry suggested  that was to throw dust into bobs eyes anyhow these bags show as how the villains werent left here by accident if we could know all about the crowd i reckon wed think ourselves lucky in gettin rid of them with only the loss of the brig  the thought of how they were tricked was one harry did not care to entertain very long just at this time when he had succeeded in partially banishing his great grief and as a means of checking such conversation he said  i suppose we ought to go back and tell bob there is plenty of water here  weve got time enough for that lets look round a little more for id like to find out where them oysters came from jim replied and walter started at once through the thicket as if eager to hide from view this very unpleasant reminder of their enemies  it wont take long to walk across the key jim said as he followed close behind the leader an if we keep straight ahead theres no chance of gettin lost  we can go on for awhile at any rate harry replied and if the distance is too great theres nothing to prevent us from turning around  illustration harry sprung forward with a shout as he pointed to a small dark objectsee page 155  it was destined however that they should not penetrate very far into the interior of the island walter had led the party little more than a quarter of a mile when he halted in front of a veritable hut in the midst of a palmetto thicket  just for an instant the boys believed the key was inhabited but as they pushed further among the luxuriant vegetation that question was settled at least so far as this particular building was concerned it had originally been a rude affair about ten feet square and evidently built from the fragments of a vessel but was now little more than a pile of timbers one end and part of a side yet remained standing the balance thrown down as if decay rather than man or the fury of the elements had caused the collapse  the boys walked around it trying to peer under the rotten planks in the hope of seeing some evidences of its former occupancy until walter said impatiently  theres nothing here worth looking at so lets go on  wait a bit jim replied as he began overhauling the ruins if we could find two or three sound planks bob would think wed made a fair days work cause he needs a good deal of lumber  harry had not thought it possible the discovery could be of any value until this suggestion of jims and then he worked with a will among the ruins knowing full well how delighted the old sailor would be with two or three stout timbers  it seemed hardly probable any very useful material could be gathered from the pile of rubbish for that portion of the hut yet standing was in such a condition of decay that as the fragments inside were removed it came tumbling down with a crash sending the centipedes and other crawling things scuttling away in every direction while the dust rose in dense clouds which caused the boys to sneeze as if a huge snuffbox had been overturned  according to the looks of that we shant find very many serviceable pieces walter said when it was possible to speak again this stuff is so rotten that it wouldnt even make good fuel  i reckon youre right and as he spoke jim pulled toward him the cornerpost which had broken off close to the sand  in dragging it out the wood crumbled to pieces and harry who was a few feet away sprung forward with a shout as he pointed to a small dark object amid the fragments  look at that theres something hidden in the timber  pressing forward the boys saw a square black mass five inches long four wide and a trifle more than one inch in thickness which was lying apparently in the very heart of the wood the briefest examination revealed the fact that the oddlooking thing was in a cavity or recess which had been cut in the timber at what must have been about four feet from the ground when the post formed a portion of the hut it had been most skillfully done and concealed from view by a thin piece of wood rabbetedin so neatly as to make it appear like the solid post even now after so many years must have elapsed it was difficult to see the joints therefore when first done one would have looked in vain for marks of a tool on the timber  what is it jim cried excitedly as he gazed at the black object but made no move toward taking it from the recess where it had so long remained hidden  its something valuable or it wouldnt have been put away like that prhaps a pirate has left it for safekeeping and couldnt get back after it harry suggested  he couldnt have been any very great shakes of a pirate if thats all he had to hide jim said with a tone of contempt for the possibly bloodthirsty owner of the package which he now lifted from its wooden case  the boys gathered close around but the most minute examination failed to reveal anything more valuable than a mass of tar  there must be something inside walter cried excitedly for no one would have taken so much trouble to put such stuff away cut it open  jim was soon chopping at the black mass with his pocketknife and but a few strokes were necessary to show that the tar simply covered a cunninglyplaited network of stout cord fashioned somewhat like an envelope  be careful when you stick the knife through harry cried warningly there must be something precious inside sure  jim did not intend to run any risk of ruining the contents by a hasty stroke after scraping the tar off sufficiently to expose the cords straight across both ends he cut them carefully apart until the envelope was divided like an open wallet exposing to view two thin sheets of wood  its nothing but paper walter exclaimed in a tone of most intense disappointment as jim separated this inner covering showing what appeared to be the attempt of some amateur to draw a diagram on a soiled piece of stout paper  at the top of the sheet which was yellow and timeworn were two lines as follows       xli fathoms n n e from this timber to palmetto tree       xii fathoms s e by e to coralhead  this information if such it could be called was jotted down in fanciful letters instead of writing and immediately beneath it appeared the rude drawing of a hut a crooked tree and a rock or piece of coral from one to the other arrows were placed to mark the probable direction as given above while below was what looked like a representation of an island or key  then was written in angular penmanship the following       we solemnly swear not to disturb the treasure buried by us this      day except in the presence of all the owners or after      receiving proof that one or more are dead      signed       barth meadows              his       pedro  x  gonzales            mark        e bonn              his       josef  x  harttman            mark  for several moments after harry ceased reading this singular document the boys stood staring at the faded characters in silence and then jim exclaimed  ill bet them was pirates what wrote that an if we could only make out what it means thered be a big pile of gold found lets go on board an show it to bob  the mere suggestion that they had the clew to a buried treasure was sufficient to throw all three into a perfect fever of excitement and after carefully gathering up the coverings they started at full speed for the shore shouting to each other as they ran the most improbable theories concerning the ancient document and its signers until the key resounded with their cries  perhaps the men who ran away with the brig belong to the same gang who hid the paper walter suggested in a tremulous tone glancing behind him every few moments as if fancying they might be pursued  that couldnt be harry replied panting because of the rapid pace unless theyve taken the gold with them  for an instant the boys joy decreased very materially and then grew strong once more as jim said confidently  if they had wed seen somethin of it but them duffers didnt have any baggage when they come aboard the bonita wouldnt a left the cove so quick if the men had known about this i tell you fellers it was lucky for us that they stole the brig  illustration facsimile of paper found by the boyssee page 157  then as if unable longer to act like rational beings the explorers burst into loud incoherent shouts which sadly lessened their speed because of the extra amount of breath required to continue the outcries  it was this uproar which joe heard and he and bob were wholly at a loss to understand what had happened as the yawl with her noisy crew approached the tug     chapter xix  an unexpected visit   it was fully ten minutes after the excited boys arrived at the sea bird before bob and joe could understand the meaning of the document which harry waved so triumphantly above his head or learn where and how it had been found each one insisted on telling the story at the same time and the result was that nothing could be distinctly heard until bob shouted  hold up lads give yourselves time to elect a president who can do the talkin an then prhaps me an joell find out whether youve seen the bonita or discovered a bridge that leads to new york  let harry tell the story while walt an me bail the yawl her seams havent swelled enough yet to prevent her from takin in water and jim went forward resolving not to say another word until the matter was fully explained but before harry had well begun the recital both he and walter were assisting in the conversation  bob and joe did finally succeed in learning all the particulars regarding the finding of the manuscript and then their excitement equaled that of the boys  there aint any question but what the lads have lighted on the secret of a pirates treasure the old sailor said in a positive tone and looking around at his companions as if challenging either of them to contradict him years ago these keys used to be a great place for em to sneak in an out of an it stands to reason this would a been jes the kind of a harbor theyd try to make cause theres water enough here to float a goodsized craft  but its a big question as to whether we can find it and joe examined the document carefully once more it has been a good while since this was written and perhaps both the tree and the coral rock have disappeared  it wont take very long to learn that matey bob replied in a tone so cheery that it would have been difficult to believe he had felt so angry and despondent a few hours previous theres a good compass in the pilothouse an with it an your tapemeasure well be able to lay out the course to a hair  do you mean to knock off work for the sake of going treasurehunting joe asked in mild surprise  why not two or three days wont make much difference to us when the repairs are a question of weeks an theres no great danger of an easterly gale at this time of year  it did not require any lengthy or able argument to convince joe that he would be warranted in ceasing his work as machinist to become a treasureseeker for he was fully as eager as bob to test the truth of the apparent statement contained in the document  half an hour after the boys came on board all hands were ready for a return to the key the compass had been placed in the sternsheets of the yawl joe carried the measuringtape in his pocket and all was in readiness for the start when the old sailor suggested that one of the sea birds anchors be dropped  i aint afraid of her slippin the bonitas hawser he said but itll be a good idea to prevent her from swinging round into shoal water  anything no matter how much labor it might involve which would guard against a loss or further disablement of their second and only remaining craft should be attended to and all hands assisted in the work the tugs smallest anchor was let go with the cable made fast to the stern bitt and unless a violent storm should arise she would lay to her moorings as safely as if in a drydock  bob looked once more to the stopper on the bow hawser as if the idea of leaving the little steamer even for so short a time made him uneasy regarding her safety and then when about to step over the rail into the yawl he involuntarily glanced seaward  well if that dont take all the wind outer my sails he exclaimed pointing with one hand toward the open ocean as he shaded his eyes with the other an hour ago id a been glad to see sich a sight as that but with the paper the boys found ive kinder lost all hankerin for a chance to leave this key  the remainder of the party were already on board the yawl and it was some seconds before the full meaning of his words could be understood it was harry who first caught a glimpse of that which attracted the old sailors attention and he cried as he clambered over the steamers rail  its a vessel father has sent some one to look for us and now we can go home  i reckon youre wrong there lad bob said as his companions gathered around him all gazing intently at a small schooner which was creeping slowly toward the key from the southeast evidently heading directly for the cove that craft hasnt got american sailors on board by considerable she looks like a fishermanmost likely comin here for turtles whatever she is we must put off goin ashore for a spell  joe quickly brought the compass from the yawl that no evidences of their intended visit ashore should be seen and said as he took up his tools once more  wed better keep right on about our work for in case they are coming here it may look suspicious to see us loafing when the steamer is so nearly a wreck  but for the document found by the boys joe would not have had such a thought now however the possibility that there might be a large amount of treasure secreted on the key made him overcautious and distrustful  bob returned to the cabin for the curse of wealth had also begun to make itself felt on him and the three boys watched the approach of the stranger but far less eagerly than would have been the case a few hours previous  slowly the schooner drew nearer still heading directly for the cove and shortening sail only when she was inside the outer point of land  come on deck bob joe said in a low tone shes got just about way enough on to fetch us and theres no question but that shes coming to anchor close alongside  bob emerged from the companionway as the schooner swung around to her cable and a man who was standing near the wheel shouted  steamer ahoy  halloo bob replied  whats the matter are you in distress  not exactly weve been at the wrong end of a collision an put in here to patch up a little  have you been ashore yet  do you suppose they know we found the paper walter whispered in alarm as bob hesitated before saying  three of the crew landed this morning to look for water  did you see any men there  if you mean a mexican a thin feller an one with a red nose weve seen moren we wanted and by the tone of bobs voice it could be easily understood that he was growing very angry  thats the crowd were looking for the man on the schooner said excitedly on what part of the key are they  youll find em somewhere between here an the coast of the united states we had the brig bonita in tow when we came to anchor an by lockin us below on the tug they stole her  the man conversed with those near him for a moment and then resumed the conversation by asking  when did that happen  about two hours before sunset yesterday afternoon do you know anything of the scoundrels  considerable that aint to their credit they shipped at nassau on a tradingvessel and tried to get up a mutiny in order to seize the craft the captain marooned them here and we shouldnt have troubled our heads about such a lot if it had not been learned that they murdered two turtlefishers in the northwest channel three weeks ago simply for the small amount of money the men received from sale of the cargo it looks now as if the villains had given us the slip  i aint so sure of that bob replied after some thought the brig is a decently heavy sailer an there hasnt been wind enough to take her very far away the chances are theyre loafin round the bank now  as may be supposed the crew of the sea bird were astonished at learning the true character of those whom they would have befriended that the men were scoundrels there had been good proof but to learn they were murderers as well shocked all hands  its a good thing we didnt sail on the bonita walter said in a whisper if theyd kill two fishermen for a little money im sure there wouldnt have been much hesitation about butchering us before we arrived in port so they could claim the brig  all that appears unfortunate is not illluck joe added and then the captain of the schooner shouted  well give them a chase anyhow tell us the full particulars concerning the brig and if we dont succeed in catching the murderers it will be easy to send the information to every port theyre likely to enter by that means theyll be prevented from enjoying the stolen property very long come aboard where we can talk without such a waste of wind  lets all hands go bob suggested and in a few moments the crew of the sea bird were on the schoonerharry telling the story of how he walter and jim were carried away by the bonita bob relating the particulars of the trade winds loss and joe giving an account of the collision  its kind of a mixed up affair the captain said rubbing his nose vigorously as if to quicken memory and i reckon itll be safer to take down all the names sos therell be no mistake  ill write out the whole thing for you harry proposed and the captain appeared to be relieved by the proposition  i aint got much of a fist for writin he replied halfapologetically an itll save me a deal of time then as harry began what of necessity would be quite a lengthy narrative he asked bob is there anything we can do for you have you stores enough for a decently long voyage  i reckon we have everything needful except coal an well have to run into nassau for that if youll give me the course itll be a big help seeins how i aint very much of a navigator  this the captain was not only willing but pleased to do he even went so far as to draw on a piece of brown paper a rude chart of the northeast providence channel and the self imposed task was hardly completed when harry brought his written story to an end     chapter xx  treasureseekers   the crew of the schooner obtained the fullest particulars regarding the brig the direction of the wind when she was gotten under way and such other information as might be of benefit to them for the chase was to be continued to the american coast if necessary  we can send for the legal papers in case the murderers have reached the united states the captain of the schooner said and with such proof as we have got concerning their crime there is little doubt but that the government will grant an extradition  if you should catch them make a claim in our name for salvage on the brig joe said we brought her through a gale in which she would have been dismasted if not totally wrecked and as she was stolen from an anchorage our rights in the matter should be respected  thats about the size of it joe bob added approvingly if theres any fairness in law we oughter get a right tidy lot of money outer the old hooker  ill attend to the business for you my hearties an whats more them villains shall be made to answer for a coldblooded murder if we have to keep the chase up six months now i allow we should get under way for a good sailin breeze mustnt be lost well see you in nassau i reckon for if things work favorably well be home again in a week at the latest  this was a decided hint for the visitors to take their departure and a few moments later they were rowing toward the sea bird as the schooner glided swiftly out of the little cove  well lads bob said after they had watched the rapidly receding craft until her hull was shut out from view by the point of land now that theyre off theres nothin to prevent us from findin out if what was writ down on that paper means anything get the compass well take an ax an the fireshovel as well for most likely therell be a job at diggin before itll be possible to tell whether were on a wildgoose chase or not  the boys were eager to follow up the clew given by the document found at the ruined hut and in a very short space of time everything was ready once more for a visit to the key  it was now past noon for the schooner had been in the harbor two or three hours but in the excitement of hunting for treasure no one thought of eating the heat was intense even where the seabreeze had full range and among the underbrush it would be almost stifling but this discomfort was unheeded in the newborn thirst for gold  with bob and joe at the oars the yawl glided over the glassy waters very swiftly and when she was pulled up on the sand beyond reach of the tide the old sailor said as he raised the compass  lead the way lads an make the course pretty nigh direct for we dont want to cruise round any moren is necessary joe you take the shovel an ax sos the leaders can travel light  by following up their own trail which was distinctly marked in the underbrush the boys had no difficulty in going directly to the ruined hut stopping only once on the way to quench their thirst at the spring  this is the place an theres the hole in the timber where we found the paper harry said as he laid his hand on the crumbling joist what puzzles me is to know from which side of it were to measure fortyone fathoms  there cant be much of a mistake if were to travel nornoreast and bob placed the compass on that portion of the shattered timber which yet remained in the sand itll be a decently hard job to walk in a straight line though an if we should happen to get an inch or so out of the way at the start it would throw the whole course askew  a few feet wouldnt matter a great deal while weve got the palmetto to guide us joe suggested  we have if its standin yet but this ere document was fixed up a good while ago my hearty an the tree they took their bearins from may have been blowed down a dozen times since then  i dont believe that could have happened more than once harry said laughingly unless palmettoes are different from other trees  well bob replied gravely once would be enough to knock us out of reckoning an instead of standin here in the hot sun chatterin like a lot of parrots wed better find the true course  to lay out a straight line through the woods with nothing but a compass as guide is by no means a simple task and of this the old sailor was well aware he set about the work methodically heeding not the time spent providing the result arrived at was correct and in doing this the assistance of all was necessary  with the compass placed squarely over the end of the post bob sighted across it directing jim who had moved off at a distance of half a dozen yards until he was in the desired position then the compass was carried forward to this point and as joe trimmed away the branches or hewed down trees which obstructed the view harry walked ahead according to the old sailors orders  walter made the third point in the observation and thus the line was continued by the one in the rear going forward when the distance had been measured until fortyone fathoms or two hundred and fortysix feet had been covered  here we are joe cried as the final living peg was in position and theres nothing that looks like a palmetto anywhere near are you sure the course is true  i know it cant be half a fathom out of the way bob said as he wiped the perspiration from his face and gazed around in perplexity this is what comes of takin a bearin thats likely to be knocked outer line  if the tree isnt where it ought to be must we give up the search walter asked as a look of disappointment came over his face  we wont cry quits quite so soon as this bob replied quickly joe drive a stake where harry stands so we can find the spot agin an then get ready to start on the other course  when this had been done bob brought the compass forward once more and joe struck out southeast by easta direction which caused them to return almost over the same course the stake standing at the point of an acute angle  this second course was but little more than onequarter the distance of the first but the underbrush was more tangled which made the labor of clearing a path proportionately greater and it was nearly nightfall when joe shouted as he pressed on in advance  theres no need of squinting across that compassbox any longer for heres the coralhead as plain as the nose on a mans face  without thinking that by leaving their positions all this last portion of the work might have to be repeated the boys rushed forward eagerly despite bobs warning shouts and thus deserted by his assistants the old sailor could do no less than join the others who were standing around what looked like a dullwhite rock of the same form as that so rudely pictured on the timestained paper  i reckon weve struck it he said with a longdrawn sigh of relief but theres likely to be a big lot of diggin an its gettin late my idee is that wed better knock off now an come back in the mornin  joe was of the same opinion and the two men began to gather up their belongings preparatory to a return to the steamer  the boys were decidedly disappointed even though all were very hungry they would have preferred to settle the question then and there regardless of the amount of time that might be necessary but as their views on the subject were not asked for there was no other course open save to follow the leaders  the coralhead lay nearer the waters edge than did the hut and after blazing two or three trees and ascertaining the bearings of the supposed treasure the line of march was taken up  the sun had been below the horizon fully a quarter of an hour when they stepped on board the sea bird and not until then did the boys realize how tired they were the exertion even of cooking supper seemed too great but it was a task which must be performed and all hands aided in it thus bringing the meal to a much earlier close than if jim had officiated at the stove alone  it is safe to say that none of the steamers crew were troubled with wakefulness five minutes after retiring and bob himself was wrapped in slumber when the sun came up out of the sea his eyes were opened at a reasonably early hour however and when a hurried breakfast had been eaten the party set out for the spot where all believed a pirates treasure would be found  to retrace their steps by the course laid out on the previous evening was not a difficult matter for the trail through the tangled underbrush would have showed the way even without the compass and before two hours of this new day were spent the little party stood once more around the coralhead  owing to the fact that they had but one shovel the work of digging progressed slowly and it was soon discovered that the task would require considerable time the coral was of great size very much larger at the base than the top and imbedded in the sand to the depth of at least four feet  we must spell each other every five minutes bob said as he set the example by taking the tool from joes hands in that way we shall get along faster because the one whos diggin will always be fresh  each of the party including the boys had taken his turn at the shovel half a dozen times when the huge mass of coral was finally uncovered and then came the question of removing it entirely  to this end joe cut three poles to be used as levers and with the most intense excitement depicted on every countenance the treasureseekers set about this last portion of the task  the second attempt was successful the coral was rolled up on the sand until it could be toppled over and then as bob scraped the earth away from where it had rested so long an oblong sheet of metalapparently copperwas exposed to view  this was sufficient proof for the boys that the paper found in the hollow log referred to a hoard of gold and they cheered again and again until all three were hoarse while bob said in a tone of mingled amazement and joy  im blest if i thought the dockerment was anything moren a bloomin hoax but this begins to look as if there might be a heap of truth in it even if them as wrote the story was mighty bad hands with a pen  despite all their anxiety to know what had been hidden in this place the little party stood around the excavation in a frame of mind very much resembling awe until joe said impatiently  come come whats the sense of standing like images lets know what there is here now that were pretty near the end of the puzzle  this was sufficient to awaken the treasureseekers from their daze and the work was continued without further delay     chapter xxi  the treasure   the sheet of metal which was about eight feet square and half an inch in thickness covered considerable more space than had the base of the coralhead consequently it became necessary to work some time longer with the shovel before it could be raised  after the edges were exposed and the sand had been thrown back to prevent any chance of its falling in and burying whatever might be beneath when the metal was removed bob said in a tone of caution curbing his own excitement as much as possible  keep cool lads for too great speed jes now may make no end of extra work joe you take hold of this ere plate with me while jim stands by with the shovel in case we start the sand a runnin dont let your hopes climb so high that youll be disappointed if we fail to find anything here my hearties for theres a good many chances somebody has been at this place ahead of us an well have all our labor for nothin calm down sames i am an then there wont be any harm done if we find nothin but an empty hole  bobs advice was good but he did not follow it himself now they were so near the end of the task he was actually trembling with suppressed excitement and it was as if he had made this long speech for the purpose of quieting his own nerves  the boys stood around the excavation awaiting impatiently the moment when the secret was to be revealed and although jim held the shovel ready to check any flow of sand it was apparent that he paid more heed to what might be under the metal plate than the duty assigned him  to raise the heavy covering was more difficult than the old sailor at first supposed four times did he and joe make the attempt unsuccessfully and then as every muscle was strained to the utmost it canted on edge while five pairs of eyes peered eagerly into what was naturally supposed to be an excavation  if the anxious ones had expected an immediate view of treasure they were disappointed a mass of what appeared to be canvas but so discolored and decayed as to require a close scrutiny before such fact could be determined was all that could be seen and this in itself cheered bob wonderfully  whatever was buried is still here for if anybody had got at it they wouldnt a taken the trouble to cover the hole over again all hands turn to an lift this chunk of metal out of the way  an dont be two or three hours about it either jim cried impatiently as he grasped one side of the huge plate or well never find out whats under the canvas  the additional excitement lent strength to every arm and as if it had been nothing more than a piece of wood the heavy mass was rolled end over end until it lay on the sand a dozen feet from the excavation  when this had been done there was no longer any delay in continuing the investigation with one accord every member of the party seized at the same moment the discolored covering which hid from view the secret of the key the fabric crumbled in their hands like tinder and instead of lifting it off readily each pulled up a small quantity of moldering fiber  take the shovel bob cried excitedly to joe this stuff hasnt got much more substance than dust an it must be scraped away carefully  its a bad lookout for what may be beneath joe replied grimly as he obeyed the order while the boys and bob worked with their hands until a black stiff surface was exposed  this is tarred canvas an by gettin hold of the edges we can lift it out i reckon the old sailor said and as the others followed his example the second covering together with the remaining fragments of the first was raised without difficulty exposing to view a sight well calculated to increase the already feverish excitement  an excavation about five feet square dug down to the bedrock and lined on the sides with tarred canvas was revealed while in it packed with a view to economy of space were a large number of small black bags full to plumpness of something which bulged here and there like metal  bob drew his sheathknife in a twinkling and instead of cutting the mouth of a bag which he lifted from its long restingplace slit it down the side allowing the contents to drop in a dull yellow shower on the sand  talk about wantin salvage on the brig he cried why heres more money than she and her cargo would fetch in any port its gold lads heres a spanish doubloon this is an english sovereign an theres a dutch piece it would puzzle a lawyer to count it offhand but we oughter be satisfied at knowin that every coin is good lawful money no matter how them as put their fists to the dockerment may a got it  bob was almost beside himself with joy and the others were not one whit more calm each had torn or cut open a bag and was handling the contents as if every touch of the precious metal gave pleasure that the hoard was valuable every member of the party knew beyond a doubt even though no one could compute the actual amount there were coins of almost every nation some of gold others of silver all poured into the tarred canvas bags without any attempt at classification but simply that they might be in a portable shape  the bag harry opened contained in addition to the money several rings but in the excitement of the moment there was no thought of examining them critically it was sufficient that they were in possession of a large amount of treasure the value of the find was a secondary consideration just then  the old sailor finally aroused himself from what can be called by no other name than a delirium of joy and with his awakening to the reality came that which the accumulation of wealth always bringsfear lest it should be lost as suddenly as it was gained  we mustnt sit here crowin like idiots he cried sharply as he began to gather up the goldpieces which had fallen on the ground theres no tellin how soon somebody may come an if we want to hold what weve got its time things around here were put into shape these bags must be carried on board the sea bird an the hole filled in agin sos no one will know weve been diggin  this suggestion started the remainder of the party into activity and on the instant all were ready to set about the necessary work  it was now high noon the rays of the sun beat down upon the sand with a heat that under any other circumstances would have seemed overpowering but the treasurefinders heeded it not the foliage shut out every breath of air and the shadows cast by the trees were but so many stifling spots free only from the glare of the sand yet no one hesitated to begin the laborious task because the burdens were golden over all had come the fear that this newfound treasure might be wrested from them and hunger or thirst fatigue or exhaustion were alike forgotten  a couple of bags are as much as joe an me can carry while one will be a load for you boys but in three turns well have them all at the boat so lets get under way at once bob said as he set the example while the others obeyed silently  no one speculated as to why so much gold had been buried in that particular spot or how it happened that those who concealed the treasure had abandoned the rich hoard the wonderful fact of its having come into their possession was the only thought which could be entertained  the burdens as allotted by bob were reasonably heavy and despite the excitement which lent fictitious strength the journey to the boat occupied considerably more than half an hour  joe and bob scanned the horizon in every direction before depositing the first load of treasure to return for the second but as no sail was in sight on the dazzling blue waters it was believed safe to leave the precious bags on the beach during the hour they would necessarily be absent  on the third trip neither harry nor walter carried a load there were originally but nineteen packages in the excavation as was shown by careful count and since the two boys showed more signs of weariness than the others bob insisted that both travel emptyhanded  when the tired party arrived at the beach with the last of the gold the boat was launched the bags distributed evenly fore and aft and with joe and bob rowing the return to the steamer was begun  the movement of the yawl caused a light breeze which greatly refreshed the heated treasureseekers and with the relief thus afforded came speculation as to why so much wealth had been concealed on the key  i reckon them as signed that ere dockerment were reglar pirates bob said in reply to a question from harry it aint likely honest folks would a put the stuff there when it could easier have been carried somewhere else  but why did they leave it harry persisted from the looks of the hut its been a good many years since anybody lived there and of course the gold was buried when that was built  most likely the whole crowd are deadkilled in a fightor we wouldnt a hit on sich a find howsomever it dont make much difference to us seein that weve got the pile look lively when we reach the steamer lads an put the bags aboard in a hurry for theres another trip ashore to be made before sunset  what for jim asked in surprise  we must cover that hole up as it was when we found it sos in case anybody stumbles over the place before the sea bird is ready to leave there wont be any suspicion as to what has been taken out joe an me will tend to that part of it while you boys cook dinner  by this time the yawl was close alongside the steamer jim was in the bow and as the rowers held her steady he leaped aboard with the painter  in accordance with bobs orders harry and walter clambered over the steamers rail and stood ready to take the bags as they were passed up  stow em in the hold behind the watercasks the old sailor said when the last valuable package was on board an see to that part of it before doin anything else  then he and joe rowed slowly back to the shore while the boys carried the treasure below  it was difficult for them to realize even though they had such good proof that all this weight was made up of gold coin and jim who was more boisterous than any other member of that highly excited crew insisted on opening every bag before stowing it away  there was nothing to interfere with such diversion for bob and joe would necessarily be absent a long while and each package was duly inspected  harry wanted to count the money in one bag in order to get some idea of the total amount but he was forced to abandon the task after a few moments work there were apparently coins of every nation the majority of which the boys could only make a rough guess as to the value and jim said when harry announced his inability to arrive at even an approximate computation  never mind fellers we can weigh the whole lot when we get into port an then figger up somewhere near what its worth id jes like to spread these all over the deck where we could see em every minute but i spose bob would kick  hed have good reason harry said laughingly besides bein in the way it wouldnt be safe to have so much gold around for theres no knowing how soon some other craft may come into the cove  all the same id like to see it on deck jim replied and then as if it required a mighty effort to put this desire far from him he bustled to and fro in the most energetic fashion  after this work had been done the amateur cook and his assistants went into the galley where all the stores were overhauled in order that a most elaborate meal might be prepared for despite the heat and his fatigue jim was determined to make of the dinner a regular thanksgiving feast to celebrate their rare good fortune     chapter xxii  from joy to dismay   it was nearly sunset and jims feast had been ready for the table fully an hour when bob and joe came out of the thicket and launched the boat once more  the boys who were on deck watching for their return could see that both the men were nearly exhausted they rowed as if it was a great exertion even to lift the oars and on reaching the steamer sat in the yawl some time before coming aboard  youd better hurry jim said warningly ive had a swell dinner ready so long that it must be pretty nigh dried up by this time an if you fool round much more everything will taste like chips  i couldnt hurry lad if a months grub rolled together was waitin for me bob said as he mopped his sunburned face with his shirtsleeve that last job was a tough one an i feel as though all the marrow in my bones was toasted brown this eres the only shady place with any air stirrin weve found since mornin an i mean to scoop in all the comfort i can for the next halfhour  joe was equally as unwilling to move from the side of the tug where slight but cooling draughts of air afforded the longneeded relief from intense heat and jims feast was but little more than a cold lunch when the weary ones were ready to sit at the table in the stuffy cabin  bob exerted himself but once more that night after the meal was finished and then he went below to make sure the treasure had been stowed according to his directions  it was yet light when the tired crew stretched themselves on the mattresses which had been spread under the awning aft and although there was such a fruitful topic but little conversation was indulged in because slumber came so quickly  but however tired jim was he could not refrain from speaking of the treasure they had so unexpectedly found  what are you fellers goin to do with your share of the gold he asked in a low tone to avoid being overheard by joe or bob  give it to father i suppose harry replied displaying but little enthusiasm because of his weariness  you can bet ill keep what comes to me right in my own trouserspocket master libby replied very decidedly im goin to buy a vessel like the mary walker an make a voyage fishin all by myself  but youll have to take a crew walter suggested with a yawn  of course ill have somebody to do the work an stand watch but ill be the boss an wont so much as go on deck when it rains ill have a heavinline in my pocket sos to whale the cook if the grub aint firstclass i tell you the crewll have to jump round when im aboard or therell be fun  i should think you had enough of that kind of work when those men were aboard harry said after a pause  well you see i want to take my turn at floggin once in a while sos to know what its like i havent had a chance yet but i will when we get this money home  neither harry nor walter made any reply to this rather cruel project and in the silence which followed they soon fell asleep leaving jim his choice of indulging in more aircastles or that of benefiting by their example  the first rays of the rising sun failed to awaken them next morning and all hands might have slept a good portion of the forenoon if jim had not been aroused by a sensation of numbness in his arm caused by the fact that harry had unconsciously used it as a pillow  its early yet an i reckon id better take one more nap instead of callin the other fellers he muttered to himself as he sat bolt upright an instant for the purpose of restoring the circulation of blood to his misused limb  as he did this however mechanically glancing seaward he saw that which drove from his eyelids all desire for sleep  a boat had just come into view from around the northern point of the cove and was heading directly toward the steamer rowed by two men who looked strangely familiar although for a moment he could not clearly distinguish their features  bob bob he cried in a low tone as he shook the unconscious sailor theres a yawl comin in here an i believe  he did not finish the sentence for joe was on his feet by this time and cried before jim could speak another word  im a dutchman if that rednosed villain an the mexican havent come back what deviltry are they up to i wonder  now the remainder of the crew were awake and peering out over the rail at the rapidlyapproaching boat the occupants of which could be clearly distinguished as two of the party for whom those on the schooner from nassau were in search  what are we to do joe asked in a whisper they mustnt be allowed to come on board or we may have trouble in getting rid of them and besides i dont fancy being shipmates with murderers  of course they cant come over the rail bob replied angrily bring anything on deck that will serve in the place of weapons an well keep them at a distance its only two against twowithout countin the boysan i reckon we can hold our own  just as joe disappeared inside the engineroom the newcomers having arrived within thirty or forty yards of the steamer ceased rowing as he with the red nose shouted  ahoy on the tug  what do you want bob asked gruffly  weve come to make a trade the brig is aground on the shoal to the norard of here an things shall be made fair an square if youll help us float her ill come aboard where we can talk comfortablelike  thats exactly what you wont do while ive got strength enough to break your head  now dont get grumpy over the little trick we played the man said in a wheedling tone  do you call it nothin but a trick to steal a vessel an leave five of us on a disabled tug after wed done what we could to keep you from starvin bob shouted fiercely  we knew there was plenty of grub aboard you couldnt a handled both crafts so what we did was only dividin things up the bonita is stranded now an will go to pieces in the first gale if you cant fix the tug to tow her off well  the steamer couldnt be repaired in a month but if she was in workin order we wouldnt raise a hand toward savin the brig while you were on board  as bob ceased speaking joe came on deck with four lengths of iron pipe each about three feet long and the old sailor seized one of these with a look of exultation as he said to his companions  i reckon they wont get over the rail while we can swing sich a handy club as this  they may have firearms joe suggested  that aint very likely or theyd a set us ashore ten minutes after we took em off the key  during this short conversation the two men were whispering together and as the old sailor ceased speaking he with the red nose cried in a threatening tone  you sealawyers want to be mighty careful with your tongues or therell be trouble ive come here to make a fair trade an youd better listen to it well help repair the tug an give up an equal share of the brig if youll turn to with us an get her off the shoal  we wouldnt lift a finger if she was sinking with all three of you on board joe shouted unable to remain silent any longer theres been a schooner up here from nassau since that trick as you call it was played on us and if her crew ever get hold of your crowd it wont make any difference whether the bonita goes to pieces or floats  for an instant the two men sat motionless and silent staring at the engineer as if stupefied by the information and then the one with the red nose cried hoarsely as he shook his fist in impotent rage  we was willin to give you a fair show an do our share toward repairin the steamer but if that cant be done look out for squalls well pull the brig off the shoals and whats more it will be done with that steamer  come an take her bob cried derisively youve got to get rid of us first then repair the machinery an afterwards learn to run it by that time i reckon therell be more gray hairs in your heads than there are now  the angry man looked at the old sailor an instant as if about to make another threat and then evidently changing his mind he spoke a few words to his companion after which the two began to row leisurely toward the shore  the crew of the sea bird watched them in silence until the boats bow grated on the sand and as the men left her to go into the woods joe said  if we worked lively it might be possible to tow that yawl out here before they knew what was being done then those two would be harmless an the one theyve left on the brig wouldnt be able to do much mischief alone  it could be done i spose bob replied thoughtfully but id rather let em go away than stay so near  but we shall have to be on guard all the time for no one knows when theyll make an attempt to steal this steamer  i cant see that we should be as well off to coop em up on the island weve got to take in a supply of water from there before itll be safe to leave the harbor an theyd interfere with sich a job mightily  this was a view of the case which joe had entirely overlooked and it was sufficient to show the folly of his hastilyformed plan  they may try to stave our boat when they come back jim suggested it could be done before wed have a chance to stop em  theres some truth in that lad bob replied quickly it wont do any harm to take her out of the water so jump in an hook on the falls  when the yawl was hoisted inboard all hands seemed to realize that an encounter was extremely probable even though the murderers could gain but little advantage in getting possession of a disabled steamer and they gathered around bob to learn what measures for defence he had to propose  its certain they wont try any game until the other man is here he said after a long pause during which he scrutinized the shore closely an wed better get ready for a fight jim you an harry cook breakfast walter is to go on watch and joe an ill set about the work now that there is so much treasure aboard we must push the repairs for all were worth  when the two cooks went below and the sentry took up his position in the pilothouse bob began making such preparations for defence as were possible with the limited means at his command the pieces of iron pipe were laid near the rail aft where they could be most conveniently reached the boathook and oars were taken from the yawl that they might be ready for use and then the old sailor brought on deck the largest rocks he could find among the ballast  theres about a dozen below thatll weigh ten or fifteen pounds apiece he said grimly in reply to joes question of what he intended to do with such primitive weapons one of em would make some disturbance if it struck a boats plankin below the rail inside an i reckon we can pitch em pretty true if the villains should be foolish enough to make an attack  by the time the steamer had been put in a state of defence jim announced that breakfast was ready and the two men went below while the cook and walter stood guard to give an alarm at the first appearance of the enemy     chapter xxiii  preparations   while it was not possible that those who had stolen the bonita could gain possession of the tug so long as her crew exercised ordinary care nor probable that they would make any very desperate effort to do so in her disabled condition every precaution was taken for the defense of the steamer and the safety of the treasure  immediately after breakfast bob joe and harry went into the hold and the work of stowing the bags among the ballast where it would escape observation was begun  the gravel and rocks were first dug away until the keelson was exposed and on this timber the gold was packed after which everything was replaced as before leaving the bags buried to the depth of six or eight inches the hoard was thus hidden so securely that there was little chance that it would be found unless the searchers had positive information of its being on board  this work was hardly finished when walter came below with the information that the two men were leaving the key and bob and joe hurried on deck for it was by no means certain some demonstrations against the steamer would not be made  in this however they were happily mistaken neither he with the red nose nor the mexican had any idea of trusting their precious bodies within reach of possible harm but they stopped the boat fifty or sixty yards away while the leader shouted  do you still say that you wont lift a hand toward helpin the brig off the shoal  theres nothin were able to do bob replied the tug is as useless as a raft an itll be three weeks at the very soonest before the screw can be turned im willin though to say we wouldnt help you if we could so its no use to do any chinnin  the rednosed man appeared to think that some vent for his anger was absolutely necessary and he catered to this feeling by shaking his fist threateningly after which the two rowed out of the cove  i dont reckon them kind of monkeyshines will do us much harm bob said philosophically as he walked slowly aft to where joe had recommenced his long task of repairing the engine as if time was too precious to be wasted on such villains as those in the boat  if theyre wise we shant see so much as their noses again the engineer said this craft wouldnt be of any service if we should offer to give her up and the scoundrels ought to be in too much of a hurry to leave the vicinity where the schooner from nassau may put in at any moment to waste much time on spitework  i reckon youre about right but at the same time it stands us in hand to be ready if they should take it into their ugly heads to kick up a row after weve made sure theyre really gone ill take two of the boys ashore an bring off a cask of water its got to be done before we can leave an nows as good a time as any  there was nothing the remainder of the crew could do to help joe however disposed they might be for the task and he made no objection to the plan  the yawl was lowered an empty cask put on board and with harry in the sternsheets bob and jim pulled the little craft out toward the open water until it was possible to see the enemy fully a mile away as they rowed around the key  were all right now bob said after one glance at the two men theres no chance of them villains getting back before we fill the cask so head her for the shore lad  it was a difficult job to get the waterbutt after it had been filled from the spring to the boat and the forenoon was wellnigh spent when the task had been accomplished the only thing in the laborers favor was the fact that the sun no longer sent down such fervent rays upon the parched land at about ten oclock clouds began to gather and had continued to do so until the entire heavens were covered as by a veil much to bobs disquietude  theres more than rain in them lads he said with an ominous shake of the head when they emerged from the thicket with the unwieldy burden if i aint way out of my reckonin well get a capful of wind from the east before mornin an the sea bird stands a slim chance of keepin off the shore  with both anchors down i dont see how any harm can come to her no matter how much of a gale we have harry replied as he gazed toward the trim little steamer which was moored so securely bow and stern  im afeared youll have a chance of seein how it can be done this sandy bottom aint the best holdinground for an anchor an once she begins to drag nothin can stop her howsomever he added in a more cheerful tone we neednt croak till the trouble comes but its best to get aboard lively an make preparations for a dirty night it wont take much of a wind to knock the brig to pieces if shes on the outer edge of the shoal so we can reckon on that rednosed villain an his mates comin ashore about sunset  it was necessary for the rowers to exert all their skill and strength on the oars to prevent the yawl from being swamped during the return to the steamer already had the sea begun to rise and the whitecapped waves which now beat heavily against the shore gave token of what force they would exert when roused to fury by the east wind which was causing the trees to wave helplessly to and fro against the gray sky  the little boat was loaded to the gunwales and despite every effort the green water rushed in over the rail very often much to harrys alarm by pulling around to the starboard bow of the steamer where they would be partially sheltered from both wind and wave it was possible to get the heavy cask on board without mishap after which the yawl was hooked on the falls and hoisted up otherwise she would speedily have been stove to pieces against the larger craft  it looks as if we were to have a bad night joe said when the work was finished and all hands went aft once more  the worst we could have bob replied gloomily the chances are the steamer will be driven ashore and theres no question about those villains leaving the brig so unless this wind takes a different slant before sunset we can count on bein penned up on the island with them as jolly companions but we cant afford to moon round very long tellin whats goin to happen for theres plenty of work to be done the awnin must be taken down an the cables overhauled  then he called for the boys to bear a hand and soon all were busily preparing for what was apparently the inevitable  by the time the deck had been cleared and everything made snug the sea bird was dancing about like a cork flinging the spray fore and aft as she came up on the cables with a thud that caused the timbers to creak or plunging her bow under until the deck was awash  at five oclock in the afternoon the gale was full upon them coming directly out of the east and so furiously did the little craft toss and pitch that bob took the precaution of stretching lifelines fore and aft the cables had been slackened to give plenty of scope but she overrode the bow anchor until one would have fancied from the savage jerks which the steamer gave that it had been hove short  there was no thought of cooking jim could hardly have remained on his feet in the galley for the swell was shorter and more violent than it would have been on the open ocean therefore the anxious ones were forced to eat dry shipsbiscuit with the poor consolation in mind that before morning all their stores might be at the bottom of the sea  the boys were in the pilothouse where they could have a view of all that was going on and yet be in a position to render immediate assistance if it was needed joe and bob remained on deck despite the spray which fell like rain and the former said to the old sailor toward night as he made his way forward after great difficulty  we can get some pleasure out of the fact that the men havent come ashore from the brig theres no chance of their making harbor in the teeth of this wind and we can count on having got rid of them  thats where you make a mistake my hearty they most likely landed two or three hours ago runnin down the western shore where theyd find sheltered water them men aint fools if they are villains an by noon knowed the brig couldnt hold together much longer the chances are she was bilged two hours ago an has gone to pieces by this time  joe went aft again looking more disconsolate than ever he had felt positive the enemy had not abandoned the vessel and his disappointment was all the greater because this hope had been so strong  when the gray light of day gave place to the darkness of night the anchors still held but the steamer was laboring so much on account of the bow hawser that bob decided it would be necessary to shift the strain despite the danger attendant upon such an undertaking  all hands on deck he shouted at the door of the pilothouse adding warningly as the boys crept out keep a firm hold of the lifelines lads for he who falls overboard will stand a poor chance of saving himself  to make the proposed change it was necessary to carry the cable astern after it was cast off the bitt for all the slack had long since been let out and rapidity of movement was as essential as strength  wait till she buries her nose once more an then rush when she rises bob shouted as he threw off two or three turns of the rope  up up the little craft rose as the great green waves swept beneath and then when the hawser chucked her and the fall began the signal was given  all hands with a will now the old sailor shouted and in an instant the crew were rushing madly aft the heavy cable nearly dragging them from their feet  bob had been correct as to the precise time when this maneuver should be executed but he failed to give due consideration to the force the undertow would exert in such shoal water the hawser had but just been loosened from the bitt when the drag of the waters began all hands clung with a force born of desperation but their efforts were vain  a crew of giants could not have resisted the strain upon the wet ironlike rope and bob shouted wildly when he was almost at the taffrail  let go for your lives let go  fortunately this order was obeyed before any one had been injured in the rush and as the hawser disappeared over the stern joe muttered half to himself but so loud that harry could distinguish the words  weve done all we could to wreck the little craft it would have been better to let her labor with the risk of chafing the rope apart rather than deliberately throw one anchor away when two hardly held her     chapter xxiv  ashore   the rain which was now falling in torrents the driving surf and the pitching of the steamer all served to make it difficult to keep ones footing on the slippery planks and jim motioned his companions to follow him into the pilothouse for now that the hawser had been swallowed up by the waves their services were no longer required outside  stay on deck bob cried as he saw them moving away and forced to shout at the full strength of his lungs in order to make himself heard above the roar of the tempest in case she strikes you must be where theres a chance of savin your lives get under the lee of the house forard an hold on for all youre worth  after some considerable difficulty the boys succeeded by working along the lifelines in reaching the bow where partially protected by the pilothouse it was possible to remain in comparative shelter  do you think the tug will be wrecked jim harry asked  i reckon shell drive ashore  then we shall be no better off than if we hadnt found the pirates gold for of course itll all be lost  not unless she goes to pieces jim replied in a decidedly shaky voice and then as if this subject was an unpleasant one he changed it by asking without any idea the question would be answered  whats bob doin aft so long he cant expect to pick up that hawser agin an its more dangerous there than here  hes coming now walter replied as he crept to the corner of the house and at the same instant that a huge wave rolled inboard sweeping the decks with almost irresistible violence the old sailor and joe appeared literally working their way hand over hand by means of the lifeline  arriving under the lee of the pilothouse they halted and waited in silence for the shock which should tell that the sea bird had been forced into shoal water  this unpleasant information was not long delayed the little steamer pitched and plunged more violently than before but without the sickening motion of being dragged under which was apparent when the bow anchor held and after ten minutes of this wild tossing she lurched forward suddenly as if the screw had been set in motion  hold on for your lives bob shouted and a moment later the tug struck heavily with such force that but for the timely warning more than one of the crew would have been hurled forward  all hands waited with bated breath for the succeeding shocks which would tell that she was pounding herself to pieces on the sand but much to their surprise nothing of the kind was felt  the stern anchor is holding her down bob shouted to joe and the words were hardly spoken when the water dashed forward flooding the decks even with the rail  well be drowned here in short order joe cried as he struggled toward the boys get into the pilothouse if you can for the danger is less there while the decks are being swept  fortunately for all hands the door opened at the top of a short flight of stairs above the level of the rail and this the engineer succeeded in opening by watching his opportunity between the heavy waves harry and walter gained this shelter before the sea rushed forward again and at the next interval of comparative quiet the remainder of the party joined them  it was now possible to converse without actually shouting and joe was eager to understand why the tug remained immovable when in the ordinary course of events she should be beating herself to pieces on the shoal  the anchor slipped enough to let her drive ahead a bit bob said in explanation an then brought up just as she struck youll most likely find the hawser taut as an iron bar and that together with the hold the sand has got on her nose keeps everything firm  and if the anchor should give way once more shed break up  theres no doubt about that but ive got an idee the wind hasnt got as much force as it had half an hour ago if the timbers will stand that poundin astern theres a chance of our gettin outer this scrape after all even though things do look so tough  it was but natural that all hands should devote their entire attention to ascertaining if the gale really was abating since this was their only hope and when another halfhour had elapsed the question was decided the seas still beat against the stranded steamer with the same violence but the rain had nearly ceased and the wind no longer howled around the doomed craft with its former fury  when this became an assured fact it was as nearly as bob could judge about midnight and the weary boys thought with dismay of the many hours which must elapse before they could gain a place of absolute safety  lie down and go to sleep if you can the old sailor said much as if he knew of what they were thinking i reckon the worst is over an since its only a question of waitin youd best get all the rest possible  the boys followed this suggestion by curling themselves up on the cushioned locker and strange as it may seem they fell asleep in a very short time despite the howling wind and raging waters weariness of body was greater than fear and even in the midst of deadly dangers they crossed the borders of dreamland  bob and joe kept watch and as the hours wore on the couriers of the coming dawn dispersed the stormclouds until the heavens were smiling blue once more and the waves no longer uplifted their crests in anger  theres as big a danger passed as ever sailormen stood face to face with bob said giving vent to a longdrawn sigh of relief the little craft is hard and fast aground of course but six hours ago it didnt seem as if anything could save her from goin to pieces an this same crowd here have got a mighty big reason for bein thankful  the decks were yet awash and would probably continue so for several hours or until the waters of the tiny harbor had subsided into their former quietude but it was possible to make ones way fore and aft without danger as joe proved when the day had dawned  all the doors and hatches were securely closed when the gale first sprung up therefore everything below was in much the same condition as before the storm there had not water enough entered the seams or crevices to injure the stores and the hull was comparatively free as bob learned on trying the handpump  i dont reckon we can count on leavin this key in the sea bird he said as he dropped the lead over the bow she has stuck her nose mighty deep in the sand an though that cable is strainin hard astern theres little chance it will work her off  and according to your ideas those who stole the bonita are ashore somewhere so as long as were obliged to stay here its safe to say theres a chance of trouble from them  thats about the size of it my hearty but they may take a notion to put to sea for its likely their boat was cared for after comin ashore howsomever we wont look trouble in the face before it comes lets rouse up the boys an get breakfast under way for im growin sharkish  it is needless to make any attempt at depicting the joy of those in the pilothouse when they opened their eyes to see the bright sun smiling and the raging winds subsiding into the gentlest zephyrs that were ever wafted over a coral reef this decided change was so pleasing that despite all the trouble which surrounded them they were very cheerful  jim bustled about in the galley as if cooking was the one delight of his life and while bob and joe raised once more the awning to shelter them from the burning rays of the sun harry and walter did their best toward spreading the breakfasttable in such a manner that it would at least look inviting  the only immediate trouble which might be apprehended was from those who had probably taken refuge on the key and with this they were confronted much sooner than the most timid expected  harry had just come on deck to announce that breakfast was ready when a shout from the shore caused all hands to glance in that direction where could be seen the rednosed man and his companions emerging from the thicket  halloo he shouted in a friendly tone and without replying bob held up his hand in token that the hail had been heard  the brig has gone to pieces an were here with no chance of leavin the key the man continued much as if giving valuable information  wheres the boat you came ashore in one i reckon  yes but she went adrift during the gale  if you couldnt take better care of her theres no reason why you shouldnt stay there till the schooner from nassau puts in here again joe shouted angrily were aground and likely to remain so but thats no reason why there should be any communication between us  will you send us some grub ashore the rednosed man asked after a short pause during which he stood as if trying to control his anger  not so much as a biscuit if you were hungry but that cant be for it isnt likely you put off from the brig without provisions  all right the man cried with a threatening gesture you can do as you please an weve got the same privilege so its a question as to who has the best end of the trade  they thought we might be fools enough to take some grub ashore when all three of em were ready to seize the boat bob said as the men disappeared in the thicket its a case of standin by with our weathereyes liftin for if their yawl has gone adrift theyll try hard to steal ours ill go on watch while the rest of you get breakfast for the water around the bow aint so deep but that they can wade out here and the old sailor seated himself on the starboard rail as joe and the boys went into the forward cabin     chapter xxv  a serious loss   joe stood guard in turn while bob ate his breakfast the boys setting things to rights in the cabin and galley and when the old sailor came on deck again the question of what should be done was discussed  there aint much chance we can do anything toward floating the steamer until after the machinery has been repaired the engineer said by way of beginning the conversation and before that can be done she will have settled so deep in the sand that the screw wont have any effect  thats jes about the way i figger it out bob replied as a troubled look came over his face the cable will stop her from workin ahead but shell keep on settlin jes the same  and if we cant float her theres but one other course to pursue which is to take to the yawl and run our risk of reaching nassau  there aint much risk about it shell carry all hands an the gold without crowdin an as for danger why bless you we can make harbor among these keys almost any hour in the day its abandonin a sound craft like this that makes me sore and bob gave vent to a deep sigh of sorrow or disappointment  but if it must be done the sooner we start the better  youre right joe an it aint any use to whine about what cant be helped if that rascally crew werent ashore we might make one try to float her but as they are there an cant get away very soon wed better go to work if youll find somethin thatll answer for a mast ill cut the steamers foresail into a legomutton sail for the boat an by tomorrow we can make a start  when the boys came on deck they were surprised at seeing the two men engaged in rigging the yawl instead of trying to float the sea bird and after the proposed plan had been explained jim was thoroughly dissatisfied although he took good care not to betray such fact to joe or bob  its just foolishness to abandon this steamer he said to the boys when the three were comparatively alone forward weve lost the brig that would have brought in a big lot of money through the salvage an now were goin to leave the sea bird for them murderers  with the goldpieces weve got in the hold i dont think theres any reason to feel very badly about what might have been made out of the bonita harry said laughingly its a fact that we cant do very much while that crowd on the key stand ready to take every possible advantage and neither walter nor i are sorry to go away in the morning no matter how much must be left behind  dont you care whether the steamer goes to pieces or not jim asked almost angrily  of course wed like to save her if it could be done quickly but we had rather get home than have a dozen tugs just like her and the sooner the yawl is under way the sooner our parents will know where we are  but they must have found out all about it long before this jim said calmly  how could that be  the captain of the schooner promised to report us an your fathers have read the whole story in the papers by this time  but we cant get home any too soon walter said decidedly and the conversation was brought to an abrupt conclusion as jim went sulkily into the galley where a few minutes later a terrible clattering of pots and pans told of his displeasure  there was no slight amount of work to be done before the little party could be ready to abandon the sea bird the journey to nassau might be a long one because of baffling winds and plenty of food must be cooked there were no kegs or small casks aboard consequently it would be necessary to fill all the bottles and cans with water and in addition bob and joe would be occupied a greater portion of the day in rigging the yawl  the uproar in the galley reminded the old sailor that very much should be done in that quarter and the only benefit master jim derived from his outburst of illtemper was such as might be extracted from an order to cook all the grub he could between then and sunset  during the day nothing was seen of the party on the key toward the close of the afternoon a thin thread of smoke which apparently arose from the western shore told they were still there and also that the intimation of a scarcity of food was false  theyve most likely got more provisions than we have bob said as joe called his attention to the smoke its safe to say that the boat was loaded with cabinstores an ill bet a farthings worth of silver spoons they havent lost so much as a biscuit  although we have no reason to sympathize with them in any way im glad to know theyre not hungry joe replied gravely  until half an hour before sunset all hands worked industriously and then the task had been accomplished with the exception of putting the treasure and stores on board the yawl was rigged with as much canvas as could safely be carried in a fair sailing breeze and was made fast alongside ready to receive her cargo when another day should dawn  it wont take half an hour to load bob said in a tone of satisfaction as he scrutinized the result of his labor an well buckle down to stowin away part of what jim has cooked today you take the first watch on deck joe for i dont calculate itll be safe to trust the boys after dark an ill spell you when im through supper  bob had decided that a vigilant watch must be kept during the night although he did not believe the enemy would make any demonstrations and an hour after supper all hands save the engineer turned in on mattresses spread under the awning  at ten oclock joe called the old sailor to his trick on deck and he in turn was aroused at midnight for the watches were only of two hours duration  when joe came on duty the second time all animate objects appeared to be in a state of the most complete repose not a sound could be heard save the musical ripple of waters on the beach or the faint murmur of the nightwind as it sung gently among the foliage  owing to the wakefulness and excitement of the previous night together with the exertions of the day just passed joes eyes were heavy with sleep and in order to shake off the drowsiness which pressed upon him he paced softly to and fro on the port side of the deck  it was unfortunate for the sea birds crew that he chose that particular place for a promenade had he walked on the starboard side of the house it would have been possible to see by the faint sheen of the waters a small round object that apparently floated out from the shore directly toward where the yawl was moored  perhaps it might have aroused his curiosity if not his suspicion and that would have been sufficient to prevent a serious loss  as it was however he continued the promenade bent only on keeping his eyes open and the black sphere came nearer and nearer until one could have distinguished the countenance of the mexican who had assisted in stealing the bonita  slowly but steadily the head advanced causing hardly a ripple on the water until it was hidden in the deep shadow cast by the steamers hull then a hand in which was held an open knife appeared above the surface as its fellow grasped the yawls painter  one quick noiseless stroke and the rope was severed after which the head and hands disappeared  joe continued to pace the deck ignorant of what was taking place so near him and inch by inch the yawl drifted toward the shore until fully threequarters of the distance from the steamer to the key had been traversed when the form of a man rose out of the water which at that particular point was not more than three feet deep and drew her boldly in on the beach  at two oclock the engineer awakened bob to stand what was now a useless watch and half an hour later all hands were startled into wakefulness by his loud cry  the yawl has gone adrift  as they sprung to their feet in alarm he drew in the bit of rope that hung loosely from the rail and after one glance at the severed end said angrily  were nice sailors we are thought the boys couldnt stand watch an took the job ourselves only to have them villains steal the boat from under our noses this rope has been cut so theres no chance she went adrift by accident  joe insisted that he did not close his eyes while on duty and bob was equally certain that he kept vigilant watch therefore there was no possibility of ascertaining when the theft had been committed  the yawl is gone the old sailor said grimly after a long pause an thats all we need to know just now how she went dont make very much difference but id like to have that rednosed man within reach of my fist about three minutes  this last misfortune seemed a most severe one in the boys eyes and for fully a quarter of an hour jim was nearly speechless from excess of indignation and apprehension  it seems like we was never going to get clear of this island he said in a whisper when bob and joe went forward thinking it might be possible to see the stolen boat i believe the pirates gold has something to do with our bad luck an i wish wed never found that letter  i dont see why you should feel out of sorts harry said in a sorrowful tone you were angry because we proposed to abandon the steamer and now that its impossible to get away you ought to be contented  stayin here without a boat to go ashore in is a different thing from bein able to sail anywhere around the key jim replied and then he relapsed into silence once more  the conversation between bob and joe was no more satisfactory than that carried on by the boys as a matter of course they had not been able to see the boat which was now completely hidden in the shadow of the trees and after straining their eyes in vain for some time the old sailor said impatiently  whats the use of standin here like fools when we know shes hauled up somewhere along the beach well turn in an after sunrise try to think out another plan which will come to the same end this has  i have a mind to swim ashore and settle matters now with those villains joe said angrily  you would be the one to get settled i reckon and bob had so nearly recovered his composure as to laugh at the engineers expense both of us together wouldnt stand any show more especially in the night when theyd have all the advantage turn in with the boys an ill stand watch till im sleepy     chapter xxvi  bold thieves   the old sailor remained on duty until the day began to break the loss of the yawl troubled him more than he cared to say and this together with the possibility that she might have been taken during his watch drove all desire for sleep from his eyes  when the yellow shafts of light shot up from the eastern sky to herald the approach of dawn he awakened his companions and while the boys went into the galley to commence the labors of the day he and joe stood on the forwardbitt eagerly scanning the surrounding shore for some signs of the boat  in this they were not to be disappointed for as the shadows retreated the yawl stood revealed on the beach at the point where the sea birds crew emerged from the thicket when staggering under the weight of the pirates gold and standing near as if examining their stolen prize were the three men  theres one good thing about it bob said grimly by losin our boat we shall get rid of mr rednose and his friends an i aint sure but well be sellin em reasonably cheap  joe was so enraged by the sight that he could make no reply and the old sailor continued half to himself  it wont be sich a terrible job after theyve gone to build a raft thatll carry us ashore an prhaps the outcome of itll be our savin the steamer  the watchers had not long to wait before it became apparent that the party on shore did not intend to delay their departure  all three busied themselves with bringing bundles and boxes from the thicket after the survey of the boat was ended and in less than half an hour the little craft had a full load  a light breeze came from the west and after stepping on board it was only necessary to row the yawl a short distance from the shore when the sail filled causing her to glide slowly toward the open sea  bob and joe watched these maneuvers in silence without heeding jims announcement that breakfast was ready and much to the astonishment of both the sail was brailed up when the boat reached a point nearly opposite the steamer  ill be blowed if they havent got the nerve to speak us the old sailor exclaimed and almost at the same moment the rednosed man shouted as he raised his hat in mock politeness  were sorry to leave you here aground and without a tender but you didnt feel like makin any friendly talk to us yesterday mornin so we had to help ourselves i had an idee wed get the best end of the trade if it come to bein disagreeable  dont worry about us bob shouted angrily were glad to get rid of you at any price but my advice is that you give nassau a pretty wide berth  we should be ungrateful if we did not heed the counsel of those who have rigged the boat for us in such a satisfactory manner the mexican replied with a laugh and then the sheet was hauled aft once more and the little craft laid on such a course as would bring her close past the southerly point of the harbor  bob and joe remained silent and motionless until the thieves were shut out from view by the land and then the former said with an attempt to speak cheerfully  that ends em so far as we are concerned an its best not to think of the scoundrels agin weve either got to take up our quarters on the island or rig some plan for floatin the steamer an i reckon thatll occupy pretty much all our time lets get breakfast an then decide whats to be done  there was no necessity for spending many moments on deliberations when the morning meal had been eaten for whatever might be done the first step was to establish communication with the shore and this joe proposed to do when he came on deck again  the thieving crew were nowhere in sight as would have been the case had they sailed in almost any other than a southerly direction and it seemed probable that the yawl had been headed toward nassau despite the danger the men would incur of being arrested  i only hope theyll fool around in the vicinity until that schooner comes back and captures every one joe said in anything rather than a friendly tone after taking a deliberate survey of such portion of the ocean as could be seen from the tug and then he added abruptly as if determined to put all unpleasant thoughts far from his mind now what about getting on shore bob  we must rig up some kind of a raft i reckon an then stretch one of the heavin lines sos she can be pulled back and forth without too much work  jim you and harry overhaul the lines joe said as he began to undress and while bob is building the raft ill swim ashore  dont do it the old sailor cried warningly there are too many sharks around these keys to make swimmin very safe sport  we shant be likely to find them in such shoal water the boys can stay near the bow and with all hands on the lookout i dont fancy therell be much danger joe replied carelessly as he knotted around his waist the line jim brought  then without more ado he leaped overboard and so shallow was the cove at this point that hardly a dozen strokes were necessary before his feet touched the bottom and he waded ashore to where a mangrove grew near the edge of the bank  around this he fastened the rope and then returned to the steamer saying as he stepped on board  the sea bird crawled pretty well up on the shoal before the anchor caught  yes bob replied sadly shes got so much sand under her nose that im afraid shell stay here unlesswhich aint at all likelysome steamer puts in i was reckonin on usin timbers from the bulkhead for a raft but seeins how there aint much trouble in gettin ashore itll be best for the boys to make one out of treetrunks while you keep to work on the engine  are you countin on livin ashore jim asked anxiously  we may be glad to lad if another gale springs up well be ready to abandon the little steamer if the worst comes but all hands are to work tryin to float her jes the same as if we believed it could be done  the boys were not loath to be on the land once more they undressed with alacrity after bringing from below the axes and hatchets and with their clothes packed in an empty cask from out of which one of the heads had been taken they leaped overboard like a party of frogs  cut about twenty mediumsized trees and drag them to the beach after trimming off the branches joe shouted as they landed  the boys dressed quickly for the swarms of mosquitoes rendered clothes very necessary and at once set about the task of chopping selecting such mangroves and palms as grew nearest the shore in order to avoid so far as possible the labor of hauling them through the thick underbrush  then bob and joe began their portion of the labor although the old sailor believed the tug to be immovably fixed upon the sand he did not propose to neglect anything which would tend to extricate her of course it was possible something might occur to better her condition and in such an improbable event it was necessary she should be in working order besides as he said to joe it was as well to have a job on hand to occupy their attention as to idle the time away on the key  by noon the boys had collected sufficient materials for the raft and bob swam ashore to assist in building it  using ropes and vines instead of nails which were very precious just then quite a serviceable raft was put together and on it by the aid of the rope joe had stretched ashore all hands pulled themselves out to the steamer  the boys went into the galley to prepare dinner and after it had been eaten the weary crew indulged in a long siesta for the heat was almost overpowering  there was no thought of standing watch now their enemies had left the island and everybody gave himself up to the desire for slumber which made his eyelids heavy no one was sleeping very soundly and bob had only fallen into a doze when a report as loud as would have been caused by the discharge of a musket rang out on the still air causing boys and men to leap to their feet in alarm  what was it joe asked as he gazed around in bewilderment but without seeing any living thing either on the sea or land  im blest if i know bob replied in a tone of perplexity it sounded close aboard but how cansay is there anything below which could explode  not when theres no steam on  the old sailor stood staring at the shore in silence evidently seriously disturbed and the three boys gathered around him in alarm they had experienced so much which was both mysterious and terrible since the morning of the sail in the sally walker that to them every unusual sound or movement meant further disaster and bobs palpable fear caused something very like horror to come upon them  joe had mechanically started forward and before reaching the pilothouse he shouted to the intense relief of all  we were more scared than hurt this time it was only the heavingline it has parted and in doing so made the noise but i dont understand how there could be so much strain  bob glanced ashore quickly assured himself that one end of the rope was still made fast to the tree and then cried triumphantly as he pointed astern  theres where the strain came from the sun has been dryin the hawser till it pulled the tug back far enough to break the line that shows how much can be done by tryin the sea bird is ready to come off the shoal if we help her a bit so turn to lads an work for all youre worth till shes in deep water once more  the slackened hawser which a short time previous had been so taut told that bobs explanation was the correct one and there was no necessity to urge either the boys or joe any further to have a chance of saving the little steamer after all had firmly believed she was helplessly stranded aroused every member of the crew as nothing else save the actual arrival of friends could have done     chapter xxvii  the culmination of disasters   the first thing necessary was to ascertain exactly what portion of the steamers hull was imbedded in the sand and this bob proceeded to do with the leadline  it was found that only about twenty feet of the keel rested on the shoal the remainder overhanging four or five fathoms of water the tide was at its highest point which accounted for the movement of the steamer as the hawser shrank and bob cried in a cheery tone  i reckon it wont be impossible to launch the little craft after all by bringing the hawser on to the winch shiftin the ballast aft an heavin down with every ounce of muscle weve got somethin oughter be done at the next tide  every one was ready to exert himself to the utmost and in a very short space of time the heavy rope was brought to the winch after which all hands tugged and strained at the bars until the cable had been hove taut again  that done there was an opportunity for rest it would be useless to attempt anything more until the now receding waters should rise again which would be the case twelve hours later and the little crew gathered under the awning aft to discuss the new phase of affairs while joe continued his work on the metal for this task apparently so useless a few hours previous had suddenly become very important  the question is how long may we have to stop here after the tugs afloat bob remarked as he lighted his pipe and began once more to select from the timbers taken out of the cabin such as could be used on the shattered hull  by hard work it may be done in a weeks time joe replied after some thought  then youll keep steady at it while me an the boys tend to the other matters you shant be called to turn your hand on anything else till thas is done have we got coal enough for a threehundredmile run  joe shook his head  im afraid not but by taking on some wood we ought to be able to make it for i suppose youre counting on going to nassau  thats the nearest port an well see to choppin fuel when shes afloat an ive patched the bow a leetle more shipshape  during the remainder of the day when they were not engaged in the galley joe had some trifling work which could be performed by the boys and his every command was obeyed with alacrity for all hands were eager to utilize each moment in preparing for departure  that night a watch was kept although there was nothing to be feared from their late enemies bob proposed to have some more exercise at the winch when the tide was at its full height again and to that end it was necessary one of the party should remain awake to arouse the others at the proper time  this work however had no other result than that of awakening the weary sleepers unnecessarily labor as they did to the utmost of their strength the steamer was not moved so much as a single inch and the old sailor said after realizing the uselessness of the task  well have to shift everything aft i reckon before its possible to pull her off this blessed sand after sunset tomorrow well tackle the job an by the second tide have another turn at the winch  had the weary ones known just how fortunate they were in thus failing to pull the sea bird into deep water there would have been far less repining as they laid down once more on the mattresses under the awning  the gray light of approaching dawn had but just begun to steal across the sky when bob called all hands for another days labor and when the sun showed himself above the horizon each member of the crew was busily engaged  jim had positive orders to finish his task in the galley in the least possible time because joe wished to use the stove as a forge and the breakfast was by no means elaborate coffee being the only thing served hot  there isnt anything you boys can do on board this mornin an i reckon youd better begin the job of cuttin fuel to help out on the coal bob said when the rather unsatisfactory repast was brought to a close  how are we to get ashore harry asked the raft went adrift when the heavingline parted  she didnt go very far look off the port bow an youll see her on the beach it wont be much of a job for jim to run another rope out an hell be all the better for a bath  the young fisherman was not averse to what was little less than sport and if he did spend considerably more time in the water than was absolutely necessary no one could say any had really been wasted  when the raft was in working order once more harry and walter clambered on board and soon the shores of the harbor resounded with the blows of their axes owing to the scarcity of tools it was only possible for two to work at a time consequently each had a certain number of minutes in which to rest  it was after they had been on shore about two hours that walter during his idle moments wandered out from the thicket to see if there had by chance been any change in the steamers position and he had not left his companions more than five minutes when they heard him shout  come here fellows and see if you can tell what joe is doing it looks to me as if there was a big lot of smoke from the galley  not thinking it possible there could be anything wrong on the steamer neither jim nor harry obeyed the summons very quickly and when five minutes more had elapsed they were yet in the thicket  harry im sure theres some trouble aboard he shouted and this time it was the tone rather than the words which caused them to move quickly  on arriving where a view of the steamer could be had joe and bob were seen working industriously under the awning but a thick black smoke was flowing out of the companionway the light breeze carried it shoreward consequently the laborers from whom it was hidden by the deckhouse were wholly ignorant of what seemed to walter very alarming  it did not require many seconds for jim to make up his mind as to the cause of this unusual vapor and his face grew pale as he cried sharply  the steamer is on fire hurry up an get aboard then as he ran at full speed along the shore he shouted loudly bob bob fire fire  these cries were heard by the workmen before the boys gained the raft and on glancing shoreward the telltale smoke was seen  in an instant both men were forward and after stopping only the merest fraction of time to investigate matters bob began to draw up water with the deckbucket thus giving full confirmation to the fears of those on the raft who were pulling desperately toward the steamer  both men were working with the utmost speed dashing water into the companionway and causing the smoke to rise in yet denser volumes only once did either speak and then when bob shouted in a hoarse voice  hurry on lads well need all hands at this job if the steamer is to be saved  this injunction was unnecessary for the boys were making every effort to propel the raft at the swiftest possible rate of speed the water boiled around the forward timbers as if a strong current was setting down toward them and there was every danger that in their haste the frail craft would be forced asunder  long though the time occupied in the passage appeared to be when so much might depend upon an early arrival it was really not more than five minutes from the time the boys left the shore until they were on deck searching for some article in which water could be carried  with the exception of the two buckets used by bob and joe everything of the kind was in the galley and after a hurried frantic search of the cabin and engineroom the boys went forward emptyhanded  there isnt so much as a dipper here jim screamed  an its jes as well bob replied hoarsely as a volume of flame burst from the companionway nothin less than a fireengine would do any good now its time we saved whatll be needed ashore knock off joe an well load the raft  the engineer was not willing to give up the struggle so easily he worked like a fury dashing water on the roaring leaping flames which were already sending out long streams on the tarcovered seams and not until the fire had full possession of the forward portion did he cease his more than useless labors to assist the others  meanwhile bob and the boys had been throwing bedding tools and every article within reach on the raft it was not until after they had been thus engaged several moments that any one thought of the treasure in the hold and then jim cried more frantically than before  the gold the gold we must get that out  itll have to take its chances with the rest bob replied sharply even if we could get below the fire would be upon us before the bags were uncovered life is worth more than money jes now  not until everything from the engineroom and cabin which could be of any service ashore had been piled up on the raft did bob pause and then the flames covered more than twothirds of the deck as a matter of course the heavingline was long since burned from the winch and nothing held the rude craft which now bore all their worldly possessions but the painter harry had made fast to the sternbitt  we shall have to swim for it lads bob said as he shielded his face from the intense heat with his hat the raft is loaded so deep that the weight of one of us would swamp her  as he spoke he seized walter by the waist and leaped overboard jim waiting only long enough to ask harry if he needed any assistance before following the example  dont bother about me harry replied and then as the flames came nearer he plunged into the sea joe lingering a few seconds longer as if to take one last look at the little craft he had tried so hard to save  the wind carried the raft shoreward as soon as the painter was let go therefore those in the water had nothing to care for save their own safety  in less than ten minutes all hands were standing on the beach watching with deepest sorrow written on every feature of their countenances the destruction of the tug in which they had so fondly hoped soon to be steaming toward home  illustration the engineer seized walter by the waist and leaped overboard     chapter xxviii  shore life   the little party on the beach remained as if spellbound while the fire destroyed what seemed like the last link which bound them to home the only sounds to be heard save the roaring of the flames were when a deep quivering sigh came from walters lips or joe gave vent to a suppressed groan  the fire leaped and danced as if in fiendish glee devouring the woodwork of the sea bird and warping the machinery beyond all further usefulness until there was no longer anything above water for it to feed upon then slowly with many a protesting hiss and puff of steam it gradually died away the last smouldering ember expiring in less than two hours from the discovery of the danger  nothing was left of what had been a jaunty little craft save the blackened lines which marked the position of the hull lying in six feet of water  when all was over and the smoke no longer arose bob said with an evident effort  well lads were what you might call shipwrecked at last though it jes the same as took two good vessels an a tug to finish us up whinin wont do any good an weve got to make some kind of a start at buildin a hut for were here till a craft puts in by mistake an takes us off  im the one to blame for this last disaster joe said moodily nobody but a fool would have left a roaring fire in the galley without so much as looking at it now and then  dont go to kickin up a fuss with yourself bob said soothingly we all know it was an accident for you set even more by the steamer than we did what puzzles me though is how it could a happened no matter how much fire there was  in order to heat the iron i took off the top of the stove and opened the entire front on leaving i paid no attention to closing it and of course some of the coals must have fallen out  we was rich once anyhow jim said with a sigh its too bad we worked so hard to get the gold aboard for it didnt have a chance to do us any good  jes about this time grub is worth more to us than all the money pirates ever saw bob replied quite sharply as if realizing the necessity of arousing his companions from their unavailing sorrow weve got a tidy bit of work that must be done between this an sunset an its time we were beginning  as he spoke he went up the beach a short distance to where the raft had grounded in twelve inches of water and began to unload her carrying the goods beyond the line of sand to the edge of the thicket  he was not allowed to labor alone but a few moments the others were soon at his side working with a will and this necessary exertion was most beneficial since it prevented the little party from dwelling on their misfortunes  the awning was among the articles saved from the steamer and the first task after the raft had been unloaded was to set this up as a tent in the same place where the rednosed man and his companions had encamped then it was necessary to build a fireplace bring all the goods from the shore and stow the perishable articles under the canvas where they would not be destroyed in case of a storm  in order to complete this work before sunset it was essential that each member of the party should do his best regardless of fatigue and when the task was finished just as the sun began to descend beyond the horizon the boys were so nearly exhausted that bob said  crawl under the tent and lay down ill see to what little cookin weve got on hand an it shall be your watch below till mornin  the canvas had been fastened to four trees in such a manner as to form a shedlike roof and while it would be of but little service in event of a heavy storm it afforded sufficient shelter to protect the homeless ones from the dew and the sun therefore until the weather changed it was all that could be desired  the question of food was the most disheartening and caused bob no slight amount of anxiety they had saved only such articles as chanced to be on deck a round of pork which jim brought from the forepeak and left under the awning quite by accident when he was preparing for the voyage in the yawl half a dozen pounds of shipsbiscuit from the cabinlocker a sheet of cornbread which together with a jug of molasses the workmen had taken from the galley to serve as lunch and about a peck of potatoes made up the total amount of provisions for five people until aid in some form should come  there was barely enough for two days consumption and no one knew better than bob how long a time might elapse before a vessel approached near enough to be signaled  this was the one thought in his mind as he built a small fire and broiled a limited number of slices cut from the pork while joe was busily engaged stowing the last of their belongings under the canvas  its a case of turtlehuntin tomorrow i reckon he said grimly as the engineer having arranged the goods to his satisfaction threw himself on the grass near the fire itll be mighty short rations for all hands unless we look sharp  there ought to be plenty of fish in the cove joe replied after a moments thought ill make something thatll serve as a hook and the boys can spend their time on the raft there are oysters here most likely and if the bonita struck the shoal anywhere near something eatable may have been washed ashore  i hadnt thought of that and bobs face brightened as he spoke you an i will take a trip around the key in the mornin an then perhaps things will look more cheerful i reckon were all tired enough to sleep tonight but from the next sunrise somebody must be on watch for a sail every hour its the only chance weve got now of ever leavin this blessed place  then send walter out on the point after breakfast for the next few days standing watch will be the lightest work an he being the smallest should have the softest job  i guess thats about the way well fix things bob replied as he laid the last slice of smoked and blackened pork on a broad leaf lets have supper an turn in sos to be on deck early in the mornin  it was not a very palatable meal to which the boys were summoned a small piece of cornbread two shipsbiscuit and one thick slice of the poor apology for meat was what bob portioned out to each and when the unsatisfactory repast was ended all save joe crawled under the canvas on the two mattresses he remained by the fire until a rude fishhook had been fashioned from a stout piece of iron wire when joining the others he also was soon wrapped in the blissful unconsciousness of sleep  at a very early hour next morning jim resumed his duties as cook and the breakfast was even less appetizing than the supper  then bob read the party a short lesson which he thought and with good reason they needed  now my hearties work is what we all want to keep us from thinkin too much of the little steamer that has gone up in smoke an there must be a good bit of it unless were willin to go hungry dont worry about anything but remember some kind of craft is bound to put in here before long an if the gold is frettin you why im bound to say theres no reason to look on it as lost  this last remark caused no amount of surprise among his audience and noting the good effect he spoke more decidedly  the treasure was packed under the ballast an before the fire could get anywhere near it the hull must a been full of water now to pull it out aint much moren childs play but its our duty to lay in a fair stock of grub before tacklin the job an we can work knowin all hands are as rich as they were before the fire started  this little speech did a wonderful amount of good despite their forlorn and perhaps dangerous position every member of the party had bewailed the loss of the gold more than any other thing but now that bob spoke of recovering it in such a matteroffact tone they suddenly regained all their lost courage and were ready to begin the labors of the day  immediately after being awakened joe had begun the tedious task of weaving a fishingline from the strands of the heavingrope and by the time bob concluded his inspiriting speech a cord thirty feet long was completed  to attach the rudelyfashioned hook and a rock to serve as sinker required only a few moments and then jim and harry had their portion of the work mapped out  use the pork as bait an when youve caught fish enough for dinner knock off weve got nothin to cure em with an theres no sense in takin moren we can eat at one time walter is to stand watch on the north point an you can join him when your job is finished  then the two men and the boy started off around the shore to the only place on the key from which a passing craft could be seen and the young fisherman with some pieces of halfburned planks as oars sculled the raft out into deep water  a brisk walk of half an hour was necessary before a sightly spot for the sentinel could be found and joe said as he and bob continued on around the beach to search for oysters  itll be a bit lonesome here walt but you must do a share of the work keep your weathereye lifting all the time an if you see any kind of a craft sing out till we answer  walter did feel a trifle nervous at being left alone so far from his companions but he made a manly effort to appear brave and said as the men walked swiftly away  dont trouble yourselves about me i can stand watch as well as any one else and if a sail does heave in sight you shall know it  thats right lad keep up your courage whatever may happen an everything will come out shipshape bob shouted cheerily as he and joe disappeared around a clump of bushes leaving walter alone with the mournful lip lip lip of the sea ringing in his ears like a funeral dirge     chapter xxix  preparing the beacons   after leaving the sentinel on duty bob and joe walked around the shore at a rapid pace for it was their purpose to explore the island while searching for food and wreckage and since it would be almost dangerous to remain on the open beach after the sun was high in the heavens there was really but a few hours during which their investigations could be pursued  as a matter of course they were eager to get some definite idea of where the bonita had been stranded in order to know at which point the wreckage would be likely to come ashore and this information was soon gained after a brisk walk of half an hour the searchers were at the most northerly end of the key and directly before them not more than half a mile from the beach in a westerly direction was the wreck  the gale which had driven the sea bird ashore had torn and riven the illfated brig until she was little more than a shapeless mass of timbers and then thrown her high up on the sands where she presented a mournfullooking spectacle in every direction could be seen casks spars cordage and splintered timbers some halfburied on the beach while others dotted the shoals along the west side of the key  it will be a good weeks work to overhaul all that stuff joe said after the two had surveyed the scene of desolation several moments in silence there is plenty of material with which to make a flare in case it should be needed  thats what wed better prepare fer before doin anything else bob replied those casks are full of alcohol an by rollin half a dozen to different points along the shore from here to where we left walter i reckon we can make sich a show of fireworks that none but a blind crew could get past without seein us  im beginning to think vessels dont come this way we shouldnt have seen a single one since weve been here if that schooner hadnt put in for the express purpose of capturing those men  dont get sich an idee into your head lad the old sailor said cheerily were right in the track of traders an steamers but this is the wrong season of the year a month from now youll see two or three a week  thats a long while to wait on short allowance  its way ahead of how we might a been fixed now instead of moonin bout what cant be helped spose we get the casks where they can be used when the right time comes  joes depression was but momentary he understood quite as well as did his companion the evils of giving way to dismal thoughts when so much depended upon their own efforts and without further words the task was begun  to roll the heavy casks over the loose sand was fatiguing and when the sun climbed so high that the heat became almost unbearable only three of the barrels were in position the first of these was at the most northerly point of the island another had been set on end beyond reach of the tide two hundred yards south and the last was about the same distance down the shore  these could be made ready for lighting in a few seconds since it was proposed only to knock in the heads pour out half the contents to prevent the possibility of an explosion and set fire to the remainder  by rollin thirty or forty casks beyond highwater mark we shall have plenty of fuel in case the first attempt is a failure bob said as they walked down the beach to where walter was on watch there wont be any change in the weather for a week or more an in that time we can gather a good stock of alcohol  when bob and joe arrived at the point there was little need of asking if the sentinel had sighted anything resembling a sail for while working they were able to gain even a more extended view than he and not so much as a seagulls wing could be seen  jim and harry were with walter they having accomplished their task in the most satisfactory manner  it didnt take ten minutes to catch all we can eat between now an mornin jim said in reply to joes question if the mary walker was here she could get a full fare in half a day for the fish bite like mackerel jes say the word an ill roast some now so we shant have to walk back to the tent  go ahead lad an after the sun gets a little lower well take you an harry up the beach where theres considerable work to be done  anticipating that his proposition would be accepted jim had made ready for the culinary operations to the extent of collecting a goodly supply of fuel and in less than an hour the little party were feasting on fish roasted in leaves among the hot ashes  until about three oclock they remained within shelter of the foliage near the sea enjoying the siesta even though their condition was well calculated to dishearten the most sanguine and then bob proposed that they continue the work of preparing beacons  in this labor the two boys could accomplish quite as much as bob and joe and half an hour before sunset ten casks were in the desired positions now it would be possible in a very short time to send up such a volume of flame as would illumine all that portion of the coast and from a craft within ten miles of the key it could readily be seen  we can reckon on leavin this place aboard the first vessel that heaves in sight bob said in a tone of satisfaction as they walked leisurely along the shore of the harbor toward the camp of course it wouldnt do any good to stand watch after dark but some one must be on the point every hour of daylight an the boys can divide that work to suit themselves  it would not be the most cheerful task this remaining alone on the shore gazing out over the restless ocean but only through such work was there a probable chance of rescue and the discomfort or weariness did not have so much as a place in their thoughts  the preparations for attracting attention had caused the boys to believe their time of imprisonment was rapidly drawing to a close bobs positive statement that the chain of flares could not fail of being seen caused them to appear like the first real step taken toward home and the thought of the pirates treasure came uppermost in the minds of all  why not begin work on it tomorrow jim asked when bob referred to the task as one easy of accomplishment harry an i can catch fish enough in half an hour to last a week an if we wait too long another storm may break up the hull so that the gold cant be found  i reckon weve got little to fear from storms yet awhile bob replied carelessly this weather is likely to hold for a week or more  that may be joe said and then again its possible for you to be mistaken i think as jim doesthat we ought to save it while theres a chance if this weather holds the casks of alcohol will stay where they are and it is as well to let that portion of the work wait as delay the other and more important  im agreeable to anything only i didnt feel as if there was a great call to be in a hurry cause it would have to be a roarin old gale that could do much damage to the hulk and bob looked across the harbor to the narrow line of charcoal and blackened timbers which might be seen just above the surface of the water if things are as i think it wont be a long job an we can finish it up in one day  then whats the use of wasting time if a vessel puts in here we would be ready to leave at once and her crew might think themselves entitled to a good slice of the money if they helped us get it out of the wreck  the boys agreed perfectly with joe and since bob had no objections to the plan it was decided that the work should be begun on the following morning  the little party were in the tent by the time this decision was arrived at and the shelter had been gained none too soon for the gloom of another night had already settled down over the key although all hands were tired no one cared to go to sleep just then because of the excitement caused by mention of the treasure and a small fire was built for the double purpose of driving away mosquitoes and lending a more cheerful aspect to the encampment  while bob and joe discussed plans for the next mornings work the boys listened intently and it was not until a very late hour in the night that any one thought of retiring then the old sailor said gruffly as if some peremptory command of his had been disobeyed  dont you ever mean to turn in or must i lay every blessed son of you away all hands want to become divers but unless we get some sleep before mornin there wont be much work done  i spose we can keep awake as long as the skipper does jim said laughingly and for reply bob picked him up bodily and threw him on one of the mattresses with strict injunctions to snore in five minutes or expect a taste of the ropesend  never since the day when the bonita ran away with the crew of the sally walker had the boys been so cheerful and this enviable frame of mind was brought about by the preparations made for signaling a vessel they were not one whit nearer being rescued but yet it seemed as if the time for leaving the key was already very close at hand  if ten casks of alcohol can make this crowd feel so good wed better endup about a hundred tomorrow joe said as the campfire was extinguished and all hands crept under the canvas  it seems as if we were going to see home at last harry replied bob says we are certain of being sighted by the first crew that passes and in that case it isnt likely we shall have to stay here much longer  you can take my word for it lad that before another week goes by we shall be on our way either to the states or nassau so go to sleep for i reckon on callin all hands mighty early in the mornin  it was not so easy for the boys to close their eyes in slumber owing to the unusual excitement but they did finally succeed and when bob shouted all hands on deck just as the sun showed his glowing face above the waters once more every member of the party leaped to his feet ready for the days work  their toilets were soon made by a hurried plunge into the sea and a not very pleasant rubdown with a piece of canvaswhich does not make a satisfactory toweland then while jim prepared breakfast from the limited material at his command bob went out to the point for his regular mornings survey of the surrounding waters  theres nothin in sight he reported on his return in obedience to the cooks summons but we mustnt get discouraged if a craft dont show up for a week walter is to go on guard as soon as he gets breakfast an one of you boys can spell him toward noon  the toasted pork and shipsbiscuit was not so inviting as to induce any of the party to linger very long over the meal and in a few moments after the old sailors return all hands were ready to begin the work which would settle the question as to whether the treasure could be recovered or if it had been found only to be lost forever     chapter xxx  amateur divers   the details of the work had been decided upon during the conversation held the evening previous therefore there was nothing to prevent them from putting into immediate execution the plan proposed by bob  walter went around to the left shore of the harbor to reach his lonely post of duty while the others made their way in the opposite direction to where the raft had been partially pulled up on the beach  its a case of swimmin but i think we had better keep on our trousers and shirts otherwise the flies and mosquitoes will make matters too lively for us bob said as he removed a portion of his clothing and then waded into the water to launch the raft on a hot day like this we shall soon dry off an be none the worse for the bath  the work was to be done entirely by diving as a matter of course and since the laborers would be out of the water a greater portion of the time the old sailors advice was very good to expose their bare skins to the fervent rays of the sun and the attacks of insects would cause great suffering  they carried with them nothing but a piece of the heavingline and two lengths of iron pipe which had been taken from the burning steamer only because they chanced to be on deck these last would serve as a weight to hold them down in the water and also as a poor apology for shovels in digging away the ballast covering the treasure but joe hoped to find the long firehoe a tool which would lessen their labors very materially  the two elder members of the party waded out in advance pulling the raft after them while the boys pushed on the timbers until the depth of water made swimming a necessity when harry and jim allowed themselves to be towed  not more than half an hour was spent getting the collection of timbers into position and then they were made fast to the charred rail near the bow opposite that portion of the hull where the treasure was supposed to be  if the machinery had fallen toward the stern there was every chance the work would be successful but in case it tumbled forward when the wooden supports were burned all hope was vain because the heavy metal could not be hoisted out with the limited means at their command  the boiler remained upright held in position by the bolts and bands of iron which were fastened to the keel itself and joe said as the excited party stood a moment on the raft to survey the scene  six feet forward of the boiler is where we must search and id better make the first attempt for i can tell just what part of the machinery is in our road while the rest of you wouldnt know so much about it  lower yourself by the timbers it wont do to dive head foremost until were sure everything is clear and bob held out his hand to assist the engineer in making the descent  joe fastened the heavingline to the iron pipes that he might have weight enough to hold him at the bottom while making the investigation when those on the raft could haul up the metal to be used again and swinging clear of the rail with bobs aid he sunk beneath the surface  never had a hundred seconds appeared so long to harry as now it seemed that the diver had been out of sight fully five minutes and he was beginning to fear some accident had happened when joe reappeared gasping for breath but looking very happy  theres nothing to interfere with our working he said as soon as it was possible to speak nearly everything has fallen aft and with the exception of some light fittings the ballast is as free as when we left it  is the raft in the right position bob asked  as near as i can make out it should be run ahead ten or a dozen feet i pulled away five or six of the largest rocks but a fellow cant do very much work when its impossible to breathe  bob was eager to make the descent and after jim had pulled in the pipeweights he hauled the raft ahead where harry and joe made her fast again as the old sailor disappeared beneath the surface  he remained below several seconds longer than had the engineer and on coming up confirmed the first report  its only a matter of time before well have our hands on that gold once more he said i reckon joe begun in the right place an we must all work on the same hole jim you go over and leave harry to tend to the weights  whats to be done when im down there  pull away the rocks an gravel as weve done dont try to stay too long at a time but work lively while you are there  jim was too good a swimmer to be afraid and he leaped in from the rail since there was no further fear in making the descent he looked red in the face when harry saw him again but appeared to be in high glee  its nothin moren ive done down to the isle of shoals lots of times when the fellers have tried to see who could stay under water the longest he said as harry pulled in the weight and joe took possession of it at once that the work might not be delayed  i thought it was my turn and harry looked disappointed because he had not been allowed to follow jim  youll have plenty of chances after awhile bob replied although it dont seem very much to do none of us can keep it up a great while tend to the weights till jim needs a rest an then take his place  but little time was spent in conversation now that the work had fairly begun in rapid succession the divers leaped from the raft until each had made a dozen descents when it became necessary for them to rest and harry was allowed to do his share  he performed but little work during the first descent because by the time he had looked about him with no slight degree of curiosity it became necessary to rise to the surface for air he was surprised however with the progress made the ballast had been dug and pushed away until a deep excavation could be seen and it seemed certain the greater portion of the treasures covering had been removed  to his delight it was reserved for him to raise the first package of the precious metal while the others were stretched out on the raft resting from the fatiguing work he went down four times in rapid succession and then electrified his companions by shouting as he came to the surface  ive got one bag out but cant bring it up  during the next two or three moments the divers cheered until walter must have heard the noise and then joe said as he took from his pocket a stout piece of wire bent in the form of a hook  while you fellows were talking last night i made this well bend it on one end of the heavingline and it will only be necessary to stick the wire into the canvas when those on the raft can pull up the bag  harry was eager to have the credit of taking out the first lot of treasure and recognizing his right the others waited until he had fastened on the hook joe hauling in the coin at the same time the divers head appeared above the surface  another prolonged cheer greeted this first tangible result of their labors and it was so hearty that walter appeared from around the point having evidently come for the purpose of learning the cause of the noise  he was too far away for the happy divers to enter into any lengthy conversation with him and joe held up the bag of gold where it could be seen  there was no question but that he understood the good news for during the next five minutes he capered around the beach in the most extravagant fashion and not until the others turned to resume their labors did he go back to his post of duty  since only one nineteenth of the treasure had been recovered there was yet considerable work to be performed more especially as each could remain below but a few seconds at a time and the task was continued with redoubled energy  when the divers were forced to rest again two more bags had been hoisted on to the raft and after the number was increased to five bob said  we must knock off until later in the day it wont do to stay in the water too long or this gold will cost the lives of some of us well call walter in have dinner and try again when the sun gets lower  jim did not fancy ceasing work until the entire amount of treasure had been recovered although he needed rest as much as either of the others  itll take two days at this rate if we keep diving all the time he said disconsolately an i think it ought to be finished right up  the hardest part is done now that the ballast is well cleared away an i reckon well come mighty nigh endin the job by sunset bob replied but no matter how long it lasts weve got to look out for ourselves an too much water is as bad as not enough halloo walter walter  the remainder of the party joined in the cry until the sentinel appeared from around the point staggering under the weight of some heavy load which was carried on his back by gestures the boy was made to understand that he should come to the camp and the others speculated as to the nature of his burden while they pulled the raft and its precious cargo ashore  perhaps hes found more gold jim suggested  i reckon its oysters there are some on the south side of the point an most likely thats how he has been fillin up his time  in this supposition bob was correct walter had occupied himself in gathering a quantity of the tiny bivalves which he brought to camp by converting his coat into a bag and a most welcome and appetizing meal did they make for the divers who were too weary to spend any time fishing  the sentinel was profuse in his expressions of joy that the task of recovering the treasure had proved to be comparatively such a simple one and he insisted on carrying every bag to the tent that the divers might gain the greatest possible amount of rest before continuing their work  after a big fire had been built the tiny oysters were thrown on the coals and drawn out with split sticks when they showed signs of being roasted this was such delicious food that twice the number walter brought could have been eaten although the supply formed a reasonably hearty meal and it was decided unanimously to spend at least one day gathering these delicacies as soon us the operations at the wreck were concluded     chapter xxxi  suspense   on this day the siesta was not prolonged every member of the party was eager to be at work again and much sooner than bob had intended they were pushing the raft out to the wreck while walter was making his way around the beach to resume the apparently useless task of watching  again was harry forced to perform that which seemed to be the least important portion of the work bob believed and with good reason that the boy could not endure as much as the others who were more accustomed to fatigue therefore he positively forbade his diving save at rare intervals  the work during the afternoon was conducted as in the earlier portion of the day but it progressed much more rapidly because the ballast had been removed to avoid a repetition of detail it is sufficient to say that the sun was yet two hours high in the heavens when harry pulled up the nineteenth bag and that which had seemed a wellnigh hopeless task was accomplished  it was well that the last portion of the treasure had been taken out quickly for the alternate diving and standing in the hot air affected all hands so severely that it is doubtful if either could have continued the work an hour longer  as a matter of course harry was comparatively fresh he having been under the water only five or six times and when the clumsy craft was pulled ashore he insisted on carrying the entire treasure to the tent  the weary divers lay on the warm sand in wet clothing which was being speedily dried by the sun until the last heavy bag had been taken to the tent and covered by the mattresses even then they would have continued to enjoy their wellearned rest if a most welcome announcement had not been made by the sentinel  it was just as harry returned from the final trip to the tent that he electrified his companions by shouting  there comes walt at full speed perhaps a vessel is in sight  every member of the party was on his feet in an instant watching the sentinel who ran along the beach waving his hat in the most frantic manner and on getting within hailing distance cried using both hands as a speakingtrumpet  i can see something to the northward its pretty far away but im sure its a vessel  harry and jim were literally wild with excitement because of this joyful news but bob remained sufficiently calm to be able to calculate as to the length of time before the stranger could approach within hailing distance  there isnt wind enough to bring her this way very fast he said after what seemed to be a long pause weve got time to start all the signals in good shape pick up the axes an well see what kind of flares fifteen or twenty gallons of alcohol will make  jim and harry obeyed this command without loss of time and then started around the beach at full speed but bob and joe followed more leisurely  the boys might as well have husbanded their strength as was learned on arriving at the point for to the great disappointment of both the sail was so far away that it became necessary to search the horizonline several moments before discovering the tiny white speck  that isnt much to feel glad about harry said as if believing the sentinel had caused needless excitement  its a good deal more than weve seen before except when the schooner from nassau put in here walter replied it didnt look half as big when i first saw it and i watched a long time before telling you  while harry and jim were gazing at that which looked more like the wing of a bird than a canvas large enough to propel a ship bob and joe arrived they did not appear to be at all disappointed and in fact the old sailor stared at the tiny object as if it was even nearer than he expected while he said to the engineer  i reckon well be able to make out what kind of a craft she is before dark there is yet considerable of a job necessary to get the signals in workin order an wed better begin  the entire party would be needed and all hands started up the beach halting at the first cask the head of this was knocked in a little more than half its contents poured out and one of the signals was in readiness for the spark of light which would send the flames mounting skyward  aint you goin to touch her off jim asked as the old sailor went toward the next beacon  therell be time enough when weve attended to the whole lot that craft is on her reglar course bound for nassau most likely an will keep on within two or three miles of the key  it was an hour before the last cask had been prepared and in that time the stranger had lessened the distance so much that bob unhesitatingly pronounced her a topsail schooner  her spars look a leetle too trim for a trader an she carries so much sail that i reckon shes a pleasure craft with a lot of freshwater sailors aboard howsomever theyll know enough to stand in when they see this ere illumination an that oughter satisfy us  bob waited half an hour longer before firing the alcohol and then the evening shadows were beginning to lengthen into the gloom of night all the strangers spars could be seen quite distinctly and there was but little question that she was a yacht  when the bluish flames leaped up casting a ghastly glare upon the surrounding objects it was no longer possible for the party on the key to see any distance over the ocean because of the blinding light but they had the intense satisfaction of knowing that the sudden illumination must of a necessity be observed by those on the schooner and also that its purpose could not be mistaken  set em all ablaze boys bob shouted and one by one the long pillars of flame shot up from the beach until that portion of the key was fringed with fiery monuments  after this had been done the little party stood at the waters edge trying in vain to peer through the gloom which was growing more dense each moment and in a short while it was ascertained that brilliant though the beacons were they would not continue so any very great length of time the alcohol burned furiously sending forth an intense heat which caused the casks to burst asunder thereby allowing large quantities of the spirits to sink in the sand and half an hour after the first had been ignited the volume of flame decreased very materially  this wont do joe cried in dismay by the time that schooner gets near the island our signals will have died out entirely and they may keep on their course without thinking it worth while to stop  we could cut some wood harry suggested but realized even as he spoke how insignificant would be such a fire after these mighty shafts of flame  itll be better to roll more casks down bob said quickly never mind the work so long as we can hail that craft  no one cared how much labor might be involved providing the desired result was gained and all hands ran swiftly up the beach to where the bonitas cargo lay half buried in the sand it was as much as the three boys could do to roll a heavy cask over the shingle but they worked manfully while bob and joe struggled with another and in a few moments after the first two signals had died out they were replaced by fresh supplies of this costly fuel  during the next three hours every member of the party tugged and pulled and lifted with a feverish energy born of the knowledge that their chances of being rescued depended upon the exertions made and then it was not possible to longer continue the task all were so exhausted that further efforts were absolutely out of the question and bob said as he wiped away the perspiration which ran down his face in tiny streams  its no use lads what with the divin an this last job im tuckered out if she dont pay any attention to us after all this glare we couldnt make em stop by telling the whole story  perhaps she has already passed harry suggested as he choked back a sob the rate at which that schooner was sailing when we last saw her would have brought her here long before this  for all we can tell she may be hoveto half a mile off the shore bob said consolingly a captain would need know this shoal mighty well to run in here on a night so black as this one  theyve got the lights to guide them and from the tone of walters voice it could be understood he was giving way to despair  that wouldnt do them any good for these flames only illumine this portion of the coast and throw the entrance of the harbor into deeper shadow joe said speaking for the first time since the labors were brought to a close besides there are such things as false lights kindled for the purpose of wrecking vessels and any careful captain would most likely want to wait for daylight but he might at least send a boat ashore  this last portion of the engineers remarks took from the boys any consolation they might have found in his speculations and they seated themselves on the sand very wretched both in body and mind  the beacons expired one by one and the last was but a feeble flickering flame when the report of firearms rang out sharp and distinct on the still air causing every member of that mournful party to spring to his feet in alarm  the detonations had not been heard at regular intervals as one might naturally suppose would be the case if they served as signals to let the castaways know that succor was at hand but came together in a rapid volley as if several weapons were discharged at the same time and those on the beach looked at each other in dismay  whats the meaning of that harry asked nervously and the old sailor replied gravely  i dont know lad it may be they want us to understand that the schooner will stand by till mornin an then agin there may be some trouble aboard  are they near enough for us to hail them  no not accordin to them sounds i should say the schooner was a good half mile away anyhow we know shes near an the rest can be found out at sunrise  to wait until morning before there could be an end to the painful suspense appeared almost as bad as to know the vessel had continued on without paying any attention to their signals and jim said petulantly  it seems as if they might let us know what was goin to be done  theres no use to kick agin what cant be helped lad try to go to sleep an then the time wont appear so long  to follow this advice was entirely out of the question it would have been impossible for the weariest of the party to close his eyes in slumber and in silence and fear they waited for the long dreary hours of the night to pass     chapter xxxii  joy   it was useless for the boys to argue with themselves that the rapid discharge of musketry could have no sinister meaning they were in that frame of mind when no silver lining can be seen even to the smallest cloud and against their own better judgment they decided that the strange schooner either would be of no assistance to them or that she was manned by a crew which might attempt to inflict further injuries  joe thoughtlessly suggested that perhaps the rednosed man was in command and had come to get the bonitas cargo this was said more in jest than as something with a possible foundation of truth but it was sufficient to excite all of jims fears and he actually tried to induce harry and walter to go with him into the thicket where they might hide until the schooner had left the vicinity  while the boys would not agree to anything quite as wild as this they were seriously alarmed and when the rattle and splash of oars broke the stillness walter was almost sorry he had not followed the young fishermans advice  we havent got to wait long before findin out if theyll take us away from this blessed key bob said cheerily here comes a boat an unless im makin a big mistake well soon be leavin this ere cove bound for some civilized port  louder and more distinctly sounded the clink of oars in the rowlocks until from out the darkness came the welcome hail  ahoy on the island  halloo bob shouted with a roar as if afraid any ordinary cry would not be heard by those from whom he expected assistance  have you got three boys there who were carried away from the isle of shoals in the brig bonita  ay ay an theyll be mighty glad of a chance to leave  this question surprised the boys almost to the verge of bewilderment it was positive the rednosed man would not ask for them so solicitously and yet who else in that lonely portion of the ocean knew anything regarding their mishaps  harry and walter clasped hands as if in a daze both so excited as to be unable to speak until a second voice from out the darkness shouted  are you there harry  its father its father harry screamed as he ran toward the water and there with walter at his side he stood straining his eyes in the vain effort to see the boat but in his joyful astonishment giving no heed to the apparently strange fact that those whom he loved had known so well where to look for the bonitas involuntary crew  it was not possible for the little craft to land with safety on the beach where the surf was breaking with sufficient force to overturn if not stave her to pieces and he who had first hailed now cried  is there a landingplace near by  youre at the mouth of a cove in which theres water enough to float a ship joe replied ill walk along the beach to where there is no surf  by shouting continually he succeeded in piloting the boat behind the point where a landing could be effected and a few moments later both harry and walter were clasped in mr vandynes arms  for some moments no word was spoken and then the boys poured forth a flood of questions regarding the loved ones from whom they had been so long separated  they are all well at home mr vandyne replied laughingly but we had better settle down for the night before i attempt to give you the information required shall we go aboard the schooner  in their exceeding great joy the boys had forgotten the treasure entirely and it is quite probable they would have said yes to the last question but for bob he had not been in such a state of despair prior to the coming of the boat as to render happiness so bewildering and he also had a very clear idea of what should be done  i axes your pardon for interfering sir he said stepping very close to mr vandyne and speaking in a low tone but theres particular reasons why youd better have a chance to talk with us alone afore your crew comes ashore or we leave the key  harrys father was considerably mystified by this odd statement but he hesitated only an instant before asking  have you got any kind of a shelter  a decently good tent with a couple of mattresses to lie on bob replied it aint the best that ever was but you can manage to get along one night i reckon  its something weve found that he wants you to see harry whispered and turning to the crew who were lying on their oars a short distance away mr vandyne said  i will stay on shore until morning go back to the yacht and at sunrise if you think theres no danger bring her into this cove  ay ay sir a voice replied and then the sound of oars in the water told that the boat was leaving the harbor probably steering for a tiny red light which could now be seen some distance off the land  what have you got which there is so much mystery about mr vandyne asked as the gentle splash and ripple of water which told that the sailors were returning to their craft died away in the distance  we have found a pirates treasure harry said in a whisper there are nineteen bags full of all kinds of money  pirates treasure his father repeated in astonishment  what the lad says is a fact sir and bob stepped forward once more we had no way of findin out how much it was worth but theres altogether too big an amount for us to run the risk of lettin strangers see the pile  where is it  at the camp sir ill lead the way jim you foller behind me an let joe bring up the rear  then bob set out at such a rapid pace that there was but little opportunity for conversation until the entire distance had been traversed  joe and jim built a huge campfire and after harry introduced his father to the three members of the party who were strangers bob pulled from beneath the mattresses one of the treasure bags  there are eighteen more jes like that he said as he slashed the tarred canvas with his knife until the yellow coins fell in a golden stream at mr vandynes feet we havent overhauled many of em but ones a fair sample of the lot  why youve got a fortune here the gentleman cried in surprise as he assured himself that the pieces were gold and of large denomination where and how did you find it  itll need a pretty long yarn to give you an understandin of the whole cruise an well each do a share of the spinnin so the thing will come out shipshape bob said as he began to fill a pipe that his character of storyteller might be enacted properly youve got all night for the hearin so theres no perticlar hurry harry shall begin an ill chip in when he comes to the pickin up of me after id thinned down pretty nearly to a ghost  perhaps mr vandyne would have preferred to hear the story in fragments rather than at one sitting but bob was bent on spinning a yarn and as there was no practicable alternative he was forced to submit  harry began without delay jim and walter interrupting whenever he neglected to give all the details the old sailor then related the particulars of the involuntary cruise up to the time joe came aboard he in turn told of the disaster to the sea bird and bob finished the story which occupied considerably more than an hour in the telling  we shall have to let the crew know what youve got here although theres no necessity of explaining where or how it was found for they will be needed to take the bags aboard mr vandyne said after the lengthy yarn had been spun there is no danger for the schooner is commanded by a man in whom i have every confidence and there wont be a piece missing when we arrive in new york  now tell us how you knew where we were harry asked  the party who came in search of the murderers gave your written story to the newspapers in savannah and it was copied all over the country  then mr vandyne briefly related what had previously been done toward finding the boys  when the sally walker failed to return it was supposed she had been blown out to sea and every available craft was hired to search for the missing party when a week passed without the hopedfor result it seemed certain that all were dead and they were mourned for until the newspaper articles appeared  the remainder of the story was brief mr vandyne had just purchased the schooneryacht lorliethe same craft which was now hoveto off the keyand in her he started for the bahamas  what was the meaning of those pistolshots we heard sir joe asked they sounded like a fight rather than a signal  i wanted to let you understand we were coming and emptied my revolver at the same moment the captain did his there was considerable noise ill admit but knowing we should land in a few moments i paid little attention to it at the time  the sun was already sending forth heralds of his coming when the happy party exhausted their questions and explanations and half an hour later the lorlie was anchored in the cove with the five who had passed through so many adventures eating a hearty breakfast in her luxuriouslyfurnished cabin  after the meal had been concluded the work of taking the gold on board was begun and before nine oclock the yacht was slipping swiftly out of the harbor heading for nassau all her white sails filled by a strong northwesterly breeze  instead of going directly to new york it was mr vandynes intention to run down the shoal for the purpose of sending wreckers to the key in the hope of saving such cargo from the bonita as was on or near the island  the three boys were standing aft as she passed the point where walter had done duty as sentinel with such happy results and it was very difficult for either to restrain his joy at thus bidding adieu to the key  when i get my ship i wont come within a hundred miles of this place jim said emphatically and his companions were quite positive it would not give them any pleasure to return  swiftly the gallant yacht sped on bowing her long tapering spars to the ocean swell until the key was hardly more than a spot of blue on the horizon and the accidental cruise was wellnigh at an end     chapter xxxiii  nassau   the three boys and joe were given quarters in the yachts cabin but nothing mr vandyne could say would induce bob to remain aft  for an old shellback like me the only place is the focastle he said in reply to all their arguments it dont stand to reason that a sailor would be comfortable anywhere else an id be like a fish out of water if i couldnt go on watch with the others of my kind  but whats the use of working when father expects you to be his guest harry asked and bob replied with a hearty laugh  workin why its nothin moren the rarest kind of a lark to help handle a craft like this shes fitter for a gold frame an hung up as a ornament than to carry sich old barnacles as me bless you lad i wouldnt miss my trick at the wheel on a beauty like this any soonern id lose the gold weve had so much trouble in the savin  mr vandyne recognized the fact that the voyage would indeed be a disagreeable one to the old sailor if he was forced to play the part of passenger and nothing more was said on the subject although both harry and walter tried in vain many times afterward to coax him into the cabin at meal time  it may be supposed that the boys had experienced so many trials on the sea that they simply looked forward to being on land once more surrounded by the comforts of home but this was not so the lorlie was in every respect a beautiful craft and sailing in her was so different from what it had been on the brig that it seemed almost like another kind of traveling this in connection with the fact that all mental troubles were banished served to make the short trip to nassau most enjoyable  it would be necessary for mr vandyne to remain at this port two or three days in order to complete the preparations for saving the bonitas cargo but no one thought of taking up quarters on shore when it was possible to live so comfortably aboard the yacht  and now a word is necessary to explain why harrys father interested himself in this work which at first thought would seem too trifling to cause an extension of the cruise when mrs vandyne and mrs morse were anxiously waiting to greet once more the sons whom they had mourned as dead this explanation seems to be the final link in the chain of mysterious or unaccountable occurrences which went to make up the career of the runaway brig  mr vandyne owned onethird of the bonita and the first intimation he had of her abandonment was through the newspaper article which apprised him of his sons safety therefore his business in nassau was concerning the saving of his own property it did seem remarkable however that harry had been carried off by one of his fathers vessels which at the time was supposed to be halfway across the atlantic  i am confident that bobs theory as to the reason for her abandonment is the correct one mr vandyne said shortly after leaving the key when they were discussing the matter and my reason for the belief is founded on a similar accident which happened to one of the first vessels i ever owned she was bound to genoa from new orleans also with a cargo of alcohol one day during moderately fine weather there was a sudden explosion in the hold which burst the tarpaulin and shattered the hatch the captain saw dense volumes of what he thought smoke and ordered all hands to abandon ship they did get into the boats but before casting off had the same experience you had and the ship was saved in the bonitas case i have no doubt but that the boats foundered shortly after the crew left although possibly they were picked up by some outwardbound craft and we shall hear from them later  it was necessary for those who had been taken from the key to spend no small amount of time on shore giving evidence concerning the loss of the brig that there might be no delay regarding payment of the insurance and while attending to these matters they met an old acquaintance to whom they were deeply indebted  this was none other than the captain of the schooner which had visited the island in search of the murderers and who gave the information leading to their rescue  i was jes thinkin id run across the shoals an see how you was gettin on he said after a hearty greeting but i reckoned you had the steamer patched up before i got back from the states  joe related briefly their misadventures on the key and also the particulars of the rescue concluding by asking if the rednosed man and his companions had been captured  im mighty glad that what we did in savannah brought your friends on id been blamin myself for not stoppin here when we come back but as things turned out a delay of two hours would a given them villains the chance of showin us their heels  then you caught em bob asked eagerly  thats jes what we did an no mistake though it was a close shave we was comin down past egg key with a full breeze when i saw a yawl edgin inshore like as if her crew wanted to get out of sight none of us expected that gang was aboard knowin as how theyd stole your brig but i thought it wouldnt do any harm to cut in between them and the land two hours later an theyd a been on the shoals where we couldnt follow  did they show fight bob asked  they attempted to but we was fixed for jes sich a crowd when we hoveto not fifty yards off an showed the muzzles of half a dozen rifles every one of em quieted down like lambs we clapped irons on the gang an next day they were here in jail it was hard work to prove the murder on em although everybody knew they did it they were sentenced yesterday to twenty years imprisonment an us who live around here feel a good deal more easy in mind because it wasnt safe for a man to travel very far alone while they were free  then the captain insisted on the boys going with him to the coralreefs where the spongers were at work and a very pleasant afternoon did they spend  there were to be seen by aid of a glass sponges of all varieties from the sheeps wool and velvet to the bright scarlet gloves which grow in the shape of huge hands and owe their peculiar color to the insects which build them reefsponges yet covered with their manufacturers and black as a coal wire sponges and gray ones fashioned in the form of a cup sponges of all shapes and hues until the shoal looked like a garden of brilliantlycolored flowers which had been suddenly inundated  the boys collected a huge store of curious things among which was no small amount of purple and yellow fans stars and trees of coral which is so much more beautiful when living and in the sea than the dried specimens we see on land  the days pleasuring was brought to a close by a visit to the spongeyard where the captains guests learned very much about this branch of industry which in the bahamas alone gives employment to several thousand persons and five or six hundred vessels  it was very like a revelation to them when the hospitable captain explained that there were several grades of each variety of sheepwool whitereef darkreef abaco velvet grass boat hardhead yellow and glove sponges all worth from five to ten cents per pound by the quantity and also that when first taken from the water a sponge is useless for mechanical or domestic purposes  probably every boy knows that a sponge as we see it is only the skeleton of an organism when first gathered it is covered with a thick black gelatinous substance which must be removed then it is sorted clipped soaked in limewater and dried in the sun before being compressed into hundredpound packages  it would be impossible to learn all that is really interesting concerning the sponge in one short article or during a single visit to the yards and jim was so impressed with this fact that he said to harry when the latter hurried him away because the yachts boat was waiting for them  the first thing i buy out of my share of the money will be a book about these things an then ill know a good deal more than i do now  on the third day after their arrival the boys saw a freightingschooner with a large crew of men set sail for the key on which they had lived so long to save what was left of the bonita and her cargo  this completed the business for which they had visited nassauthe wreckers being instructed to carry their find to new yorkand word was given that every one should be ready for an early start homeward next morning  youve had adventures enough for one year and can well afford to study hard until next summer mr vandyne said as he announced the early departure of the lorlie and hearing the words a troubled look came over jims face  were ready for any amount of work at school after our accidental cruise harry replied promptly but what is to become of jim  he will go home of course after receiving his share of the pirates treasure  but he hasnt a relative in the world and it seems too bad for him to go on board the mary walker now that he has money enough to pay for a good education  mr vandyne questioned the young fisherman at great length and then he said  you will be able to do as you choose because the accidental cruise has made all hands moderately wealthy therefore i am not offering anything like charity when i say you can live with harry until some permanent arrangement is made we will have a legal guardian appointed that the money shall not be squandered and you need not feel much anxiety as to the future until the time comes when you decide upon an occupation  jim tried to thank mr vandyne but failed signally and to hide his confusion he scuttled off to the forecastle where he told bob the good news concluding by saying  im through bein ropesended by a crew of fishermen whenever they feel a little grouty an you jes bet ill study hard now ive got a chance but how will i ever see you agin  why bless you lad im goin to stay close round theresorter in the same family mr vandyne is a shipowner an has plenty of work for an old shellback like me joe an i have both signed with him an whenever you want to know anything what cant be found in books jes shape a course for the docks an ask bob brace     chapter xxxiv  new york   of the voyage to new york it is hardly necessary to speak because nothing of an exciting or an interesting nature occurred the wind favored the lorlie to such an extent that not a rope was started from the time of leaving nassau until she crossed the bar at sandy hook the trip was as devoid of incident as the previous one in the bonita had been filled with dangers and sorrows and two hours after the yacht dropped anchor off staten island harry and walter were clasped in their mothers arms  the accidental cruise in a runaway brig was ended at last and fortunately no harm had come from what at one time seemed certain would be attended with gravest dangers  it only remains now to chronicle the events which immediately followed their arrival not because of any relation to the story already told but owing to the influence they may exercise upon the future movements of the three boys  first and at present the most important is how much treasure did they bring home  mr vandyne was forced to engage the services of an expert moneychanger in order to learn this fact himself and to the surprise of all it was found that the bags averaged a trifle more than eighteen thousand dollars apiece making a grand total of three hundred and fortytwo thousand six hundred dollars this was divided equally among the five who had been imprisoned on the key and for the first time in his life bob brace enjoyed the distinction of being what he called a blooming capitalist  it was no longer necessary for either the old sailor or joe to do any very hard work but as both preferred some kind of employment and that which mr vandyne offered was exactly suited to their ideas of ease if not luxury they concluded to hold to the agreement already made  while the money was being divided bob insisted very strongly that harrys father should take a certain amount to repay him for the voyage to the bahamas but this was refused in such a decided manner as to leave no opportunity for discussion  the treasure belongs to those who found it the merchant said and as i made the trip for the purpose of rescuing my son there can be no question of payment yet i did have a reasonably profitable cruise in addition to finding harry you were able to prove the loss of the bonita thus giving me an opportunity of claiming the insurance many months sooner than it could otherwise have been done and besides i am expecting to realize something from salvage on the cargo  bob and joe decided to invest a portion of their share of the treasure in a vessel and mr vandyne agreed to act as their agent in the transaction  three days after the arrival of the lorlie the rescued party were engaged in their business or pleasure much as if they had never seen an island on the bahama shoal  jim was living at harrys home and mr vandyne was to be his guardian as soon as the necessary formalities could he complied with walter was at home within a block of his friend while the other two members of the party who had taken an accidental cruise were busily engaged in mr vandynes service  on the fourth day after the lorlie cast anchor off staten island the three boys went to the docks for the purpose of paying bob and joe a visit and then the old sailor proposed such a scheme as met with the unqualified approval of all  i want you lads to look at a little steam yacht thats layin at the next pier bob said and as a matter of course the boys were more than willing to make such inspection since after their late experience anything in the way of boats or vessels had a new interest for them  the craft to which bob and joe led the party fully merited the praise which was bestowed so unstintedly her name was the sea foam and she lie so jauntily on the water that one could but say it was in every way applicable to her  fiftyfive foot keel nine foot beam compound engines sound as a dollar and guaranteed to make fourteen knots an hour joe said as he pointed to the little steamer shes the most perfect thing of her kind i ever saw  the boys were not satisfied with gazing at her from the pier but clambered on board and a view of her interior arrangements only served to strengthen the good opinion formed by a single glance at the graceful lines of the hull  the sea foam had a roomy aftercabin handsomely but not expensively furnished on either side of which were four bunks separated from the saloon by heavy draperies swinging lamps and trays large mirrors the polished woods and the shining metalwork gave an air of beauty and homeliness to this portion of the steamer such as the boys thought very charming  then the engineroom was visited and although the three younger members of the party were not judges of machinery they could understand that joes words of praise were merited  the forward cabin which also served as diningroom contained four bunks and leading from it was as complete and convenient a galley and pantry as the most fastidious cook could have desired  well what do you think of her bob asked when the inspection was concluded  shes the handsomest craft i ever saw harry replied enthusiastically who owns her  a gentleman whose office is near your fathers and he wants to sell her shes cheap at the pricethree thousandand my idea is that you boys couldnt do better than buy her then next summer when you want to go off on a good time joell ship as engineer ill be crew an youll only need a cook she looks like a firstclass seaboat fit for any water  it is needless to add that the boys were highly excited by this proposition but as it was impossible to say that the purchase could be made until mr vandyne and mr morse had been consulted harry and walter started for the formers office at full speed leaving the remainder of the party on board until their return  want to buy the sea foam eh mr vandyne said when harry pantingly asked him to come and look at the little steamer i examined her yesterday and thought she would be a good pleasureboat for you boys considering the fact that youve got more than money enough to make the purchase i see no good reason why it shouldnt be done ill send a note to the owner and you had better run down the bay on a trial trip tell bob and joe to stop work and go with you remember that while on the yacht the old sailor is to be obeyed as he was at the island  to get an order for the dockmaster to deliver the sea foam to the parties named in mr vandynes note it was only necessary to walk a short distance and in less than an hour after first seeing the yacht all hands were on board steaming down the bay at a trifle more than a fifteenknot rate  one trip was sufficient to convince the boys that the little craft was essential to their happiness and even bob and joe were so pleased with her that it is quite probable they might have been tempted to purchase her themselves in case the young capitalists had not decided in favor of the scheme  a twoweeksold baby might steer her if it knew enough bob said approvingly as he stood at the wheel in the snug little pilothouse an as for speed why theres mighty few can touch her were gettin a decently heavy swell now an her deck is as dry as a bone  would you dare to go from here to the bahamas in her walter asked  dare why lad shed live in weather that would swamp many a bigger craft you can cruise from here to south america in her an be a blessed sight more comfortable than ever we were on the old bonita  joe had even more to say in the sea foams favor than bob and he insisted stoutly that it was nothing more than play to act the part of engineer  all this praise was needless however for the intending purchasers were more than pleased with the little craft and their report to mr vandyne was coupled with such urgent entreaties for him to close the bargain before any one else could take advantage of the offer that by noon of the next day she was transferred to messrs vandyne morse  libby  these young gentlemen are already making preparations to spend next summer on board the sea foam and when they start it is safe to say the cruise will not be accidental     the end
