98793571	history of king charles the second of england  by jacob abbott     preface    the author of this series has made it his special object to confine himself very strictly even in the most minute details which he records to historic truth the narratives are not tales founded upon history but history itself without any embellishment or any deviations from the strict truth so far as it can now be discovered by an attentive examination of the annals written at the time when the events themselves occurred in writing the narratives the author has endeavored to avail himself of the best sources of information which this country affords and though of course there must be in these volumes as in all historical accounts more or less of imperfection and error there is no intentional embellishment nothing is stated not even the most minute and apparently imaginary details without what was deemed good historical authority the readers therefore may rely upon the record as the truth and nothing but the truth so far as an honest purpose and a careful examination have been effectual in ascertaining it     contents    chapter     i infancy    ii prince charless mother   iii queen henriettas

of charles that have appeared thus far in the line of english sovereigns nor is it very probable that there will soon be another the reigns of both these monarchs were stained and tarnished with many vices and crimes and darkened by national disasters of every kind and the name is thus connected with so many painful associations in the minds of men that it seems to have been dropped by common consent in all branches of the royal family  the reign of charles the first as will be seen by the history of his life in this series was characterized by a long and obstinate contest between the king and the people which brought on at last a civil war in which the king was defeated and taken prisoner and in the end beheaded on a block before one of his own palaces during the last stages of this terrible contest and before charles way himself taken prisoner he was as it were a fugitive and an outlaw in his own dominions his wife and family were scattered in various foreign lands his cities and castles were in the hands of his enemies and his oldest son the prince charles was the object of special hostility the prince incurred therefore a great many dangers and suffered many heavy calamities in his early years he lived to see these calamities pass away and after they were gone he enjoyed so far as his own personal safety and welfare were concerned a tranquil and prosperous life the storm however of trial and suffering which enveloped the evening of his fathers days darkened the morning of his own the life of charles the first was a river rising gently from quiet springs in a scene of verdure and sunshine and flowing gradually into rugged and gloomy regions where at last it falls into a terrific abyss enveloped in darkness and storms that of charles the second on the other hand rising in the wild and rugged mountains where the parent stream was engulfed commences its course by leaping frightfully from precipice to precipice with turbid and foaming waters but emerges at last into a smooth and smiling land and flows through it prosperously to the sea  prince charless mother the wife of charles the first was a french princess her name was henrietta maria she was unaccomplished beautiful and very spirited woman she was a catholic and the english people who were very decided in their hostility to the catholic faith were extremely jealous of her they watched all her movements with the utmost suspicion they were very unwilling that an heir to the crown should arise in her family the animosity which they felt against her husband the king which was becoming every day more and more bitter seemed to be doubly inveterate and intense toward her they published pamphlets in which they called her a daughter of heth a canaanite and an idolatress and expressed hopes that from such a worse than pagan stock no progeny should ever spring  henrietta was at this time1630twentyone years of age and had been married about four years she had had one son who had died a few days after his birth of course she did not lead a very happy life in england her husband the king like the majority of the english people was a protestant and the difference was a far more important circumstance in those days than it would be now though even now a difference in religious faith on points which either party deems essential is in married life an obstacle to domestic happiness which comes to no termination and admits of no cure if it were possible for reason and reflection to control the impetuous impulses of youthful hearts such differences of religious faith would be regarded where they exist as an insurmountable objection to a matrimonial union  the queen made thus unhappy by religious dissensions with her husband and by the public odium of which she was the object lived in considerable retirement and seclusion at st jamess palace in westminster which is the western part of london here her second son the subject of this history was born in may 1630 which was ten years after the landing of the pilgrims on the plymouth rock the babe was very far from being pretty though he grew up at last to be quite a handsome man king charles was very much pleased at the birth of his son he rode into london the next morning at the head of a long train of guards and noble attendants to the great cathedral church of st pauls to render thanks publicly to god for the birth of his child and the safety of the queen while this procession was going through the streets all london being out to gaze upon it the attention of the vast crowd was attracted to the appearance of a star glimmering faintly in the sky at midday this is an occurrence not very uncommon though it seldom perhaps occurs when it has so many observers to witness it the star was doubtless venus which in certain circumstances is often bright enough to be seen when the sun is above the horizon the populace of london however who were not in those days very profound astronomers regarded the shining of the star as a supernatural occurrence altogether and as portending the future greatness and glory of the prince whose natal day it thus unexpectedly adorned  preparations were made for the baptism of the young prince in july the baptism of a prince is an important affair and there was one circumstance which gave a peculiar interest to that of the infant charles the reformation had not been long established in england and this happened to be the first occasion on which an heir to the english crown had been baptized since the liturgy of the english church had been arranged there is a chapel connected with the palace of st james as is usual with royal palaces in europe and even in fact with the private castles and mansions of the higher nobility the baptism took place there on such occasions it is usual for certain persons to appear as sponsors as they are called who undertake to answer for the safe and careful instruction of the child in the principles of the christian faith this is of course mainly a form the real function of the sponsors being confined as it would appear to making magnificent presents to their young godchild in acknowledgment of the distinguished honor conferred upon them by their designation to the office which they hold the sponsors on this occasion were certain royal personages in france the relatives of the queen they could not appear personally and so they appointed proxies from among the higher nobility of england who appeared at the baptism in their stead and made the presents to the child one of these proxies was a duchess whose gift was a jewel valued at a sum in english money equal to thirty thousand dollars  the oldest son of a king of england receives the title of prince of wales and there was an ancient custom of the realm that an infant prince of wales should be under the care in his earliest years of a welsh nurse so that the first words which he should learn to speak might be the vernacular language of his principality such a nurse was provided for charles rockers for his cradle were appointed and many other officers of his household all the arrangements being made in a very magnificent and sumptuous manner it is the custom in england to pay fees to the servants by which a lady or gentleman is attended even when a guest in private dwellings and some idea may be formed of the scale on which the pageantry of this occasion was conducted from the fact that one of the lady sponsors who rode to the palace in the queens carriage which was sent for her on this occasion paid a sum equal to fifty dollars each to six running footmen who attended the carriage and a hundred dollars to the coachman while a number of knights who came on horseback and in armor to attend upon the carriage as it moved to the palace received each a gratuity of two hundred and fifty dollars the state dresses on the occasion of this baptism were very costly and splendid being of white satin trimmed with crimson  the little prince was thus an object of great attention at the very commencement of his days his mother had his portrait painted and sent it to her mother in france she did not however in the letters which accompanied the picture though his mother praise the beauty of her child she said in fact that he was so ugly that she was ashamed of him though his size and plumpness she added atoned for the want of beauty and then he was so comically serious and grave in the expression of his countenance the queen said she verily believed that he was wiser than herself  as the young prince advanced in years the religious and political difficulties in the english nation increased and by the time that he had arrived at an age when he could begin to receive impressions from the conversation and intercourse of those around him the parliament began to be very jealous of the influence which his mother might exert they were extremely anxious that he should be educated a protestant and were very much afraid that his mother would contrive to initiate him secretly into the ideas and practices of the catholic faith  she insisted that she did not attempt to do this and perhaps she did not but in those days it was often considered right to make false pretensions and to deceive so far as this was necessary to promote the cause of true religion the queen did certainly make some efforts to instill catholic principles into the minds of some of her children for she had other children after the birth of charles she gave a daughter a crucifix one day which is a little image of christ upon the cross made usually of ivory or silver or gold and also a rosary which is a string of beads by means of which the catholics are assisted to count their prayers henrietta gave these things to her daughter secretly and told her to hide them in her pocket and taught her how to use them the parliament considered such attempts to influence the minds of the royal children as very heinous sins and they made such arrangements for secluding the young prince charles from his mother and putting the others under the guidance of protestant teachers and governors as very much interfered with henriettas desires to enjoy the society of her children since england was a protestant realm a catholic lady in marrying an english king ought not to have expected perhaps to have been allowed to bring up her children in her own faith still it must have been very hard for a mother to be forbidden to teach her own children what she undoubtedly believed was the only possible means of securing for them the favor and protection of heaven  there is in london a vast storehouse of books manuscripts relics curiosities pictures and other memorials of bygone days called the british museum among the old records here preserved are various letters written by henrietta and one or two by charles the young prince during his childhood here is one for instance written by henrietta to her child when the little prince was but eight years of age chiding him for not being willing to take his medicine he was at that time under the charge of lord newcastle  charlesi am sorry that i must begin my first letter with chiding you because i hear that you will not take phisicke i hope it was onlie for this day and that tomorrow you will do it for if you will not i must come to you and make you take it for it is for your health i have given order to mi lord of newcastle to send mi word tonight whether you will or not therefore i hope you will not give me the paines to goe and so i rest your affectionate mother                                        henriette marie  the letter was addressed  to mi deare sonne the prince  the queen must have taken special pains with this her first letter to her son for with all its faults of orthography it is very much more correct than most of the epistles which she attempted to write in english she was very imperfectly acquainted with the english language using as she almost always did in her domestic intercourse her own native tongue  time passed on and the difficulties and contests between king charles and his people and parliament became more and more exciting and alarming one after another of the kings most devoted and faithful ministers was arrested tried condemned and beheaded notwithstanding all the efforts which their sovereign master could make to save them parties were formed and party spirit ran very high tumults were continually breaking out about the palaces which threatened the personal safety of the king and queen henrietta herself was a special object of the hatred which these outbreaks expressed the king himself was half distracted by the overwhelming difficulties of his position bad as it was in england it was still worse in scotland there was an actual rebellion there and the urgency of the danger in that quarter was so great that charles concluded to go there leaving the poor queen at home to take care of herself and her little ones as well as she could with the few remaining means of protection yet left at her disposal  there was an ancient mansion called oatlands not very far from london where the queen generally resided during the absence of her husband it was a lonely place on low and level ground and surrounded by moats filled with water over which those who wished to enter passed by draw bridges henrietta chose this place for her residence because she thought she should be safer there from mobs and violence she kept the children all there except the prince of wales who was not allowed to be wholly under her care he how ever often visited his mother and she sometimes visited him  during the absence of her husband queen henrietta was subjected to many severe and heavy trials her communications with him were often interrupted and broken she felt a very warm interest in the prosperity and success of his expedition and sometimes the tidings she received from him encouraged her to hope that all might yet be well here for instance is a note which she addressed one day to an officer who had sent her a letter from the king that had come enclosed to him it is written in a broken english which shows how imperfectly the foreign lady had learned the language of her adopted country they who understand the french language will be interested in observing that most of the errors which the writer falls into are those which result naturally from the usages of her mother tongue  queen henrietta to sir edward nicholas  maistre nicholasi have reseaved your letter and that you send me from the king which writes me word he as been vere well reseaved in scotland that both the armi and the people have shewed a creat joy to see the king and such that theay say was never seen before pray god it may continue                                    your friend henriette marie r  at one time during the kings absence in scotland the parliament threatened to take the queens children all away from her for fear as they said that she would make papists of them this danger alarmed and distressed the queen exceedingly she declared that she did not intend or desire to bring up her children in the catholic faith she knew this was contrary to the wish of the king her husband as well as of the people of england in order to diminish the danger that the children would be taken away she left oatlands herself and went to reside at other palaces only going occasionally to visit her children though she was thus absent from them in person her heart was with them all the time and she was watching with great solicitude and anxiety for any indications of a design on the part of her enemies to come and take them away  at last she received intelligence that an armed force was ordered to assemble one night in the vicinity of oatlands to seize her children under the pretext that the queen was herself forming plans for removing them out of the country and taking them to france henrietta was a lady of great spirit and energy and this threatened danger to her children aroused all her powers she sent immediately to all the friends about her on whom she could rely and asked them to come armed and equipped and with as many followers as they could muster to the park at oatlands that night there were also then in and near london a number of officers of the army absent from their posts on furlough she sent similar orders to these all obeyed the summons with eager alacrity the queen mustered and armed her own household too down to the lowest servants of the kitchen by these means quite a little army was collected in the park at oatlands the separate parties coming in one after another in the evening and night this guard patrolled the grounds till morning the queen herself animating them by her presence and energy the children whom the excited mother was thus guarding like a lioness defending her young were all the time within the mansion awaiting in infantile terror some dreadful calamity they scarcely knew what which all this excitement seemed to portend  the names and ages of the queens children at this time were as follows  charles prince of wales the subject of this story eleven  mary ten young as she was she was already married having been espoused a short time before to william prince of orange who was one year older than herself  james duke of york seven he became afterward king james ii  elizabeth six  henry an infant only a few months old  the night passed away without any attack though a considerable force assembled in the vicinity which was however soon after disbanded the queens fears were nevertheless not allayed she began to make arrangements for escaping from the kingdom in ease it should become necessary to do so she sent a certain faithful friend and servant to portsmouth with orders to get some vessels ready so that she could fly there with her children and embark at a moments notice if these dangers and alarms should continue  she did not however have occasion to avail herself of these preparations affairs seemed to take a more favorable turn the king came back from scotland he was received by his people on his arrival with apparent cordiality and good will the queen was of course rejoiced to welcome him home and she felt relieved and protected by his presence the city of london which had been the main seat of disaffection and hostility to the royal family began to show symptoms of returning loyalty and friendly regard in reciprocation for this the king determined on making a grand entry into the city to pay a sort of visit to the authorities he rode on this occasion in a splendid chariot of state with the little prince by his side queen henrietta came next in an open carriage of her own and the other children with other carriages followed in the train a long cortege of guards and attendants richly dressed and magnificently mounted preceded and followed the royal family while the streets were lined with thousands of spectators who waved handkerchiefs and banners and shouted god save the king in the midst of this scene of excitement and triumph henrietta rode quietly along her anxieties relieved her sorrows and trials ended and her heart bounding with happiness and hope she was once more as she conceived reunited to her husband and her children and reconciled to the people of her realm she thought her troubles were over alas they had on the contrary scarcely begun     chapter ii  prince charless mother    the indications and promises of returning peace and happiness which gave prince charless mother so much animation and hope after the return of her husband from scotland were all very superficial and fallacious the real grounds of the quarrel between the king and his parliament and of the feelings of alienation and ill will cherished toward the queen were all unfortunately as deep and extensive as ever and the storm which lulled treacherously for a little time broke forth soon afterward anew with a frightful violence which it was evident that nothing could withstand this new onset of disaster and calamity was produced in such a way that henrietta had to reproach herself with being the cause of its coming  she had often represented to the king that in her opinion one main cause of the difficulties he had suffered was that he did not act efficiently and decidedly and like a man in putting down the opposition manifested against him on the part of his subjects and now soon after his return from scotland on some new spirit of disaffection showing itself in parliament she urged him to act at once energetically and promptly against it she proposed to him to take an armed force with him and proceed boldly to the halls where the parliament was assembled and arrest the leaders of the party who were opposed to him there were five of them who were specially prominent the queen believed that if these five men were seized and imprisoned in the tower the rest would be intimidated and overawed and the monarchs lost authority and power would be restored again  the king was persuaded partly by the dictates of his own judgment and partly by the urgency of the queen to make the attempt the circumstances of this case so far as the action of the king was concerned in them are fully related in the history of charles the first here we have only to speak of the queen who was left in a state of great suspense and anxiety in her palace at whitehall while her husband was gone on his dangerous mission  the plan of the king to make this irruption into the great legislative assembly of the nation had been kept so they supposed a very profound secret lest the members whom he was going to arrest should receive warning of their danger and fly when the time arrived the king bade henrietta farewell saying that she might wait there an hour and if she received no ill news from him during that time she might be sure that he had been successful and that he was once more master of his kingdom the queen remained in the apartment where the king had left her looking continually at the watch which she held before her and counting the minutes impatiently as the hands moved slowly on she had with her one confidential friend the lady carlisle who sat with her and seemed to share her solicitude though she had not been entrusted with the secret the time passed on no ill tidings came and at length the hour fully expired and henrietta able to contain herself no longer exclaimed with exultation rejoice with me the hour is gone from this time my husband is master of his realm his enemies in parliament are all arrested before this time and his kingdom is henceforth his own  it certainly is possible for kings and queens to have faithful friends but there are so many motives and inducements to falsehood and treachery in court that it is not possible generally for them to distinguish false friends from true the lady carlisle was a confederate with some of the very men whom charles had gone to arrest on receiving this intimation of their danger she sent immediately to the houses of parliament which were very near at hand and the obnoxious members received warning in time to fly the hour had indeed elapsed but the king had met with several unexpected delays both in his preparations for going and on his way to the house of commons so that when at last he entered the members were gone his attempt however unsuccessful as it was evoked a general storm of indignation and anger producing thus all the exasperation which was to have been expected from the measure without in any degree accomplishing its end the poor queen was overwhelmed with confusion and dismay when she learned the result she had urged her husband forward to an extremely dangerous and desperate measure and then by her thoughtless indiscretion had completely defeated the end a universal and utterly uncontrollable excitement burst like a clap of thunder upon the country as this outrage as they termed it of the king became known and the queen was utterly appalled at the extent and magnitude of the mischief she had done  the mischief was irremediable the spirit of resentment and indignation which the kings action had aroused expressed itself in such tumultuous and riotous proceedings as to render the continuance of the royal family in london no longer safe they accordingly removed up the river to hampton court a famous palace on the thames not many miles from the city there they remained but a very short time the dangers which beset them were evidently increasing it was manifest that the king must either give up what he deemed the just rights and prerogatives of the crown or prepare to maintain them by war the queen urged him to choose the latter alternative to raise the means for doing this she proposed that she should herself leave the country taking with her her jewels and such other articles of great value as could be easily carried away and by means of them and her personal exertions raise funds and forces to aid her husband in the approaching struggle  the king yielded to the necessity which seemed to compel the adoption of this plan he accordingly set off to accompany henrietta to the shore she took with her the young princess mary in fact the ostensible object of her journey was to convey her to her young husband the prince of orange in holland in such infantile marriages as theirs it is not customary though the marriage ceremony be performed for the wedded pair to live together till they arrive at years a little more mature  the queen was to embark at dover dover was in those days the great port of egress from england to the continent there was and is still a great castle on the cliffs to guard the harbor and the town these cliffs are picturesque and high falling off abruptly in chalky precipices to the sea among them at one place is a sort of dell by which there is a gradual descent to the water king charles stood upon the shore when henrietta sailed away watching the ship as it receded from his view with tears in his eyes with all the faults characteristic of her nation which henrietta possessed she was now his best and truest friend and when she was gone he felt that he was left desolate and alone in the midst of the appalling dangers by which he was environed  the king went back to hampton court parliament sent him a request that he would come and reside nearer to the capital and enjoined upon him particularly not to remove the young prince of wales in the mean time they began to gather together their forces and to provide munitions of war the king did the same he sent the young prince to the western part of the kingdom and retired himself to the northward to the city of york which he made his headquarters in a word both parties prepared for war  in the mean time queen henrietta was very successful in her attempts to obtain aid for her husband in holland her misfortunes awakened pity with which through her beauty and the graces of her conversation and address there was mingled a feeling analogous to love then besides there was something in her spirit of earnest and courageous devotion to her husband in the hours of his calamity that won for her a strong degree of admiration and respect  there are no efforts which are so efficient and powerful in the accomplishment of their end as those which a faithful wife makes to rescue and save her husband the heart generally so timid seems to be inspired on such occasions with a preternatural courage and the arm at other times so feeble and helpless is nerved with unexpected strength every one is ready to second and help such efforts and she who makes them is surprised at her success and wonders at the extent and efficiency of the powers which she finds herself so unexpectedly able to wield  the queen interested all classes in holland in her plans and by her personal credit and the security of her diamonds and rubies she borrowed large sums of money from the government from the banks and from private merchants the sums which she thus raised amounted to two millions of pounds sterling equal to nearly ten millions of dollars while these negotiations were going on she remained in holland with her little daughter the bride under her care whose education she was carrying forward all the time with the help of suitable masters for though married mary was yet a child the little husband was going on at the same time with his studies too  henrietta remained in holland a year she expended a part of her money in purchasing military stores and supplies for her husband and then set sail with them and with the money not expended to join the king the voyage was a very extraordinary one a great gale of wind began to blow from the northeast soon after the ships left the port which increased in violence for nine days until at length the sea was lashed to such a state of fury that the company lost all hope of ever reaching the land the queen had with her a large train of attendants both ladies and gentlemen and there were also in her suit a number of catholic priests who always accompanied her as the chaplains and confessors of her household these persons had all been extremely sick and had been tied into their beds on account of the excessive rolling of the ship and their own exhaustion and helplessness the danger increased until at last it became so extremely imminent that all the selfpossession of the passengers was entirely gone in such protracted storms the surges of the sea strike the ship with terrific force and vast volumes of water fall heavily upon the decks threatening instant destructionthe ship plunging awfully after the shock as if sinking to rise no more at such moments the noble ladies who accompanied the queen on this voyage would be overwhelmed with terror and they filled the cabins with their shrieks of dismay all this time the queen herself was quiet and composed she told the ladies not to fear for queens of england were never drowned  at one time when the storm was at its height the whole party were entirely overwhelmed with consternation and terror two of the ships were engulfed and lost the queens company thought that their own was sinking they came crowding into the cabin where the priests were lying sick and helpless and began all together to confess their sins to them in the catholic mode eager in these their last moments as they supposed to relieve their consciences in any way from the burdens of guilt which oppressed them the queen herself did not participate in these fears she ridiculed the absurd confessions and rebuked the senseless panic to which the terrified penitents were yielding and whenever any mitigation of the violence of the gale made it possible to do any thing to divert the minds of her company she tried to make amusement out of the odd and strange dilemmas in which they were continually placed and the ludicrous disasters and accidents which were always befalling her servants and officers of state in their attempts to continue the etiquette and ceremony proper in attendance upon a queen and from which even the violence of such a storm and the imminence of such danger could not excuse them after a fortnight of danger terror and distress the ships that remained of the little squadron succeeded in getting back to the port from which they had sailed  the queen however did not despair after a few days of rest and refreshment she set sail again though it was now in the dead of winter the result of this second attempt was a prosperous voyage and the little fleet arrived in due time at burlington on the english coast where the queen landed her money and her stores she had however after all a very narrow escape for she was very closely pursued on her voyage by an english squadron they came into port the night after she had landed and the next morning she was awakened by the crashing of cannon balls and the bursting of bomb shells in the houses around her and found on hastily rising that the village was under a bombardment from the ships of her enemies she hurried on some sort of dress and sallied forth with her attendants to escape into the fields this incident is related fully in the history of her husband charles the first but there is one circumstance not there detailed which illustrates very strikingly that strange combination of mental greatness and energy worthy of a queen with a simplicity of affections and tastes which we should scarcely expect in a child that marked henriettas character she had a small dog its name was mike they say it was an ugly little animal too in all eyes but her own this dog accompanied her on the voyage and landed with her on the english shore on the morning however when she fled from her bed to escape from the balls and bomb shells of the english ships she recollected after getting a short distance from the house that mike was left behind she immediately returned ran up to her chamber again seized mike who was sleeping unconsciously upon her bed and bore the little pet away from the scene of ruin which the balls and bursting shells were making all astonished no doubt at so hurried and violent an abduction the party gained the open fields and seeking shelter in a dry trench which ran along the margin of a field they crouched there together till the commander of the ships was tired of firing  the queens destination was york the great and ancient capital of the north of england york was the head quarters of king charless army though he himself was not there at this time as soon as news of the queens arrival reached york the general in command there sent down to the coast a detachment of two thousand men to escort the heroine and the stores and money which she had brought to her husbands capital at the head of this force she marched in triumph across the country with a long train of ordnance and baggage wagons loaded with supplies there were six pieces of cannon and two hundred and fifty wagons loaded with the money which she had obtained in holland the whole country was excited with enthusiasm at the spectacle the enthusiasm was increased by the air and bearing of the queen who proud and happy at this successful result of all her dangers and toils rode on horseback at the head of her army like a general spoke frankly to the soldiers sought no shelter from the sun and rain and ate her meals like the rest of the army in a bivouac in the open field she had been the means in some degree of leading the king into his difficulties by the too vigorous measures she had urged him to take in the case of the attempted parliamentary arrest she seems to have been determined to make that spirit of resolution and energy in her which caused the mischief then atone for it by its efficient usefulness now she stopped on her march to summon and take a town which had been hitherto in the hands of her husbands enemies adding thus the glory of a conquest to the other triumphs of the day  in fact the queens heart was filled with pride and pleasure at this conclusion of her enterprise as is very manifest from the frequent letters which she wrote to her husband at the time the kings cause revived they gradually approached each other in the operations which they severally conducted until at last the king after a great and successful battle set off at the head of a large escort to come and meet his wife they met in the vale of keynton near edgehill which is on the southern borders of warwickshire near the center of the island the meeting was of course one of the greatest excitement and pleasure charles praised the high courage and faithful affection of his devoted wife and she was filled with happiness in enjoying the love and gratitude of her husband  the pressure of outward misfortune and calamity has always the same strong tendency as was manifest in this case to invigorate anew all the ties of conjugal and domestic affection and thus to create the happiness which it seems to the world to destroy in the early part of charles and henriettas married life while every thing external went smoothly and prosperously with them they were very far from being happy they destroyed each others peace by petty disputes and jars about things of little consequence in which they each had scarcely any interest except a desire to carry the point and triumph over the other king charles himself preserved a record of one of these disputes the queen had received at the time of her marriage certain estates consisting of houses and lands the income of which was to be at her disposal and she wished to appoint certain treasurers to take charge of this property she had made out a list of these officers in consultation with her mother she gave this list to charles one night after he was himself in bed he said he would look at it in the morning but that she must remember that by the marriage treaty he was to appoint those officers she said in reply that a part of those whom she had named were english the king said that he would look at the paper in the morning and such of the english names as he approved he would confirm but that he could not appoint any frenchmen the queen answered that she and her mother had selected the men whom she had named and she would not have any body else charles rejoined that the business was not either in her power or her mothers and if she relied on such an influence to effect her wishes he would not appoint any body that she recommended the queen was very much hurt at this and began to be angry she said that if she could not put in whom she chose to have the care of her property she would not have any such property he might take back her houses and lands and allow her what he pleased in money in its stead charles replied by telling her to remember whom she was speaking to that he could not be treated in that manner and then the queen giving way to lamentations and tears said she was wretched and miserable every thing that she wanted was denied her and whatever she recommended was refused on the very account of her recommendation charles tried to speak but she would not hear she went on with her lamentations and complaints interrupted only by her own sobs of passion and grief  the reader may perhaps imagine that this must have been an extreme and unusual instance of dissension between this royal pair but it was not cases of far greater excitement and violence sometimes occurred the french servants and attendants whom the queen very naturally preferred and upon whom the king was as naturally inclined to look with suspicion and ill will were a continual source of disagreement between them at last one afternoon the king happening to come into that part of the palace at whitehall where the queens apartments were situated and which was called the queens side found there a number of her gentlemen and lady attendants in a great frolic capering and dancing in a way which the gay frenchmen probably considered nothing extraordinary but which king charles regarded as very irreverent and unsuitable conduct to be witnessed in the presence of an english queen he was very much displeased he advanced to henrietta took her by the arm conducted her sternly to his own side of the palace brought her into one of his own apartments and locked the door he then sent an officer to direct all the french servants and attendants in the queens apartments to leave the palace immediately and repair to somerset house which was not far distant and remain there till they received further orders the officer executed these commands in a very rough manner the french women shrieked and cried and filled the court yard of the palace with their clamor but the officer paid no regard to this noise he turned them all out of the apartments and locked the doors after them  the queen was rendered quite frantic with vexation and rage at these proceedings she flew to the windows to see and to bid farewell to her friends and to offer them expressions of her sympathy the king pulled her away telling her to be quiet and submit for he was determined that they should go the queen was determined that she would not submit she attempted to open the windows the king held them down excited now to a perfect frenzy in the struggle she began to break out the panes with her fist while charles exerted all his force to restrain and confine her by grasping her wrists and endeavoring to force her away what a contrast between the low and sordid selfishness and jealousy evinced in such dissensions as these and the lofty and heroic devotedness and fidelity which this wife afterward evinced for her husband in the harassing cares the stormy voyages and the martial exposures and fatigues which she endured for his sake and yet notwithstanding this great apparent contrast and the wide difference in the estimation which mankind form of the conduct of the actor in these different scenes still we can see that it is after all the impulse of the same lofty and indomitable spirit which acted in both the soul itself of the queen was not altered nor even the character of her action the change was in the object and aim in the one case she was contending against the authority of a husband to gain petty and useless victories in domestic strife in the other the same spirit and energy were expended in encountering the storms and tempests of outward adversity to sustain her husband and protect her children thus the change was a change of circumstances rather than of character  the change was however none the less important on that account in its influence on the king it restored to him the affection and sympathy of his wife and filled his heart with inward happiness it was a joyous change to him though it was produced by sufferings and sorrows for it was the very pressure of outward calamity that made his wife his friend again and restored his domestic peace in how many thousand instances is the same effect produced in a still more striking manner though on a less conspicuous stage than in the case of this royal pair and how many thousands of outwardly prosperous families there are from which domestic peace and happiness are gone and nothing but the pressure from without of affliction or calamity can ever restore them  in consequence in a great measure of henriettas efficient help the kings affairs greatly improved and for a time it seemed as if he would gain an ultimate and final victory over his enemies and recover his lost dominion he advanced to oxford and made his head quarters there and commenced the preparations for once more getting possession of the palaces and fortresses of london he called together a parliament at oxford some members came and were regularly organized in the two houses of lords and commons while the rest remained at london and continued their sittings there thus there were two governments two parliaments and two capitals in england and the whole realm was rent and distracted by the respective claims of these contending powers over the allegiance of the subjects and the government of the realm     chapter iii  queen henriettas flight    the brightening of the prospects in king charless affairs which was produced for a time by the queens vigorous and energetic action proved to be only a temporary gleam after all the clouds and darkness soon returned again and brooded over his horizon more gloomily than ever the parliament raised and organized new and more powerful armies the great republican general oliver cromwell who afterward became so celebrated as the protector in the time of the commonwealth came into the field and was very successful in all his military plans other republican generals appeared in all parts of the kingdom and fought with great determination and great success driving the armies of the king before them wherever they moved and reducing town after town and castle after castle until it began to appear evident that the whole kingdom would soon fall into their hands  in the mean time the family of the queen were very much separated from each other the children having been left in various places exposed each to different privations and dangers two or three of them were in london in the hands of their fathers enemies mary the young bride of the prince of orange was in holland prince charles the oldest son who was now about fourteen years of age was at the head of one of his fathers armies in the west of england of course such a boy could not be expected to accomplish any thing as a general or even to exercise any real military command he however had his place at the head of a considerable force and though there were generals with him to conduct all the operations and to direct the soldiery they were nominally the lieutenants of the prince and acted in all cases in their young commanders name their great duty was however after all to take care of their charge and the army which accompanied charles was thus rather an escort and a guard to secure his safety than a force from which any aid was to be expected in the recovery of the kingdom  the queen did every thing in her power to sustain the sinking fortunes of her husband but in vain at length in june 1644 she found herself unable to continue any longer such warlike and masculine exposures and toils it became necessary for her to seek some place of retreat where she could enjoy for a time at least the quiet and repose now essential to the preservation of her life oxford was no longer a place of safety the parliament had ordered her impeachment on account of her having brought in arms and munitions of war from foreign lands to disturb as they said the peace of the kingdom the parliamentary armies were advancing toward oxford and she was threatened with being shut up and besieged there she accordingly left oxford and went down to the sea coast to exeter a strongly fortified place on a hill surrounded in part by other hills and very near the sea there was a palace within the walls where the queen thought she could enjoy for a time at least the needed seclusion and repose the king accompanied her for a few miles on her journey to a place called abingdon which is in the neighborhood of oxford and there the unhappy pair bade each other farewell with much grief and many tears they never met again  henrietta continued her sorrowful journey alone she reached the sea coast in the southwestern part of england where exeter is situated and shut herself up in the place of her retreat she was in a state of great destitution for charless circumstances were now so reduced that he could afford her very little aid she sent across the channel to her friends in france asking them to help her they sent immediately the supplies that she neededarticles of clothing a considerable sum of money and a nurse she retained the clothing and the nurse and a little of the money the rest she sent to charles she was however now herself tolerably provided for in her new home and here a few weeks afterward her sixth child was born it was a daughter  the queens long continued exertions and exposures had seriously impaired her health and she lay feeble and low in her sick chamber for about ten days when she learned to her dismay that one of the parliamentary generals was advancing at the head of his army to attack the town which she had made her refuge this generals name was essex the queen sent a messenger out to meet essex asking him to allow her to withdraw from the town before he should invest it with his armies she said that she was very weak and feeble and unable to endure the privations and alarms which the inhabitants of a besieged town have necessarily to bear and she asked his permission therefore to retire to bristol till her health should be restored essex replied that he could not give her permission to retire from exeter that in fact the object of his coming there was to escort her to london to bring her before parliament to answer to the charge of treason  the queen perceived immediately that nothing but the most prompt and resolute action could enable her to escape the impending danger she had but little bodily strength remaining but that little was stimulated and renewed by the mental resolution and energy which as is usual in temperaments like hers burned all the brighter in proportion to the urgency of the danger which called it into action she rose from her sick bed and began to concert measures for making her escape she confided her plan to three trusty friends one gentleman one lady and her confessor who as her spiritual teacher and guide was her constant companion she disguised herself and these her attendants and succeeded in getting through the gates of exeter without attracting any observation this was before essex arrived she found however before she went far that the van of the army was approaching and she had to seek refuge in a hut till her enemies had passed she concealed herself among some straw her attendants seeking such other hiding places as were at hand it was two days before the bodies of soldiery had all passed so as to make it safe for the queen to come out of her retreat the hut would seem to have been uninhabited as the accounts state that she remained all this time without food though this seems to be an almost incredible degree of privation and exposure for an english queen at any rate she remained during all this time in a state of great mental anxiety and alarm for there were parties of soldiery constantly going by with a tumult and noise which kept her in continual terror their harsh and dissonant voices heard sometimes in angry quarrels and sometimes in mirth were always frightful in fact for a helpless woman in a situation like that of the queen the mood of reckless and brutal mirth in such savages was perhaps more to be dreaded than that of their anger  at one time the queen overheard a party of these soldiers talking about her they knew that to get possession of the papist queen was the object of their expedition they spoke of getting her head and carrying it to london saying that parliament had offered a reward of fifty thousand crowns for it and expressed the savage pleasure which it would give them to secure this prize by imprecations and oaths  they did not however discover their intended victim after the whole army passed the queen ventured cautiously forth from her retreat the little party got together again and still retaining their disguises moved on over the road by which the soldiers had come and which was in the shocking condition that a road and a country always exhibit where an army has been marching faint and exhausted with sickness abstinence and the effects of long continued anxiety and fear the queen had scarcely strength to go on she persevered however and at length found a second refuge in a cabin in a wood she was going to plymouth which is forty or fifty miles from exeter to the southwest and is the great port and naval station of the english in that quarter of the island  she stopped at this cabin for a little time to rest and to wait for some other friends and members of her household from the palace in exeter to join her those friends were to wait until they found that the queen succeeded in making her escape and then they were to follow each in a different way and all assuming such disguises as would most effectually help to conceal them there was one of the party whom it must have been somewhat difficult to disguise it was a dwarf named geoffrey hudson who had been a long time in the service of henrietta as a personal attendant and messenger it was the fancy of queens and princesses in those days to have such personages in their train the oddity of the idea pleased them and the smaller the dimensions of such a servitor the greater was his value in modern times all this is changed tall footmen now in the families of the great receive salaries in proportion to the number of inches in their stature and the dwarfs go to the museums to be exhibited for a price to the common wonder of mankind  the manner in which sir geoffrey hudson was introduced into the service of the queen was as odd as his figure it was just after she was married and when she was about eighteen years old she had two dwarfs then already a gentleman and a lady or as they termed it then a cavalier and a dame and to carry out the whimsical idea she had arranged a match between these two and had them married now there was in her court at that time a wild and thoughtless nobleman a great friend and constant companion of her husband charles the first named buckingham an account of his various exploits is given in our history of charles the first buckingham happened to hear of this geoffrey hudson who was then a boy of seven or eight years of age living with his parents somewhere in the interior of england he sent for him and had him brought secretly to his house and made an arrangement to have him enter the service of the queen without however saying any thing of his design to her he then invited the queen and her husband to visit him at his palace and when the time for luncheon arrived one day he conducted the party into the dining saloon to partake of some refreshment there was upon the table among other viands what appeared to be a large venison pie the company gathered around the table and a servant proceeded to cut the pie and on his breaking and raising a piece of the crust out stepped the young dwarf upon the table splendidly dressed and armed and advancing toward the queen he kneeled before her and begged to be received into her train her majesty was very much pleased with the addition itself thus made to her household as well as diverted by the odd manner in which her new attendant was introduced into her service  the youthful dwarf was then only eighteen inches high and he continued so until he was thirty years of age when to every bodys surprise he began to grow he grew quite rapidly and for a time there was a prospect that he would be entirely spoiled as his whole value had consisted thus far in his littleness he attained the height of three feet and a half and there the mysterious principle of organic expansion the most mysterious and inexplicable perhaps that is exhibited in all the phenomena of life seemed to be finally exhausted and though he lived to be nearly seventy years of age he grew no more  notwithstanding the bodily infirmity whatever it may have been which prevented his growth the dwarf possessed a considerable degree of mental capacity and courage he did not bear however very good naturedly the jests and gibes of which he was the continual object from the unfeeling courtiers who often took pleasure in teasing him and in getting him into all sorts of absurd and ridiculous situations at last his patience was entirely exhausted and he challenged one of his tormentors whose name was crofts to a duel crofts accepted the challenge and being determined to persevere in his fun to the end appeared on the battle ground armed only with a squirt this raised a laugh of course but it did not tend much to cool the injured lilliputians anger he sternly insisted on another meeting and with real weapons crofts had expected to have turned off the whole affair in a joke but he found this could not be done and public opinion among the courtiers around him compelled him finally to accept the challenge in earnest the parties met on horseback to put them more nearly on an equality they fought with pistols crofts was killed upon the spot  after this hudson was treated with more respect he was entrusted by the queen with many commissions and sometimes business was committed to him which required no little capacity judgment and courage he was now at the time of the queens escape from exeter of his full stature but as this was only three and a half feet he encountered great danger in attempting to find his way out of the city and through the advancing columns of the army to rejoin the queen he persevered however and reached her safely at last in the cabin in the wood the babe not yet two weeks old was necessarily left behind she was left in charge of lady morton whom the queen appointed her governess lady morton was young and beautiful she was possessed of great strength and energy of character and she devoted herself with her whole soul to preserving the life and securing the safety of her little charge  the queen and her party had to traverse a wild and desolate forest many miles in extent on the way to plymouth the name of it was dartmoor forest lonely as it was however the party was safer in it than in the open and inhabited country which was all disturbed and in commotion as every country necessarily is in time of civil war as the queen drew near to plymouth she found that for some reason it would not be safe to enter that town and so the whole party went on continuing their journey farther to the westward still  now there is one important seaport to the westward of plymouth which is called falmouth and near it on a high promontory jutting into the sea is a large and strong castle called pendennis castle this castle was at the time of the queens escape in the hands of the kings friends and she determined accordingly to seek refuge there the whole party arrived here safely on the 29th of june they were all completely worn out and exhausted by the fatigues privations and exposures of their terrible journey  the queen had determined to make her escape as soon as possible to france she could no longer be of any service to the king in england her resources were exhausted and her personal health was so feeble that she must have been a burden to his cause and not a help if she had remained there was a ship from holland in the harbor the prince of orange it will be recollected who had married the queens oldest daughter was a prince of holland and this vessel was under his direction some writers say it was sent to falmouth by him to be ready for his motherinlaw in case she should wish to make her escape from england others speak of it as being there accidentally at this time however this may be it was immediately placed at queen henriettas disposal and she determined to embark in it on the following morning she knew very well that as soon as essex should have heard of her escape parties would be scouring the country in all directions in pursuit of her and that although the castle where she had found a temporary refuge was strong it was not best to incur the risk of being shut up and besieged in it  she accordingly embarked with all her company on board the dutch ship on the very morning after her arrival and immediately put to sea they made all sail for the coast of france intending to land at dieppe dieppe is almost precisely east of falmouth two or three hundred miles from it up the english channel as it is on the other side of the channel it would lie to the south of falmouth were it not that both the french and english coasts trend here to the northward  some time before they arrived at their port they perceived some ships in the offing that seemed to be pursuing them they endeavored to escape but their pursuers gained rapidly upon them and at length fired a gun as a signal for the queens vessel to stop the ball came bounding over the water toward them but did no harm of course there was a scene of universal commotion and panic on board the queens ship some wanted to fire back upon the pursuers some wished to stop and surrender and others shrieked and cried and were overwhelmed with uncontrollable emotions of terror  in the midst of this dreadful scene of confusion the queen as was usual with her in such emergencies retained all her selfpossession and though weak and helpless before felt a fresh strength and energy now which the imminence itself of the danger seemed to inspire she was excited it is true as well as the rest but it was in her case the excitement of courage and resolution and not of senseless terror and despair she ascended to the deck she took the direct command of the ship she gave instructions to the pilot how to steer and though there was a storm coming on she ordered every sail to be set that the ship might be driven as rapidly as possible through the water she forbade the captain to fire back upon their pursuers fearing that such firing would occasion delay and she gave distinct and positive orders to the captain that so soon as it should appear that all hope of escape was gone and that they must inevitably fall into the hands of their enemies he was to set fire to the magazine of gunpowder in order that they might all be destroyed by the explosion  in the mean time all the ships pursuers and pursued were rapidly nearing the french coast the fugitives were hoping to reach their port they were also hoping every moment to see some friendly french ships appear in sight to rescue them to balance this double hope there was a double fear there were their pursuers behind them whose shots were continually booming over the water threatening them with destruction and there was a storm arising which with the great press of sail that they were carrying brought with it a danger perhaps more imminent still  it happened that these hopes and fears were all realized and nearly at the same time a shot struck the ship producing a great shock and throwing all on board into terrible consternation it damaged the rigging bringing down the rent sails and broken cordage to the deck and thus stopped the vessels way at the same moment some french vessels came in sight and as soon as they understood the case bore down full sail to rescue the disabled vessel the pursuers changing suddenly their pursuit to flight altered their course and moved slowly away the storm however increased and preventing them from making the harbor of dieppe drove them along the shore threatening every moment to dash them upon the rocks and breakers at length the queens vessel succeeded in getting into a rocky cove where they were sheltered from the winds and waves and found a chance to land the queen ordered out the boat and was set ashore with her attendants on the rocks she climbed over them wet as they were with the dashing spray and slippery with sea weed the little party drenched with the rain and exhausted and forlorn wandered along the shore till they came to a little village of fishermens huts the queen went into the first wretched cabin which offered itself and lay down upon the straw in the corner for rest and sleep  the tidings immediately spread all over the region that the queen of england had landed on the coast and produced of course universal excitement the gentry in the neighborhood flocked down the next morning in their carriages to offer henrietta their aid they supplied her wants invited her to their houses and offered her their equipages to take her wherever she should decide to go what she wanted was seclusion and rest they accordingly conveyed her at her request to the baths of bourbon where she remained some time until in fact her health and strength were in some measure restored great personages of state were sent to her here from paris with money and all other necessary supplies and in due time she was escorted in state to the city and established in great magnificence and splendor in the louvre which was then one of the principal palaces of the capital  notwithstanding the outward change which was thus made in the circumstances of the exiled queen she was very unhappy as the excitement of her danger and her efforts to escape it passed away her spirits sunk her beauty faded and her countenance assumed the wan and haggard expression of despair she mourned over the ruin of her husbands hopes and her separation from him and from her children with perpetual tears she called to mind continually the image of the little babe not yet three weeks old whom she had left so defenseless in the very midst of her enemies she longed to get some tidings of the child and reproached herself sometimes for having thus as it were abandoned her  the localities which were the scenes of these events have been made very famous by them and traditional tales of queen henriettas residence in exeter and of her romantic escape from it have been handed down there from generation to generation to the present day they caused her portrait to be painted too and hung it up in the city hall of exeter as a memorial of their royal visitor the palace where the little infant was born has long since passed away but the portrait hangs in the guildhall still     chapter iv  escape of the children    we left the mother of prince charles at the close of the last chapter in the palace of the louvre in paris though all her wants were now supplied and though she lived in royal state in a magnificent palace on the banks of the seine still she was disconsolate and unhappy she had indeed succeeded in effecting her own escape from the terrible dangers which had threatened her family in england but she had left her husband and children behind and she could not really enjoy herself the shelter which she had found from the storm as long as those whom she so ardently loved were still out exposed to all its fury she had six children prince charles the oldest was in the western part of england in camp acting nominally as the commander of an army and fighting for his fathers throne he was now fourteen years of age next to him was mary the wife of the prince of orange who was safe in holland she was one year younger than charles james the third child whose title was now duke of york was about ten he had been left in oxford when that city was surrendered and had been taken captive there by the republican army the general in command sent him to london a prisoner it was hard for such a child to be a captive but then there was one solace in his lot by being sent to london he rejoined his little sister elizabeth and his brother henry who had remained there all the time henry was three years old and elizabeth was six these children being too young as was supposed to attempt an escape were not very closely confined they were entrusted to the charge of some of the nobility and lived in one of the london palaces james was a very thoughtful and considerate boy and had been enough with his father in his campaigns to understand something of the terrible dangers with which the family were surrounded the other children were too young to know or care about them and played blindmans buff and hide and go seek in the great saloons of the palace with as much infantile glee as if their father and mother were as safe and happy as ever  though they felt thus no uneasiness and anxiety for themselves their exiled mother mourned for them and was oppressed by the most foreboding fears for their personal safety she thought however still more frequently of the babe and felt a still greater solicitude for her left as she had been at so exceedingly tender an age in a situation of the most extreme and imminent danger she felt somewhat guilty in having yielded her reluctant consent for political reasons to have her other children educated in what she believed a false system of religious faith and she now prayed earnestly to god to spare the life of this her last and dearest child and vowed in her anguish that if the babe were ever restored to her she would break through all restrictions and bring her up a true believer this vow she afterward earnestly fulfilled  the child it will be recollected was left when henrietta escaped from exeter in the care of the countess of morton a young and beautiful and also a very intelligent and energetic lady the child had a visit from its father soon after its mother left it king charles as soon as he heard that essex was advancing to besiege exeter where he knew that the queen had sought refuge and was of course exposed to fall into his power hastened with an army to her rescue he arrived in time to prevent essex from getting possession of the place he in fact drove the besieger away from the town and entered it himself in triumph the queen was gone but he found the child  the king gazed upon the little stranger with a mixture of joy and sorrow he caused it to be baptized and named it henrietta anne the name henrietta was from the mother anne was the name of henriettas sisterinlaw in paris who had been very kind to her in all her troubles the king made ample arrangements for supplying lady morton with money out of the revenues of the town of exeter and thinking that the child would be as safe in exeter as any where left her there and went away to resume again his desperate conflicts with his political foes  lady morton remained for some time at exeter but the kings cause every where declined his armies were conquered his towns were taken and he was compelled at last to give himself up a prisoner exeter as well as all the other strongholds in the kingdom fell into the hands of the parliamentary armies they sent lady morton and the little henrietta to london and soon afterward provided them with a home in the mansion at oatlands where the queen herself and her other children had lived before it was a quiet and safe retreat but lady morton was very little satisfied with the plan of remaining there she wished very much to get the babe back to its mother again in paris she heard at length of rumors that a plan was forming by the parliament to take the child out of her charge and she then resolved to attempt an escape at all hazards  henrietta anne was now two years old and was beginning to talk a little when asked what was her name they had taught her to attempt to reply princess though she did not succeed in uttering more than the first letters of the word her answer being in fact prah lady morton conceived the idea of making her escape across the country in the disguise of a beggar woman changing at the same time the princess into a boy she was herself very tall and graceful and beautiful and it was hard for her to make herself look old and ugly she however made a hump for her back out of a bundle of linen and stooped in her gait to counterfeit age she dressed herself in soiled and ragged clothes disfigured her face by reversing the contrivances with which ladies in very fashionable life are said sometimes to produce artificial youth and beauty and with the child in a bundle on her back and a staff in her hand she watched for a favorable opportunity to escape stealthily from the palace in the forlorn hope of walking in that way undetected to dover a march of fifty miles through a country filled with enemies  little henrietta was to be a boy and as people on the way might ask the child its name lady morton was obliged to select one for her which would fit in some degree her usual reply to such a question she chose the name pierre which sounds at least as much like prah as princess does the poor child though not old enough to speak distinctly was still old enough to talk a great deal she was very indignant at the vile dress which she was compelled to wear and at being called a beggar boy she persisted in telling every body whom she met that she was not a boy nor a beggar nor pierre but the princess saying it all however very fortunately in such an unintelligible way that it only alarmed lady morton without however attracting the attention of those who heard it or giving them any information  contrary to every reasonable expectation lady morton succeeded in her wild and romantic attempt she reached dover in safety she made arrangements for crossing in the packet boat which then as now plied from dover to calais she landed at length safely on the french coast where she threw off her disguise resumed her natural grace and beauty made known her true name and character and traveled in ease and safety to paris the excitement and the intoxicating joy which henrietta experienced when she got her darling child once more in her arms can be imagined perhaps even by the most sedate american mother but the wild and frantic violence of her expressions of it none but those who are conversant with the french character and french manners can know  it was not very far from the time of little henriettas escape from her fathers enemies in london though in fact before it that prince charles made his escape from the island too his father finding that his cause was becoming desperate gave orders to those who had charge of his son to retreat to the southwestern coast of the island and if the republican armies should press hard upon him there he was to make his escape if necessary by sea  the southwestern part of england is a long mountainous promontory constituting the county of cornwall it is a wild and secluded region and the range which forms it seems to extend for twenty or thirty miles under the sea where it rises again to the surface forming a little group of islands more wild and rugged even than the land these are the scilly isles they lie secluded and solitary and are known chiefly to mankind through the ships that seek shelter among them in storms prince charles retreated from post to post through cornwall the danger becoming more and more imminent every day till at last it became necessary to fly from the country altogether he embarked on board a vessel and went first to the scilly isles  from scilly he sailed eastward toward the coast of france he landed first at the island of jersey which though it is very near the french coast and is inhabited by a french population is under the english government here the prince met with a very cordial reception as the authorities were strongly attached to his fathers cause jersey is a beautiful isle and far enough south to enjoy a genial climate where flowers bloom and fruits ripen in the warm sunbeams which are here no longer intercepted by the driving mists and rains which sweep almost perceptibly along the hill sides and fields of england  prince charles did not however remain long in jersey his destination was paris he passed therefore across to the main land and traveled to the capital he was received with great honors at his mothers new home in the palace of the louvre as a royal prince and heir apparent to the british crown he was now sixteen the adventures which he met with on his arrival will be the subject of the next chapter  james the duke of york remained still in london he continued there for two years during which time his fathers affairs went totally to ruin the unfortunate king after his armies were all defeated and his cause was finally given up by his friends and he had surrendered himself a prisoner to his enemies was taken from castle to castle every where strongly guarded and very closely confined at length worn down with privations and sufferings and despairing of all hope of relief he was taken to london to be tried for his life james in the mean time with his brother the little duke of gloucester and his sister elizabeth were kept in st jamess palace as has already been stated under the care of an officer to whom they had been given in charge  the queen was particularly anxious to have james make his escape he was older than the others and in case of the death of charles would be of course the next heir to the crown he did in fact live till after the close of his brothers reign and succeeded him under the title of james the second his being thus in the direct line of succession made his father and mother very desirous of effecting his rescue while the parliament were strongly desirous for the same reason of keeping him safely his governor received therefore a special charge to take the most effectual precautions to prevent his escape and for this purpose not to allow of his having any communication whatever with his parents or his absent friends the governor took all necessary measures to prevent such intercourse and as an additional precaution made james promise that he would not receive any letter from any person unless it came through him  jamess mother however not knowing these circumstances wrote a letter to him and sent it by a trusty messenger directing him to watch for some opportunity to deliver it unobserved now there is a certain game of ball called tennis which was formerly a favorite amusement in england and on the continent of europe and which in fact continues to be played there still it requires an oblong enclosure surrounded by high walls against which the balls rebound such an enclosure is called a tennis court it was customary to build such tennis courts in most of the royal palaces there was one at st jamess palace where the young james it seems used sometimes to play footnote it was to such a tennis court at versailles that the great national assembly of france adjourned when the king excluded them from their hall at the commencement of the great revolution and where they took the famous oath not to separate till they had established a constitution which has been so celebrated in history as the oath of the tennis court strangers had the opportunity of seeing the young prince in his coming and going to and from this place of amusement and the queens messenger determined to offer him the letter there he accordingly tendered it to him stealthily as he was passing saying take this it is from your mother  james drew back replying i can not take it i have promised that i will not  the messenger reported to the queen that he offered the letter to james and that he refused to receive it his mother was very much displeased and wondered what such a strange refusal could mean  although james thus failed to receive his communication he was allowed at length once or twice to have an interview with his father and in these interviews the king recommended to him to make his escape if he could and to join his mother in france james determined to obey this injunction and immediately set to work to plan his escape he was fifteen years of age and of course old enough to exercise some little invention  he was accustomed as we have already stated to join the younger children in games of hide and go seek he began now to search for the most recondite hiding places where he could not be found and when he had concealed himself in such a place he would remain there for a very long time until his playmates had given up the search in despair then at length after having been missing for half an hour he would reappear of his own accord he thought that by this plan he should get the children and the attendants accustomed to his being for a long time out of sight so that when at length he should finally disappear their attention would not be seriously attracted to the circumstance until he should have had time to get well set out upon his journey  he had like his mother a little dog but unlike her he was not so strongly attached to it as to be willing to endanger his life to avoid a separation when the time arrived therefore to set out on his secret journey he locked the dog up in his room to prevent its following him and thus increasing the probability of his being recognized and brought back he then engaged his brother and sister and his other playmates in the palace in a game of hide and go seek he went off ostensibly to hide but instead of doing so he stole out of the palace gates in company with a friend named banfield and a footman it was in the rear of the palace that he made his exit at a sort of postern gate which opened upon an extensive park after crossing the park the party hurried on through london and then directed their course down the river thames toward gravesend a port near the mouth of the river where they intended to embark for holland they had taken the precaution to disguise themselves james wore a wig which changing the color and appearance of his hair seemed to give a totally new expression to his face he substituted other clothes too for those which he was usually accustomed to wear the whole party succeeded thus in traversing the country without detection they reached gravesend embarked on board a vessel there and sailed to holland where james joined the prince of orange and his sister and sent word to his mother that he had arrived there in safety  his little brother and sister were left behind they were too young to fly themselves and too old to be conveyed away as little henrietta had been in the arms of another they had however the mournful satisfaction of seeing their father just before his execution and of bidding him a last farewell the king when he was condemned to die begged to be allowed to see these children they were brought to visit him in the chamber where he was confined his parting interview with them and the messages of affection and farewell which he sent to their brothers and sisters and to their mother constitute one of the most affecting scenes which the telescope of history brings to our view in that long and distant vista of the past which it enables us so fully to explore the little gloucester was too young to understand the sorrows of the hour but elizabeth felt them in all their intensity she was twelve years old when brought to her father she burst into tears and wept long and bitterly her little brother sympathizing in his sisters sorrow though not comprehending its cause wept bitterly too elizabeth was thoughtful enough to write an account of what took place at this most solemn farewell as soon as it was over her account is as follows  what the king said to me on the 29th of january 1648 the last time i had the happiness to see him  he told me that he was glad i was come for though he had not time to say much yet somewhat he wished to say to me which he could not to another and he had feared the cruelty was too great to permit his writing but darling he added thou wilt forget what i tell thee then shedding an abundance of tears i told him that i would write down all he said to me he wished me he said not to grieve and torment myself for him for it was a glorious death he should die it being for the laws and religion of the land he told me what books to read against popery he said that he had forgiven all his enemies and he hoped god would forgive them also and he commanded us and all the rest of my brothers and sisters to forgive them too above all he bade me tell my mother that his thoughts had never strayed from her and that his love for her would be the same to the last withal he commanded me and my brother to love her and be obedient to her he desired me not to grieve for him for he should die a martyr and that he doubted not but god would restore the throne to his son and that then we should be all happier than we could possibly have been if he had lived  then taking my brother gloucester on his knee he said dear boy now will they cut off thy fathers head upon which the child looked very steadfastly upon him heed my child what i say they will cut off my head and perhaps make thee a king but mark what i say you must not be a king as long as your brothers charles and james live therefore i charge you do not be made a king by them at which the child sighing deeply replied i will be torn in pieces first and these words coining so unexpectedly from so young a child rejoiced my father exceedingly and his majesty spoke to him of the welfare of his soul and to keep his religion commanding him to fear god and he would provide for him all which the young child earnestly promised to do  after the kings death the parliament kept these children in custody for some time and at last they became somewhat perplexed to know what to do with them it was even proposed when cromwells republican government had become fully established to bind them out apprentices to learn some useful trade this plan was however not carried into effect they were held as prisoners and sent at last to carisbrooke castle where their father had been confined little henry too young to understand his sorrows grew in strength and stature like any other boy but elizabeth pined and sunk under the burden of her woes she mourned incessantly her fathers cruel death her mothers and her brothers exile and her own wearisome and hopeless captivity little harry as she called him and a bible which her father gave her in his last interview with her were her only companions she lingered along for two years after her fathers death until at length the hectic flush the signal of approaching dissolution appeared upon her cheek and an unnatural brilliancy brightened in her eyes they sent her fathers physician to see if he could save her his prescriptions did no good one day the attendants came into her apartment and found her sitting in her chair with her cheek resting upon the bible which she had been reading and which she had placed for a sort of pillow on the table to rest her weary head upon when her reading was done she was motionless they would have thought her asleep but her eyes were not closed she was dead the poor childs sorrows and sufferings were ended forever  the stern republicans who now held dominion over england men of iron as they were could not but be touched with the unhappy fate of this their beautiful and innocent victim and they so far relented from the severity of the policy which they had pursued toward the illfated family as to send the little gloucester after his sisters death home to his mother     chapter v  the princes reception at paris    so complicated a story as that of the family of charles can not be related in all its parts in the exact order of time and having now shown under what circumstances the various members of the family made their escape from the dangers which threatened them in england we return to follow the adventures of prince charles during his residence on the continent and more particularly in this chapter to describe his reception by the royal family of france he was one of the first of the children that escaped having arrived in france in 1646 his father was not beheaded until two years afterward  in order that the reader may understand distinctly the situation in which charles found himself on his arrival at paris we must first describe the condition of the royal family of france at this time they resided sometimes at fontainebleau a splendid palace in the midst of a magnificent park about forty miles from the city henrietta it will be recollected was the sister of a king of france this king was louis xiii he died however not far from the time of queen henriettas arrival in the country leaving his little son louis then five years old heir to the crown the little louis of course became king immediately in name as louis xiv and in the later periods of his life he attained to so high a degree of prosperity and power that he has been ever since his day considered one of the most renowned of all the french kings he was of course prince charless cousin at the period of prince charless arrival however he was a mere child being then about eight years old of course he was too young really to exercise any of the powers of the government his mother anne of austria was made regent and authorized to govern the country until the young king should arrive at a suitable age to exercise his hereditary powers in his own name anne of austria had been always very kind to henrietta and had always rendered her assistance whenever she had been reduced to any special extremity of distress it was she who had sent the supplies of money and clothing to henrietta when she fled sick and destitute to exeter vainly hoping to find repose and the means of restoration there  besides king louis xiii who had died henrietta had another brother whose name was gaston duke of orleans the duke of orleans had a daughter who was styled the duchess of montpensier deriving the title from her mother she was of course also a cousin of prince charles her father being brother of the late king and uncle of the present one was made lieutenant general of the kingdom having thus the second place that is the place next to the queen in the management of the affairs of the realm thus the little king commenced his reign by having in his court his mother as queen regent his uncle lieutenant general and his aunt an exiled queen from a sister realm his guest he had also in his household his brother philip younger than himself his cousin the young duchess of montpensier and his cousin the prince charles the family relationship of all these individuals will be made more clear by being presented in a tabular form as follows   royal family of france in the time of louis xiv            louis xiii                   louis xiv           anne of austria              philip 8 years old  henry iv  gaston duke of orleans      duchess of montpensier duchess of montpensier            henrietta maria              prince charles 16           king charles i   in the above table the first column contains the name of henry iv the second those of three of his children with the persons whom they respectively married and the third the four grandchildren who as cousins now found themselves domesticated together in the royal palaces of france  the young king was as has already been said about eight years old at the time of prince charless arrival the palace in which he resided when in the city was the palace royal which was then and has been ever since one of the most celebrated buildings in the world it was built at an enormous expense during a previous reign by a powerful minister of state who was in ecclesiastical rank a cardinal and his mansion was named accordingly the palace cardinal it had however been recently taken as a royal residence and its name changed to palace royal here the queen regent had her grand apartments of state every thing being as rich as the most lavish expenditure could make it she had one apartment called an oratory a sort of closet for prayer which was lighted by a large window the sash of which was made of silver the interior of the room was ornamented with the most costly paintings and furniture and was enriched with a profusion of silver and gold the little king had his range of apartments too with a whole household of officers and attendants as little as himself these children were occupied continually with ceremonies and pageants and mock military parades in which they figured in miniature arms and badges of authority and with dresses made to imitate those of real monarchs and ministers of state every thing was regulated with the utmost regard to etiquette and punctilio and without any limits or bounds to the expense thus though the youthful officers of the little monarchs household exercised no real power they displayed all the forms and appearances of royalty with more than usual pomp and splendor it was a species of childs play it is true but it was probably the most grand and magnificent childs play that the world has ever witnessed it was into this extraordinary scene that prince charles found himself ushered on his arrival in france  at the time of the princes arrival the court happened to be residing not at paris but at fontainebleau fontainebleau as has already been stated is about forty miles from paris to the southward there is a very splendid palace and castle there built originally in very ancient times there is a town near both the castle and the town being in the midst of a vast park and forest one of the most extended and magnificent royal domains in europe this forest has been reserved as a hunting ground for the french kings from a very early age it covers an area of forty thousand acres being thus many miles in extent the royal family were at this palace at the time of prince charless arrival celebrating the festivities of a marriage the prince accordingly as we shall presently see went there to join them  there were two persons who were anticipating the princes arrival in france with special interest his mother and his young cousin the duchess of montpensier her christian name was anne marie louisa footnote she is commonly called in the annals of the day in which she lived mademoiselle as she was par eminence the young lady of the court in history she is commonly called mademoiselle de montpensier we shall call her in this narrative simply anne maria as that is for our purpose the most convenient designation she was a gay frivolous and coquettish girl of about nineteen immensely rich being the heiress of the vast estates of her mother who was not living her father though he was the lieutenant general of the realm and the former kings brother was not rich his wife when she died had bequeathed all her vast estates to her daughter anne maria was naturally haughty and vain and as her father was accustomed to come occasionally to her to get supplies of money she was made vainer and more selfconceited still by his dependence upon her several matches had been proposed to her and among them the emperor of germany had been named he was a widower his first wife who had been anne marias aunt had just died as the emperor was a potentate of great importance the young belle thought she should prefer him to any of the others who had been proposed and she made no secret of this her choice it is true that he had made no proposal to her but she presumed that he would do so after a suitable time had elapsed from the death of his first wife and anne maria was contented to wait considering the lofty elevation to which she would attain on becoming his bride  but queen henrietta maria had another plan she was very desirous to obtain anne maria for the wife of her son charles there were many reasons for this the young lady was a princess of the royal family of france she possessed too an immense fortune and was young and beautiful withal though not quite so young as charles himself he was sixteen and she was about nineteen it is true that charles was now in some sense a fugitive and an exile destitute of property and without a home still he was a prince he was the heir apparent of the kingdoms of england and scotland he was young and accomplished these high qualifications somewhat exaggerated perhaps by maternal partiality seemed quite sufficient to henrietta to induce the proud duchess to become the princes bride  all this it must be remembered took place before the execution of king charles the first and when of course the fortunes of the family were not so desperate as they afterward became queen henrietta had a great many conversations with anne maria before the prince arrived in which she praised very highly his person and his accomplishments she narrated to the duchess the various extraordinary adventures and the narrow escapes which the prince had met with in the course of his wanderings in england she told her how dutiful and kind he had been to her as a son and how efficient and courageous in his fathers cause as a soldier she described his appearance and his manners and foretold how he would act what tastes and preferences he would form and how he would be regarded in the french court the young duchess listened to all this with an appearance of indifference and unconcern which was partly real and partly only assumed she could not help feeling some curiosity to see her cousin but her head was too full of the grander destination of being the wife of the emperor to think much of the pretensions of this wandering and homeless exile  prince charles on his arrival went first to paris where he found his mother there was an invitation for them here to proceed to fontainebleau where as has already been stated the young king and his court were now residing they went there accordingly and were received with every mark of attention and honor the queen regent took the young king into the carriage of state and rode some miles along the avenue through the forest to meet the prince and his mother when they were coming they were attended with the usual cortege of carriages and horsemen and they moved with all the etiquette and ceremony proper to be observed in the reception of royal visitors  when the carriages met in the forest they stopped and the distinguished personages contained in them alighted queen henrietta introduced her son to the queen regent and to louis the french king and also to other personages of distinction who were in their train among them was anne maria the queen regent took henrietta and the prince into the carriage with her and the young king and they proceeded thus together back to the palace prince charles was somewhat embarrassed in making all these new acquaintances in circumstances too of so much ceremony and parade and the more so as his knowledge of the french language was imperfect he could understand it when spoken but could not speak it well himself and he appeared accordingly somewhat awkward and confused he seemed particularly at a loss in his intercourse with anne maria she was a little older than himself and being perfectly at home both in the ceremonies of the occasion and in the language of the company she felt entirely at her ease herself and yet from her natural temperament and character she assumed such an air and bearing as would tend to prevent the prince from being so in a word it happened then as it has often happened since on similar occasions that the beau was afraid of the belle  the party returned to the palace on alighting the little king gave his hand to his aunt the queen of england while prince charles gave his to the queen regent and thus the two matrons were gallanted into the hall the prince had a seat assigned him on the following day in the queen regents drawing room and was thus regularly instated as an inmate of the royal household he remained here several days and at length the whole party returned to paris  anne maria in after years wrote reminiscences of her early life which were published after her death in this journal she gives an account of her introduction to the young prince and of her first acquaintance with him it is expressed as follows  he was only sixteen or seventeen years of age rather tall with a fine head black hair a dark complexion and a tolerably agreeable countenance but he neither spoke nor understood french which was very inconvenient nevertheless every thing was done to amuse him and during the three days that he remained at fontainebleau there were hunts and every other sport which could be commanded in that season he paid his respects to all the princesses and i discovered immediately that the queen of england wished to persuade me that he had fallen in love with me she told me that he talked of me incessantly that were she not to prevent it he would be in my apartment footnote this means at her residence the whole suite of rooms occupied by a family is called in france their apartment at all hours that he found me quite to his taste and that he was in despair on account of the death of the empress for he was afraid that they would seek to marry me to the emperor i listened to all she said as became me but it did not have as much effect upon me as probably she wished  after spending a few days at fontainebleau the whole party returned to paris and queen henrietta and the prince took up their abode again in the palace royal or as it is now more commonly called the palais royal charles was much impressed with the pomp and splendor of the french court so different from the rough mode of life to which he had been accustomed in his campaigns and wanderings in england the etiquette and formality however were extreme every thing even the minutest motions being regulated by nice rules which made social intercourse and enjoyment one perpetual ceremony but notwithstanding all this pomp and splendor and the multitude of officers and attendants who were constantly on service there seems to have been in the results obtained a strange mixture of grand parade with discomfort and disorder at one time at fontainebleau at a great entertainment where all the princes and potentates that had been drawn there by the wedding were assembled the cooks quarreled in the kitchen and one of the courses of the supper failed entirely in consequence of their dissensions and at another time as a large party of visitors were passing out through a suite of rooms in great state to descend a grand staircase where some illustrious foreigners who were present were to take their leave they found the apartments through which they were to pass all dark the servants had neglected or forgotten to light them  these and similar incidents show that there may be regal luxury and state without order or comfort as there may be regal wealth and power without any substantial happiness notwithstanding this however prince charles soon became strongly interested in the modes of life to which he was introduced at paris and at fontainebleau there were balls parties festivities and excursions of pleasure without number his interest in these all being heightened by the presence of anne maria whom he soon began to regard with a strong degree of that peculiar kind of interest which princesses and heiresses inspire in anne marias memoirs of her early life we have a vivid description of many of the scenes in which both she herself and charles were such prominent actors she wrote always with great freedom and in a very graphic manner so that the tale which she tells of this period of her life forms a very entertaining narrative  anne maria gives a very minute account of what took place between herself and charles on several occasions in the course of their acquaintance and describes particularly various balls and parties and excursions of pleasure on which she was attended by the young prince her vanity was obviously gratified by the interest which charles seemed to take in her but she was probably incapable of any feelings of deep and disinterested love and charles made no impression upon her heart she reserved herself for the emperor  for example they were all one night invited to a grand ball by the duchess de choisy this lady lived in a magnificent mansion called the hotel de choisy just before the time came for the party of visitors to go the queen of england came over with charles to the apartments of anne maria the queen came ostensibly to give the last touches to the adjustment of the young ladys dress and to the arrangement of her hair but really without doubt in pursuance of her policy of taking every occasion to bring the young people together  she came says anne maria in her narrative to dress me and arrange my hair herself she came for this purpose to my apartments and took the utmost pains to set me off to the best advantage and the prince of wales held the flambeau near me to light my toilet the whole time i wore black white and carnation and my jewelry was fastened by ribbons of the same colors i wore a plume of the same kind all these had been selected and ordered by my aunt henrietta the queen regent who knew that i was in my aunt henriettas hands sent for me to come and see her when i was all ready before going to the ball i accordingly went and this gave the prince an opportunity to go at once to the hotel de choisy and be ready there to receive me when i should arrive i found him there at the door ready to hand me from my coach i stopped in a chamber to readjust my hair and the prince of wales again held a flambeau for me this time too he brought his cousin prince rupert as an interpreter between us for believe it who will though he could understand every word i said to him he could not reply the least sentence to me in french when the ball was finished and we retired the prince followed me to the porters lodge of my hotel footnote in all the great houses in paris the principal buildings of the edifice stand back from the street surrounding a court yard which has sometimes shrubbery and flowers and a fountain in the center the entrance to this court yard is by a great gate and archway on the street with the apartments occupied by the porter that is the keeper of the gate on one side the entrance to the porters lodge is from under the archway and lingered till i entered and then went his way  there was another occasion on which his gallantry to me attracted a great deal of attention it was at a great fete celebrated at the palais royal there was a play acted with scenery and music and then a ball it took three whole days to arrange my ornaments for this night the queen of england would dress me on this occasion also with her own hands my robe was all figured with diamonds with carnation trimmings i wore the jewels of the crown of france and to add to them the queen of england lent me some fine ones of her own which she had not then sold the queen praised the fine turn of my shape my air the beauty of my complexion and the brightness of my light hair i had a conspicuous seat in the middle of the ballroom with the young king of france and the prince of wales at my feet i did not feel the least embarrassed for as i had an idea of marrying the emperor i regarded the prince of wales only as an object of pity  things went on in this way for a time until at last some political difficulties occurred at paris which broke in upon the ordinary routine of the royal family and drove them for a time out of the city before these troubles were over henrietta and her son were struck down as by a blow by the tidings which came upon them like a thunderbolt that their husband and father had been beheaded this dreadful event put a stop for a time to every thing like festive pleasures the queen left her children her palace and all the gay circle of her friends and retired to a convent to mourn in solitude and undisturbed her irreparable loss     chapter vi  negotiations with anne maria    our prince charles now becomes by the death of his father king charles the second both of england and of scotland that is he becomes so in theory according to the principles of the english constitution though in fact he is a fugitive and an exile still notwithstanding his exclusion however from the exercise of what he considered his right to reign he was acknowledged as king by all true royalists in england and by all the continental powers they would not aid him to recover his throne but in the courts and royal palaces which he visited he was regarded as a king and was treated in form at least with all the consideration and honor which belonged to royalty queen henrietta was overwhelmed with grief and despair when she learned the dreadful tidings of the execution of her husband at the time when these tidings came to her she was involved also in many other sufferings and trials as was intimated in the last chapter serious difficulties had occurred between the royal family of france and the government and people of the city of paris from which a sort of insurrection had resulted and the young king and his mother together with all the principal personages of the court had been compelled to fly from the city in the night to save their lives they went in a train of twenty or thirty carriages by torch light having kept their plan a profound secret until the moment of their departure the young king was asleep in his bed until the time arrived when they took him up and put him into the carriage anne maria whose rank and wealth gave her a great deal of influence and power took sides in some degree with the parisians in this contest so that her aunt the queen regent considered her as an enemy rather than a friend she however took her with them in their flight but anne maria being very much out of humor did all she could to tease and torment the party all the way when they awoke her and informed her of their proposed escape from paris she was as she says in her memoirs very much delighted for she knew that the movement was very unwise and would get her aunt the queen regent and all their friends into serious difficulties  she dressed herself as quick as she could came down stairs and proceeded to enter the queen regents coach saying that she wanted to have one or the other of certain seatsnaming the best placesas she had no idea she said of being exposed to cold or riding uncomfortably on such a night the queen told her that those seats were for herself and another lady of high rank who was with her to which anne maria replied oh very well i suppose young ladies ought to give up to old people  in the course of conversation as they were preparing to ride away the queen asked anne maria if she was not surprised at being called up to go on such an expedition oh no said she my father that is gaston the duke of orleans told me all about it beforehand this was not true as she says herself in her own account of these transactions she knew nothing about the plan until she was called from her bed she said this therefore only to tease her aunt by the false pretension that the secret had been confided to her her aunt however did not believe her and said then why did you go to bed if you knew what was going on oh replied anne maria i thought it would be a good plan to get some sleep as i did not know whether i should even have a bed to lie upon tomorrow night  the party of fugitives exhibited a scene of great terror and confusion as they were assembling and crowding into their carriages before they left the court of the palais royal it was past midnight in the month of january and there was no moon called up suddenly as they were from their beds and frightened with imaginary dangers they all pressed forward eager to go and so hurried was their departure that they took with them very scanty supplies even for their most ordinary wants at length they drove away they passed rapidly out of the city they proceeded to an ancient palace and castle called st germains about ten miles northeast of paris anne maria amused herself with the fears and difficulties and privations which the others suffered and she gives an account of the first night they spent in the place of their retreat which as it illustrates her temperament and character the reader will like perhaps to see  i slept in a very handsome room well painted well gilded and large with very little fire and no windows footnote that is with no glass to the windows which is not very agreeable in the month of january i slept on mattresses which were laid upon the floor and my sister who had no bed slept with me i was obliged to sing to get her to sleep and then her slumber did not last long so that she disturbed mine she tossed about felt me near her woke up and exclaimed that she saw the beast so i was obliged to sing again to put her to sleep and in that way i passed the night judge whether this was an agreeable situation for one who had had little or no sleep the night before and who had been ill all winter with colds however the fatigue and exposure of this expedition cured me  in a short time my father gave me his room but as nobody knew i was there i was awoke in the night by a noise i drew back my curtain and was astonished to find my chamber filled with men in large buff skin collars and who appeared surprised to see me and knew me as little as i did them i had no change of linen and when i wanted any thing washed it was done in the night while i was in bed i had no women to arrange my hair and dress me which is very inconvenient still i did not lose my gayety and they were in admiration at my making no complaint and it is true that i am a creature that can make the most of every thing and am greatly above trifles  to feel any commiseration for this young lady on account of the alarm which she may be supposed to have experienced at seeing all those strange men in her chamber would be sympathy thrown away for her nerves were not of a sensibility to be affected much by such a circumstance as that in fact as the difficulties between the young kings government and the parisians increased anne maria played quite the part of a heroine she went back and forth to paris in her carriage through the mob when nobody else dared to go she sometimes headed troops and escorted ladies and gentlemen when they were afraid to go alone once she relieved a town and once she took the command of the cannon of the bastille and issued her orders to fire with it upon the troops with a composure which would have done honor to any veteran officer of artillery we can not go into all these things here in detail as they would lead us too far away from the subject of this narrative we only allude to them to give our readers some distinct idea of the temperament and character of the rich and blooming beauty whom young king charles was wishing so ardently to make his bride  during the time that these difficulties continued in paris queen henriettas situation was extremely unhappy she was shut up in the palace of the louvre which became now her prison rather than her home she was separated from the royal family her son the king was generally absent in holland or in jersey and her palace was often surrounded by mobs whenever she ventured out in her carriage she was threatened with violence and outrage by the populace in such a manner as to make her retreat as soon as possible to the protection of the palace walls her pecuniary means too were exhausted she sold her jewels from time to time as long as they lasted and then contracted debts which her creditors were continually pressing her to pay her friends at st germains could not help her otherwise than by asking her to come to them this she at last concluded to do and she made her escape from paris under the escort of anne maria who came to the city for the purpose of conducting her and who succeeded though with infinite difficulty in securing a safe passage for henrietta through the crowds of creditors and political foes who threatened to prevent her journey these troubles were all however at last settled and in the autumn 1649 the whole party returned again to paris  in the mean time the young king charles was contriving schemes for getting possession of his realm it will be recollected that his sister mary who married the prince of orange was at this time residing at the hague a city in holland near the sea charles went often there it was a sort of rendezvous for those who had been obliged to leave england on account of their attachment to his fathers fortunes and who now that the father was dead transferred their loyalty to the son they felt a very strong desire that charless plans for getting possession of his kingdom should succeed and they were willing to do every thing in their power to promote his success it must not be supposed however that they were governed in this by a disinterested principle of fidelity to charles himself personally or to the justice of his cause their own reestablishment in wealth and power was at stake as well as his and they were ready to make common cause with him knowing that they could save themselves from ruin only by reinstating him  charles had his privy council and a sort of court at the hague and he arranged channels of communication centering there for collecting intelligence from england and scotland and through these he watched in every way for the opening of an opportunity to assert his rights to the british crown he went too to jersey where the authorities and the inhabitants were on his side and both there and at the hague he busied himself with plans for raising funds and levying troops and securing cooperation from those of the people of england who still remained loyal ireland was generally in his favor too and he seriously meditated an expedition there his mother was unwilling to have him engage in these schemes she was afraid he would sooner or later involve himself in dangers from which he could not extricate himself and that he would end by being plunged into the same pit of destruction that had engulfed his father  amid all these political schemes however charles did not forget anne maria he was sager to secure her for his bride for her fortune and the power and influence of her connections would aid him very much in recovering his throne her hope of marrying the emperor of germany too was gone for that potentate had chosen another wife charles therefore continued his attentions to the young lady she would not give him any distinct and decisive answer but kept the subject in a state of perpetual negotiation she was in fact growing more and more discontented and unhappy in disposition all the time her favorite plan of marrying the emperor had been thwarted in part by the difficulties which her friendsher father and her aunt especiallyhad contrived secretly to throw in the way while outwardly and ostensibly they appeared to be doing all in their power to promote her wishes they did not wish to have her married at all as by this event the management of her vast fortune would pass out of their hands she discovered this their double dealing when it was too late and she was overwhelmed with vexation and chagrin  things being in this state charles sent a special messenger at one time from the hague with instructions to make a formal proposal to anne maria and to see if he could not bring the affair to a close the name of this messenger was lord germain  the queen regent and her father urged anne maria now to consent to the proposal they told her that charless prospects were brighteningthat they themselves were going to render him powerful protectionthat he had already acquired several alliesthat there were whole provinces in england that were in his favor and that all ireland which was as it were a kingdom in itself was on his side whether they seriously desired that anne maria would consent to charless proposals or only urged for effect what they knew very well she would persist in refusing it is impossible to ascertain if this latter were their design it seemed likely to fail for anne maria appeared to yield she was sorry she said that the situation of affairs in paris was not such as to allow of the french government giving charles effectual help in gaining possession of the throne but still not withstanding that she was ready to do what ever they might think best to command  lord germain then said that he should proceed directly to holland and escort charles to france and he wanted anne maria to give him a direct and positive reply for if she would really accept his proposal he would come at once to court and claim her as his bride otherwise he must proceed to ireland for the state of his affairs demanded his presence there but if she would accept his proposal he would immediately come to paris and have the marriage ceremony performed and then he would remain afterward some days with her that she might enjoy the honors and distinctions to which she would become entitled as the queen consort of a mighty realm he would then if she liked the plan take her to saint germains where his mother her aunt was then residing and establish her there while he was recovering his kingdom or if she preferred it she might take up her residence in paris where she had been accustomed to live  to this the young lady replied that the last mentioned plan that is that she should continue to live at paris after being married to charles was one that she could not think of she should feel altogether unwilling to remain and enjoy the gayeties and festivities of paris while her husband was at the head of his armies exposed to all the dangers and privations of a camp nor should she consider it right to go on incurring the expenses which a lady of her rank and position must necessarily bear in such a city while he was perhaps embarrassed and distressed with the difficulties of providing funds for his own and his followers necessities she should feel in fact bound if she were to become his wife to do all in her power to assist him and it would end she foresaw in her having to dispose of all her property and expend the avails in aiding him to recover his kingdom this she said she confessed alarmed her it was a great sacrifice for her to make reared as she had been in opulence and luxury lord germain replied that all this was doubtless true but then on the other hand he would venture to remind her that there was no other suitable match for her in europe he then went on to name the principal personages the emperor of germany and the king of spain were both married some other monarch was just about to espouse a spanish princess others whom he named were too young others again too old and a certain prince whom he mentioned had been married he said these ten years and his wife was in excellent health so that every species of hope seemed to be cut off in that quarter  this conversation leading to no decisive result lord germain renewed the subject after a few days and pressed anne maria for a final answer she said now that she had a very high regard for queen henrietta and indeed a very strong affection for her so strong that she should be willing to waive for henriettas sake all her objections to the disadvantages of charless position but there was one objection which she felt that she could not surmount and that was his religion he was a protestant while she was a catholic charles must remove this difficulty himself which if he had any regard for her he certainly would be willing to do since she would have to make so many sacrifices for him lord germain however immediately discouraged this idea he said that the position of charles in respect to his kingdom was such as to render it impossible for him to change his religious faith in fact if he were to do so he would be compelled to give up at once all hope of ever getting possession of his throne anne maria knew this very well the plea however made an excellent excuse to defend herself with from lord germains importunities she adhered to it therefore pertinaciously the negotiation was broken off and lord germain went away  young adventurers like charles who wish to marry great heiresses have always to exercise a great deal of patience and to submit to a great many postponements and delays even though they are successful in the end and sovereign princes are not excepted any more than other men from this necessity dependent as woman is during all the earlier and all the later years of her life and subjected as she is to the control and too often alas to the caprice and injustice of man there is a periodbrief it is truewhen she is herself in power and such characters as anne maria like to exercise their authority while they feel that they possess it with a pretty high hand charles seems to have felt the necessity of submitting to the inconvenience of anne marias capricious delays and as long as she only continued to make excuses and objections instead of giving him a direct and positive refusal he was led to persevere accordingly not long after the conversations which his messenger had held with the lady as already described he determined to come himself to france and see if he could not accomplish something by his own personal exertions he accordingly advanced to peronne which was not far from the frontier and sent forward a courier to announce his approach the royal family concluded to go out in their carriages to meet him they were at this time at a famous royal resort a few leagues from paris called compiegne charles was to dine at compiegne and then to proceed on toward paris where he had business to transact connected with his political plans  anne maria gives a minute account of the ride of the royal family to meet charles on his approach to compiegne and of the interview with him on her part which attended it she dressed herself in the morning she says with great care and had her hair curled which she seldom did except on very special occasions when she entered the carriage to go out to meet the king the queen regent observing her appearance said archly how easy it is to tell when young ladies expect to meet their lovers anne maria says that she had a great mind to tell her in reply that it was easy for those who had had a great deal of experience in preparing to meet lovers themselves she did not however say this and the forbearance seems to show that there was after all the latent element of discretion and respect for superiors in her character though it showed itself so seldom in action  they rode out several miles to meet the coming king and when the two parties met they all alighted and saluted each other by the road side the ladies and gentlemen that accompanied them standing around anne maria noticed that charles addressed the king and queen regent first and then her after a short delay they got into their carriages againking charles entering the carriage with their majesties and anne mariaand they rode together thus back to compiegne  anne maria however does not seem to have been in a mood to be pleased she says that charles began to talk with the kinglouis xivwho was now twelve years old about the dogs and horses and the hunting customs in the country of the prince of orange he talked on these subjects fluently enough in the french language but when afterward the queen regent who would naturally be interested in a different class of topics asked him about the affairs of his own kingdom and his plans for recovering it he excused himself by saying that he did not speak french well enough to give her the information anne maria says she determined from that moment not to conclude the marriage for i conceived a very poor opinion of him being a king and at his age to have no knowledge of his affairs such minds as anne marias are seldom very logical but such an inference as this that he was ignorant of his own affairs because he declined explaining plans whose success depended on secrecy in such a company as that and in a language with which though he could talk about dogs and horses in it he was still very imperfectly acquainted is far too great a jump from premises to conclusion to be honestly made it is very evident that anne maria was not disposed to be pleased  they arrived at compiegne as the king was going on that evening dinner was served soon after they arrived anne maria says he ate no ortolans a very expensive and rare dish of little birds which had been prepared expressly for this dinner in honor of the royal guest footnote the ortolan is a very small bird which is fattened in lamp lighted rooms at great expense because it is found to be of a more delicate flavor when excluded from the daylight they come from the island of cyprus and have been famous in every age of the world as an article of royal luxury but flung himself upon a piece of beef and a shoulder of mutton as if there had been nothing else at table after dinner when we were in the drawing room the queen amused herself with the other ladies and gentlemen and left him with me he was a quarter of an hour without speaking a word but i am willing to believe that his silence was the result of respect rather than any want of passion though on this occasion i frankly confess i could have wished it less plainly exhibited after a while getting tired of his tediousness i called another lady to my side to see if she could not make him talk she succeeded presently one of the gentlemen of the party came to me and said he kept looking at you all dinner time and is looking at you still to which i replied he has plenty of time to look at me before he will please me if he does not speak the gentleman rejoined oh he has said tender things enough to you no doubt only you dont like to admit it to which i answered come and seat yourself by me the next time he is at my side and hear for yourself how he talks about it she says she then went and addressed the king herself asking him various questions about persons who were in his suite and that he answered them all with an air of mere common politeness without any gallantry at all  finally the hour for the departure of charles and his party arrived and the carriages came to the door the french king together with his mother and anne maria and the usual attendants accompanied them some miles into the forest on their way and then all alighting as they had done when they met in the morning they took leave of each other with the usual ceremonies of such occasions charles after bidding king louis farewell advanced with lord germain who was present in his suite at that time to anne maria and she gives the following rather petulant account of what passed i believe said charles that my lord germain who speaks french better than i do has explained to you my sentiments and my intention i am your very obedient servant i answered that i was equally his obedient servant germain paid me a great number of compliments the king standing by after they were over the king bowed and departed  charles who had been all his life living roughly in camps felt naturally ill at ease in the brilliant scenes of ceremony and splendor which the french court presented and this embarrassment was greatly increased by the haughty air and manner and the ill concealed raillery of the lady whose favorable regard he was so anxious to secure his imperfect knowledge of the language and his sense of the gloomy uncertainty of his own prospects in life tended strongly to increase his distrust of himself and his timidity we should have wished that he could have experienced somewhat kinder treatment from the object of his regard were it not that his character and especially his subsequent history show that he was entirely mercenary and selfish himself in seeking her hand if we can ever in any instance pardon the caprice and wanton cruelty of a coquette it is when these qualities are exercised in thwarting the designs of a heartless speculator who is endeavoring to fill his coffers with money by offering in exchange for it a mere worthless counterfeit of love  charles seems to have been totally discouraged by the result of this unfortunate dinner party at compiegne he went to paris and from paris he went to st germains where he remained for several months with his mother revolving in his mind his fallen fortunes and forming almost hopeless schemes for seeking to restore them in the mean time the wife whom the emperor of germany had married instead of anne maria died and the young belle sprang immediately into the excitement of a new hope of attaining the great object of her ambition after all the emperor was fifty years of age and had four children but he was the emperor of germany and that made amends for all anne maria immediately began to lay her trains again for becoming his bride what her plans were and how they succeeded we shall perhaps have occasion hereafter to describe  though her heart was thus set upon having the emperor for her husband she did not like in the mean time quite to give up her younger and more agreeable beau besides her plans of marrying the emperor might fail and charles might succeed in recovering his kingdom it was best therefore not to bring the negotiation with him to too absolute a close when the time arrived therefore for charles to take his departure she thought she would just ride out to st germains and pay her respects to queen henrietta and bid the young king goodby  neither queen henrietta nor her son attempted to renew the negotiation of his suite on the occasion of this visit the queen told anne maria on the other hand that she supposed she ought to congratulate her on the death of the empress of germany for though the negotiation for her marriage with him had failed on a former occasion she had no doubt it would be resumed now and would be successful anne maria replied with an air of indifference that she did not know or think any thing about it the queen then said that she knew of a young man not very far from them who thought that a king of nineteen years of age was better for a husband than a man of fifty a widower with four children even if he was an emperor however said she we do not know what turn things may take my son may succeed in recovering his kingdom and then perhaps if you should be in a situation to do so you may listen more favorably to his addresses  anne maria was not to return directly back to paris she was going to visit her sisters who lived at a little distance beyond the duke of york that is henriettas son james then fourteen or fifteen years old proposed to accompany her she consented charles then proposed to go too anne maria objected to this saying that it was not quite proper she had no objection to jamess going as he was a mere youth queen henrietta removed her objection by offering to join the party herself so they all went together anne maria says that charles treated her with great politeness and attention all the way and paid her many compliments but made no attempt to bring up again in any way the question of his suit she was very glad he did not she says for her mind being now occupied with the plan of marrying the emperor nothing that he could have said would have done any good  thus the question was considered as virtually settled and king charles soon after turned his thoughts toward executing the plans which he had been long revolving for the recovery of his kingdom     chapter vii  the royal oak of boscobel    it was in june 1650 about eighteen months after the decapitation of his father that charles was ready to set out on his expedition to attempt the recovery of his rights to the english throne he was but twenty years of age he took with him no army no supplies no resources he had a small number of attendants and followers personally interested themselves in his success and animated also probably by some degree of disinterested attachment to him it was however on the whole a desperate enterprise queen henrietta in her retirement at the louvre felt very anxious about the result of it charles himself too notwithstanding his own buoyant and sanguine temperament and the natural confidence and hope pertaining to his years must have felt many forebodings but his condition on the continent was getting every month more and more destitute and forlorn he was a mere guest wherever he went and destitute of means as he was he found himself continually sinking in public consideration money as well as rank is very essentially necessary to make a relative a welcome guest for any long time in aristocratic circles charles concluded therefore that all things considered it was best for him to make a desperate effort to recover his kingdoms  his kingdoms were three england scotland and ireland ireland was a conquered kingdom scotland like england had descended to him from his ancestors for his grandfather james vi was king of scotland and being on his mothers side a descendant of an english king he was of course one of the heirs of the english crown and on the failure of the other heirs he succeeded to that crown retaining still his own thus both kingdoms descended to charles  it was only the english kingdom that had really rebelled against and put to death king charless father there had been a great deal of difficulty in scotland it is true and the republican spirit had spread quite extensively in that country still affairs had not proceeded to such extremities there the scotch had in some degree joined with the english in resisting charles the first but it was not their wish to throw off the royal authority altogether they abhorred episcopacy in the church but were well enough contented with monarchy in the state accordingly soon after the death of the father they had opened negotiations with the son and had manifested their willingness to acknowledge him as their king on certain conditions which they undertook to prescribe to him it is very hard for a king to hold his scepter on conditions prescribed by his people charles tried every possible means to avoid submitting to this necessity he found however that the only possible avenue of access to england was by first getting some sort of possession of scotland and so signifying his willingness to comply with the scotch demands he set sail from holland with his court moved north ward with his little squadron over the waters of the german ocean and at length made port in the frith of cromarty in the north of scotland  the scotch government having but little faith in the royal word of such a youth as charles would not allow him to land until he had formally signed their covenant by which he bound himself to the conditions which they had thought it necessary to impose he then landed but he found his situation very far from such as comported with his ideas of royal authority and state charles was a gay dissipated reckless young man the men whom he had to deal with were stern sedate and rigid religionists they were scandalized at the looseness and irregularity of his character and manners he was vexed and tormented by what he considered their ascetic bigotry by the restraints which they were disposed to put upon his conduct and the limits with which they insisted on bounding his authority long negotiations and debates ensued each party becoming more and more irritated against the other at last on one occasion charles lost his patience entirely and made his escape into the mountains in hopes to raise an army there among the clans of wild highlanders who accustomed from infancy to the most implicit obedience to their chieftains are always very loyal to their king the scotch nobles however not wishing to drive him to extremities sent for him to come back and both parties becoming after this somewhat more considerate and accommodating they at length came to an agreement and proceeding together to scone a village some miles north of edinburgh they crowned charles king of scotland in a venerable abbey there the ancient place of coronation for all the monarchs of the scottish line  in the mean time cromwell who was at the head of the republican government of england knowing very well that charless plan would be to march into england as soon as he could mature his arrangements for such an enterprise determined to anticipate this design by declaring war himself against scotland and marching an army there  charles felt comparatively little interest in what became of scotland his aim was england he knew or supposed that there was a very large portion of the english people who secretly favored his cause and he believed that if he could once cross the frontier even with a small army these his secret friends would all rise at once and flock to his standard still he attempted for a time to resist cromwell in scotland but without success cromwell penetrated to the heart of the country and actually passed the army of charles in these circumstances charles resolved to leave scotland to its fate and boldly to cross the english frontier to see what he could do by raising his standard in his southern kingdom the army acceded to this plan with acclamations the king accordingly put his forces in motion crossed the frontier issued his manifestoes and sent around couriers and heralds announcing to the whole population that their king had come and summoning all his subjects to arm themselves and hasten to his aid this was in the summer of 1651 the year after his landing in scotland  it certainly was a very bold and almost desperate measure and the reader whether monarchist or republican can hardly help wishing the young adventurer success the romantic enterprise was however destined to fail the people of england were not yet prepared to return to royalty some few of the ancient noble families and country gentlemen adhered to the kings cause but they came in to join his ranks very slowly those who were in favor of the king were called cavaliers the other party were called roundheads queen henrietta maria had given them the name on account of their manner of wearing their hair cut short and close to their heads all around while the gay cavaliers cultivated their locks which hung in long curls down upon their shoulders the cavaliers it turned out were few while the roundheads filled the land  it was however impossible for charles to retreat since cromwell was behind him for cromwell as soon as he found that his enemy had actually gone into england paused only long enough to recover from his surprise and then made all haste to follow him the two armies thus moved down through the very heart of england carrying every where as they went universal terror confusion and dismay the whole country was thrown into extreme excitement every body was called upon to take sides and thousands were perplexed and undecided which side to take families were divided brothers separated fathers and sons were ready to fight each other in their insane zeal the latter for the parliament the former for the king the whole country was filled with rumors messengers parties of soldiers going to and fro and troops of horsemen with robberies plunderings murders and other deeds of violence without number and all the other elements of confusion and misery which arouse the whole population of a country to terror and distress and mar the very face of nature in time of civil war what dreadful struggles man will make to gain the pleasure of ruling his fellow man along the frontiers of england and wales there flows the beautiful river severn which widens majestically at its mouth and passes by the bristol channel to the sea one of the largest towns upon this river is worcester it was in those days strongly fortified it stands on the eastern side of the river with a great bridge opposite one of the gates leading across the severn in the direction toward wales there are other bridges on the stream both above and below and many towns and villages in the vicinity the whole presenting at ordinary times a delightful scene of industry and peace  worcester is perhaps three hundred miles from the frontiers of scotland on the way to london though somewhat to the westward of the direct route charless destination was the capital he pushed on notwithstanding the difficulties and disappointments which embarrassed his march until at last when he reached the banks of the severn he found he could go no further his troops and his officers were wearied faint and discouraged his hopes had not been realized and while it was obviously dangerous to stop it seemed still more dangerous to go on however as the authorities of worcester were disposed to take sides with the king charles determined to stop there for a little time at all events to refresh his army and consider what to do  he was received in the city with all due honors he was proclaimed king on the following day with great parade and loud acclamations he established a camp in the neighborhood of the city he issued great proclamations calling upon all the people of the surrounding country to come and espouse his cause he established his court organized his privy council and in a word perfected on a somewhat humble scale it is true all the arrangements proper to the condition of a monarch in his capital he began perhaps in fact to imagine himself really a king if he did so however the illusion was soon dispelled in one short week cromwells army came on filling all the avenues of approach to the city and exhibiting a force far too great apparently either for charles to meet in battle or to defend himself from in a siege  charless forces fought several preliminary battles and skirmishes in resisting the attempts of cromwells columns to get possession of the bridges and fords by which they were to cross the river these contests resulted always in the same way the detachments which charles had sent forward to defend these points were one after another driven in while charles with his council of war around him watched from the top of the tower of a church within the city this gradual and irresistible advance of his determined enemy with an anxiety which gradually deepened into dismay  the king finding his situation now desperate determined to make one final attempt to retrieve his fallen fortunes he formed his troops in array and marched out to give the advancing army battle he put himself at the head of a troop of highlanders and fought in person with the courage and recklessness of despair the officers knew full well that it was a question of victory or death for if they did not conquer they must die either by wounds on the field of battle or else if taken prisoners by being hung as traitors or beheaded in the tower all possibility of escape entrapped and surrounded as they were in the very heart of the country hundreds of miles from the frontiers seemed utterly hopeless they fought therefore with reckless and desperate fury but all was in vain they were repulsed and driven in on all sides and the soldiers fled at length carrying the officers with them in tumult and disorder back through the gates into the city  an army flying in confusion to seek refuge in a city can not shut the gates behind them against their pursuers in fact in such a scene of terror and dismay there is no order no obedience no composure at the gate where charles endeavored to get back into the city he found the way choked up by a heavy ammunition cart which had been entangled there one of the oxen that had been drawing it being killed the throngs of men and horsemen were stopped by this disaster the king dismounted abandoned his horse and made his way through and over the obstruction as he could when he got into the city he found all in confusion there his men were throwing away their arms and pressing onward in their flight he lightened his own burdens by laying aside the heaviest of his armor procured another horse and rode up and down among his men urging and entreating them to form again and face the enemy he plead the justice of his cause their duty to be faithful to their rightful sovereign and every other argument which was capable of being expressed in the shouts and vociferations which in such a scene constitute the only kind of communication possible with panic stricken men and when he found that all was in vain he said in despair that he would rather they would shoot him on the spot than let him live to witness such an abandonment of his cause by the only friends and followers that had been left to him  the powerful influence which these expostulations would otherwise have had was lost and overborne in the torrent of confusion and terror which was spreading through all the streets of the city the army of cromwell forced their passage in and fought their way from street to street wherever they found any remaining resistance some of the kings troops were hemmed up in corners and cut to pieces others somewhat more fortunate sought protection in towers and bastions where they could make some sort of conditions with their victorious enemy before surrendering charles himself finding that all was lost made his escape at last from the city at six oclock in the evening at the head of a troop of horse he could not however endure the thought of giving up the contest after all again and again as he slowly retreated he stopped to face about and to urge his men to consent to turn back again and encounter the enemy their last halt was upon a bridge half a mile from the city here the king held a consultation with the few remaining counselors and officers that were with him surveying with them the routed and flying bodies of men who were now throwing away their arms and dispersing in all directions in a state of hopeless disorganization and despair the king saw plainly that his cause was irretrievably ruined and they all agreed that nothing now remained for them but to make their escape back to scotland if by any possibility that could now be done  but how should they accomplish this end to follow the multitude of defeated soldiers would be to share the certain capture and death which awaited them and they were themselves all strangers to the country to go on inquiring all the way would only expose them to equally certain discovery and capture the first thing however obviously was to get away from the crowd charles and his attendants therefore turned aside from the high roadthere were with the king fifty or sixty officers and noblemen all mounted menand moved along in such secluded bypaths as they could find the king wished to diminish even this number of followers but he could not get any of them to leave him he complained afterward in the account which he gave of these adventures that though they would not fight for him when battle was to be given he could not get rid of them when the time came for flight  there was a servant of one of the gentlemen in the company who pretended to know the way and he accordingly undertook to guide the party but as soon as it became dark he got confused and lost and did not know what to do they contrived however to get another guide they went ten miles attracting no particular attention for at such a time of civil war a country is full of parties of men armed and unarmed going to and fro who are allowed generally to move without molestation as the inhabitants are only anxious to have as little as possible to say to them that they may the sooner be gone the royal party assumed the air and manner of one of these bands as long as daylight lasted and when that was gone they went more securely and at their ease after proceeding ten miles they stopped at an obscure inn where they took some drink and a little bread and then resumed their journey consulting with one another as they went as to what it was best to do  about ten or twelve miles further on there was a somewhat wild and sequestered region in which there were two very secluded dwellings about half a mile from each other one of these residences was named boscobel the name had been given to it by a guest of the proprietor at an entertainment which the latter had given from the italian words bosco bello which mean beautiful grove it was in or near a wood and away from all high roads having been built probably like many other of the dwellings reared in those days as a place of retreat in the preceding reigns of charles and elizabeth the catholics who were called popish recusants on account of their refusing to take an oath acknowledging the supremacy of the british sovereign over the english church had to resort to all possible modes of escape from protestant persecution they built these retreats in retired and secluded places and constructed all sorts of concealed and secure hiding places within them in the partitions and walls where men whose lives were in danger might be concealed for many days boscobel was such a mansion in fact one of the kings generals the earl of derby had been concealed in it but a short time before the king inquired particularly about it and was induced himself to seek refuge there  this house belonged to a family of giffards one of whom was in the suite of king charles at this time there was another mansion about half a mile distant this other place had been originally in the catholic days a convent and the nuns who inhabited it dressed in white they were called accordingly the white ladies and the place itself received the same name which it retained after the sisters were gone mr giffard recommended going to the white ladies first he wanted in fact to contrive some way to relieve the king of the encumbrance of so large a troop before going to boscobel  they went accordingly to the white ladies neither of the houses was occupied at this time by the proprietors but were in charge of housekeepers and servants among the tenants upon the estate there were several brothers of the name of penderel they were woodmen and farm servants living at different places in the neighborhood and having charge some of them of the houses above described one of the penderels was at the white ladies he let the fugitives in tired exhausted and hungry as they were with the fatigue of marching nearly all the night they sent immediately for richard penderel who lived in a farm house nearby and for another brother who was at boscobel they took the king into an inner room and immediately commenced the work of effectually disguising him  they gave him clothes belonging to some of the servants of the family and destroyed his own the king had about his person a watch and some costly decorations such as orders of knighthood set in jewels which would betray his rank if found in his possession these the king distributed among his friends intrusting them to the charge of such as he judged most likely to effect their escape they then cut off his hair short all over thus making him a roundhead instead of a cavalier they rubbed soot from the fire place over his face to change the expression of his features and complexion they gave him thus in all respects as nearly as possible the guise of a squalid peasant and laborer of the humblest class accustomed to the privations and to the habits of poverty  in the mean time richard penderel arrived perhaps an intimation had been given him of the wishes of the king to be relieved of his company of followers at any rate he urged the whole retinue as soon as he came to the house to press forward without any delay as there was a detachment of cromwells forces he said at three miles distance who might be expected at any moment to come in pursuit of them giffard brought penderel then into the inner room to which the king had retired this is the king said he i commit him to your charge take care of him  richard undertook the trust he told the king that he must immediately leave that place and he conducted him secretly all disguised as he was out of a postern door without making known his design to any of his followers except the two or three who were in immediate attendance upon him he led him away about half a mile into a wood and concealing him there left him alone saying he would go and see what intelligence he could obtain and presently return again the troop of followers in the mean time from whom the king had been so desirous to get free when they found that he was gone mounted their horses and rode away to escape the danger with which richard had threatened them but alas for the unhappy fugitives they did not get far in their flight they were overtaken attacked conquered captured and treated as traitors some were shot one was beheaded and others were shut up in prisons where they pined in hopeless privation and suffering for many years there was however one of the kings followers who did not go away with the rest it was lord wilmot an influential nobleman who concealed himself in the vicinity and kept near the king in all his subsequent wanderings  but we must return to the king in the wood it was about sunrise when he was left there the morning after the battle it rained the king tried in vain to find a shelter under the trees of the forest the trees themselves were soon thoroughly saturated and they received the driving rain from the skies only to let the water fall in heavier drops upon the poor fugitives defenseless head richard borrowed a blanket at a cottage near thinking that it would afford some protection and brought it to his charge the king folded it up to make a cushion to sit upon for worn out as he was with hard fighting all the day before and hard riding all the night he could not stand so he chose to use his blanket as a protection from the wet ground beneath him and to take the rain upon his head as it fell  richard sent a peasants wife to him presently with some food charles who never had any great respect for the female sex was alarmed to find that a woman had been entrusted with such a secret  my good woman said he can you be faithful to a distressed cavalier  yes sir said she i will die rather than betray you  charles had in fact no occasion to fear woman is indeed communicative and confiding and often in unguarded hours reveals indiscreetly what it would have been better to have withheld but in all cases where real and important trusts are committed to her keeping there is no human fidelity which can be more safely relied upon than hers  charles remained in the wood all the day exposed to the pelting of the storm there was a road in sight a sort of byway leading across the country and the monarch beguiled the weary hours as well as he could by watching this road from under the trees to see if any soldiers came along there was one troop that appeared but it passed directly by marching heavily through the mud and rain the men intent apparently only on reaching their journeys end when night came on richard penderel returned approaching cautiously and finding all safe took the king into the house with him they brought him to the fire changed and dried his clothes and gave him supper the homeless monarch once more enjoyed the luxuries of warmth and shelter  during all the day while he had been alone in the wood he had been revolving in his mind the strange circumstances of his situation vainly endeavoring for many hours to realize what seemed at first like a dreadful dream could it be really true that he the monarch of three kingdoms so recently at the head of a victorious army and surrounded by generals and officers of state was now a friendless and solitary fugitive without even a place to hide his head from the cold autumnal storm it seemed at first a dream but it soon became a reality and he began to ponder in every form the question what he should do he looked east west north and south but could not see in any quarter any hope of succor or any reasonable prospect of escape he however arrived at the conclusion before night came on that it would be on the whole the best plan for him to attempt to escape into wales  he was very near the frontier of that country there was no difficulty to be apprehended on the road thither excepting in the crossing of the severn which as has already been remarked flows from north to south not far from the line of the frontier he thought too that if he could once succeed in getting into wales he could find secure retreats among the mountains there until he should be able to make his way to some seaport on the coast trading with france and so find his way back across the channel he proposed this plan to richard in the evening and asked him to accompany him as his guide richard readily consented and the arrangements for the journey were made they adjusted the kings dress again to complete his disguise and richard gave him a billhooka sort of woodmans toolto carry in his hand it was agreed also that his name should be will jones so far as there should be any necessity for designating him by a name in the progress of the journey  they set out at nine oclock that same night in the darkness and rain they wished to get to madely a town near the river before the morning richard knew a mr woolf there a friend of the royalist cause who he thought would shelter them and aid them in getting across the river they went on very well for some time until they came to a stream a branch of the severn where there was a bridge and on the other side a mill the miller happened to be watching that night at his door at such times everybody is on the alert suspecting mischief or danger in every unusual sight or sound  hearing the footsteps he called out who goes there  neighbors replied richard the king was silent he had been previously charged by richard not to speak except when it could not possibly be avoided as he had not the accent of the country  stop then said the miller if you be neighbors the travelers only pressed forward the faster for this challenge stop repeated the miller if you be neighbors or i will knock you down and he ran out in pursuit of them armed apparently with the means of executing his threat richard fled the king closely following him they turned into a lane and ran a long distance the way being in many places so dark that the king in following richard was guided only by the sound of his footsteps and the creaking of the leather dress which such peasants were accustomed in those days to wear they crept along however as silently and yet as rapidly as possible until at length richard turned suddenly aside leaped over a sort of gap in the hedge and crouched down in the trench on the other side here they remained for some time listening to ascertain whether they were pursued when they found that all was still they crept forth from their hiding places regained the road and went on their way  at length they arrived at the town richard left the king concealed in an obscure corner of the street while he went to the house of mr woolf to see if he could obtain admission all was dark and still he knocked till he had aroused some of the family and finally brought mr woolf to the door  he told mr woolf that he came to ask shelter for a gentleman who was wishing to get into wales and who could not safely travel by day mr woolf hesitated and began to ask for further information in respect to the stranger richard said that he was an officer who had made his escape from the battle of worcester then said mr woolf i should hazard my life by concealing him which i should not be willing to do for any body unless it were the king richard then told him that it was his majesty on hearing this mr woolf decided at once to admit and conceal the travelers and richard went back to bring the king  when they arrived at the house they found mr woolf making preparations for their reception they placed the king by the fire to warm and dry his clothes and they gave him such food as could be provided on so sudden an emergency as the morning was now approaching it was necessary to adopt some plan of concealment for the day and mr woolf decided upon concealing his guests in his barn he said that there were holes and hiding places built in his house but that they had all been discovered on some previous search and in case of any suspicion or alarm the officers would go directly to them all he took the travelers accordingly to the barn and concealed them there among the hay he said that he would himself during the day make inquiries in respect to the practicability of their going on upon their journey and come and report to them in the evening  accordingly when the evening came mr woolf returned relieved them from their confinement and took them back again to the house his report however in respect to the continuance of their journey was very unfavorable he thought it would be impossible he said for them to cross the severn the republican forces had stationed guards at all the bridges ferries and fords and at every other practicable place of crossing and no one was allowed to pass without a strict examination the country was greatly excited too with the intelligence of the kings escape rewards were offered for his apprehension and heavy penalties denounced upon all who should harbor or conceal him under these circumstances mr woolf recommended that charles should go back to boscobel and conceal himself as securely as possible there until some plan could be devised for effecting his escape from the country  the king had no alternative but to accede to this plan he waited at mr woolfs house till midnight in order that the movement in the streets of the town might have time entirely to subside and then disappointed and discouraged by the failure of his hopes he prepared to set out upon his return mr woolf made some changes in his disguise and bathed his face in a decoction of walnut leaves which he had prepared during the day to alter his complexion which was naturally very dark and peculiar and thus exposed him to danger of discovery when all was ready the two travelers bade their kind host farewell and crept forth again through the silent streets to return by the way they came back to boscobel  they went on very well till they began to approach the branch stream where they had met with their adventure with the miller they could not cross this stream by the bridge without going by the mill again which they were both afraid to do the king proposed that they should go a little way below and ford the stream richard was afraid to attempt this as he could not swim and as the night was dark and the current rapid there would be imminent danger of their getting beyond their depth charles said that he could swim and that he would accordingly go first and try the water they groped their way down therefore to the bank and charles leaving his guide upon the land waded in and soon disappeared from view as he receded from the shore he returned however after a short time in safety and reported the passage practicable as the water was only three or four feet deep so taking richard by the hand he led him into the stream it was a dismal and dangerous undertaking wading thus through a deep and rapid current in darkness and cold but they succeeded in passing safely over  they reached boscobel before the morning dawned and richard when they arrived left the king in the wood while he went toward the house to reconnoiter and see if all was safe he found within an officer of the kings army a certain colonel carlis who had fled from worcester some time after the king had left the field and being acquainted with the situation of boscobel had sought refuge there william penderel who had remained in charge of boscobel having received and secreted him when he arrived  richard and william brought colonel carlis out into the wood to see the king they found him sitting upon the ground at the foot of a tree entirely exhausted he was worn out with hardship and fatigue they took him to the house they brought him to the fire and gave him some food the colonel drew off his majestys heavy peasant shoes and coarse stockings they were soaked with water and full of gravel the colonel bathed his feet which were sadly swollen and blistered and as there were no other shoes in the house which would answer for him to wear dame penderel warmed and dried those which the colonel had taken off by filling them with hot ashes from the fire and then put them on again  the king continued to enjoy such sort of comforts as these during the night but when the morning drew near it became necessary to look out for some place of concealment the penderels thought that no place within the house would be safe for there was danger every hour of the arrival of a band of soldiers who would not fail to search the mansion most effectually in every part there was the wood near by which was very secluded and solitary but still they feared that in case of a search the wood would be explored as effectually as the dwelling under these circumstances carlis was looking around perplexed and uncertain not knowing what to do when he perceived some scattered oaks standing by themselves in a field not far from the house one of which seemed to be so full and dense in its foliage as to afford some hope of concealment there the tree it seems had been headed down once or twice and this pruning had had the effect usual in such cases of making the branches spread and grow very thick and full the colonel thought that though in making a search for fugitives men might very naturally explore a thicket or a grove they would not probably think of examining a detached and solitary tree he proposed accordingly that the king and himself should climb up into this spreading oak and conceal themselves for the day among its branches  the king consented to this plan they took some provisions therefore as soon as the day began to dawn and something to answer the purpose of a cushion and proceeded to the tree by the help of william and richard the king and the colonel climbed up and established themselves in the top the colonel placed the cushion for the king on the best support among the limbs that he could find the bread and cheese and a small bottle of beer which richard and william had brought for their days supplies they suspended to a branch within their reach the colonel then seated himself a little above the king in such a manner that the monarchs head could rest conveniently in his lap and in as easy a position as it was possible under such circumstances to attain richard and william then after surveying the place of retreat all around from below in order to be sure that the concealment afforded by the foliage was every where complete went away promising to keep faithful watch during the day and to return in the evening all things being thus arranged in the oak the colonel bade his majesty to close his eyes and go to sleep saying that he would take good care that he did not fall the king followed his directions and slept safely for many hours  in the course of the day the king and carlis saw by means of the openings between the leaves through which as through loop holes in a tower they continually reconnoitered the surrounding fields men passing to and fro some of whom they imagined to be soldiers searching the wood they were not however themselves molested they passed the day undisturbed except by the incessant anxiety and alarm which they necessarily suffered and the fatigue and pain which must have become almost intolerable before night from their constrained and comfortless position night however came at last and relieved them from their duress they descended from the tree and stole back cautiously to the house the king resolving that he could not bear such hardship another day and that they must accordingly find some other hiding place for him on the morrow we can scarcely be surprised at this decision a wild beast could hardly have endured a second day in such a lair  other plans of concealment for the king were accordingly formed that night and measures were soon concerted as we shall see in the next chapter to effect his escape from the country the old tree however which had sheltered him so safely was not forgotten in after years when the monarch was restored to his throne and the story of his dangers and his escape was made known throughout the kingdom thousands of visitors came to look upon the faithful tree which had thus afforded his majesty its unconscious but effectual protection every one took away a leaf or a sprig for a souvenir and when at last the proprietor found that there was danger that the whole tree would be carried away unless he interposed he fenced it in and tilled the ground around it to defend it from further mutilation it has borne the name of the royal oak from that time to the present day and has been the theme of narrators and poets without number who have celebrated its praises in every conceivable form of composition there is however probably no one of them all who has done more for the wide extension of its fame among all the ranks and gradations of society than the unknown author of the humble distich    the royal oak it was the tree   that saved his royal majesty     chapter viii  the kings escape to france    when the king and carlis came into the house again on the evening after their wearisome days confinement in the tree dame penderel had some chickens prepared for his majestys supper which he enjoyed as a great and unexpected luxury they showed him too the hiding hole built in the walls where the earl of derby had been concealed and where they proposed that he should be lodged for the night there was room in it to lay down a small straw pallet for a bed the king thought it would be very secure and was confirmed in his determination not to go again to the oak before his majesty retired carlis asked him what he would like to have to eat on the morrow he said that he should like some mutton carlis assented and bidding his master good night he left him to his repose  there was no mutton in the house and richard and william both agreed that it would be unsafe for either of them to procure any since as they were not accustomed to purchase such food their doing so now would awaken suspicion that they had some unusual guest to provide for the colonel accordingly undertook himself to obtain the supply  getting the necessary directions therefore from richard and william he went to the house of a farmer at some little distancea tenant he was on the boscobel estateand groped his way to the sheepcote he selected an animal such as he thought suitable for his purpose and butchered it with his dagger he then went back to the house and sent william penderel to bring the plunder home william dressed a leg of the mutton and sent it in the morning into the room which they had assigned to the king near his hiding hole the king was overjoyed at the prospect of this feast he called for a carving knife and a frying pan he cut off some callops from the joint and then after frying the meat with carliss assistance they ate it together  the king becoming now somewhat accustomed to his situation began to grow a little more bold he walked in a little gallery which opened from his room there was a window in this gallery which commanded a view of the road the king kept watch carefully at this window as he walked to and fro that he might observe the first appearance of any enemys approach it was observed too that he apparently spent some time here in exercises of devotion imploring probably the protection of heaven in this his hour of danger and distress the vows and promises which he doubtless made were however all forgotten as usual in such cases when safety and prosperity came again  there was a little garden too near the house with an eminence at the further end of it where there was an arbor with a stone table and seats about it it was retired and yet being in an elevated position it answered like the window of the gallery in the house the double purpose of a hiding place and a watch tower it was far more comfortable and probably much more safe than the wretched nest in the tree of the day before for were the king discovered in the arbor there would be some chances of escape from detection still remaining but to have been found in the tree would have been certain destruction  in the mean time the penderels had had messengers out during the saturday and sunday communicating with certain known friends of the king in the neighboring towns and endeavoring to concert some plan for his escape they were successful in these consultations and be fore sunday night a plan was formed it seems there was a certain colonel lane whose wife had obtained a pass from the authorities of the republican army to go to bristol on the occasion of the sickness of a relative and to take with her a man servant bristol was a hundred miles to the southward near the mouth of the severn it was thought that if the king should reach this place he could perhaps succeed afterward in making his way to the southern coast of england and embarking there at some seaport for france the plan was accordingly formed for mrs lane to go as she had designed on this journey and to take the king along with her in the guise of her servant the arrangements were all made and the king was to be met in a wood five or six miles from boscobel early on monday morning by some trusty friends who were afterward to conceal him for a time in their houses until all things should be ready for the journey  the king found however when the morning approached that his feet were in such a condition that he could not walk they accordingly procured a horse belonging to one of the penderels and put him upon it the brothers all accompanied him as he went away they were armed with concealed weapons intending if they were attacked by any small party to defend the king with their lives they however went on without any molestation it was a dark and rainy night nights are seldom otherwise in england in september the brothers penderel six of them in all guided the king along through the darkness and rain until they were within a mile or two of the appointed place of meeting where the king dismounted for the purpose of walking the rest of way for greater safety and three of the brothers taking the horse with them returned the rest went on and after delivering the king safely into the hands of his friends who were waiting at the appointed place to receive him bade his majesty farewell and expressing their good wishes for the safe accomplishment of his escape they returned to boscobel  they now altered the kings disguise in some degree to accommodate the change in his assumed character from that of a peasant of the woods to a respectable farmers son such as would be a suitable traveling attendant for an english dame and they gave him the new name of william jackson in the place of will jones mrs lanes sisters husband was to go with them a part of the way and there was another gentleman and lady also of the party so they were five in all the horses were brought to the door when all was ready just in the edge of the evening the pretended attendant standing respectfully by with his hat under his arm he was to ride upon the same horse with mrs lane the lady being seated on a pillion behind him the family assembled to bid the party farewell none either of the travelers or of the spectators except mrs lane and her brotherinlaw having any idea that the meek looking william jackson was any other than what he seemed  they traveled on day after day meeting with various adventures and apparently with narrow escapes at one time a shoe was off from the horses foot and the king stopped at a blacksmiths to have it replaced while the smith was busy at the work the king standing by asked him what news no news said the smith that i know of since the grand news of beating the rogues the scots at worcester the king asked if any of the english officers who were with the scots had been taken since the battle some had been captured the smith replied but he could not learn that the rogue charles stuart had been taken the king then told him that if that rogue were taken he deserved to be hanged more than all the rest for bringing the scots in you speak like an honest man said the smith soon after the work was done and charles led the horse away  at another time when the party had stopped for the night the king in accordance with his assumed character went to the kitchen they were roasting some meat with a jack a machine used much in those days to keep meat while roasting in slow rotation before the fire the jack had run down they asked the pretended william jackson to wind it up in trying to do it he attempted to wind it the wrong way the cook in ridiculing his awkwardness asked him what country he came from that he did not know how to wind up a jack the king meekly replied that he was the son of a poor tenant of colonel lanes and that they seldom had meat to roast at home and that when they had it they did not roast it with a jack the party at length arrived safely at their place of destination which was at the house of a mrs norton at a place called leigh about three miles from bristol here the whole party were received and in order to seclude the king as much as possible from observation mrs lane pretended that he was in very feeble health and he was accordingly a good deal confined to his room the disease which they selected for him was an intermittent fever which came on only at intervals this would account for his being sometimes apparently pretty well and allowed him occasionally when tired of being shut up in his room to come down and join the other servants and hear their conversation  there was an old servant of the family named pope a butler to whose care the pretended william jackson was specially confided on the following morning after his arrival charles feeling notwithstanding his fever a good appetite after the fatigues of his journey went down to get his breakfast and while there some men came in friends of the servants and pope brought out a luncheon of bread and ale and placed it before them while they were eating it they began to talk about the battle of worcester and one of the men described it so accurately that the king perceived that he must have been there on questioning him more particularly the man said that he was a soldier in the kings army and he began to describe the person and appearance of the king charles was alarmed and very soon rose and went away pope who had had it seems his suspicions before was now confirmed in them he went to mrs lane and told her that he knew very well that their stranger guest was the king she denied most positively that it was so but she immediately took measures to communicate the conversation to charles the result of their consultations and of their inquiries about the character of pope for prudence and fidelity was to admit him to their confidence and endeavor to secure his aid he was faithful in keeping the secret and he rendered the king afterward a great deal of very efficient aid  there was a certain colonel wyndham whose name has become immortalized by his connection with the kings escape who lived at a place called trent not far from the southern coast of england after much deliberation and many inquiries it was decided that the king should proceed there while arrangements should be made for his embarkation when this plan was formed mrs lane received a pretended letter from home saying that her father was taken suddenly and dangerously sick and urging her immediate return they set out accordingly william having so far recovered from his fever as to be able to travel again  during all this time lord wilmot who has already been mentioned as a fellow fugitive with charles from the battle of worcester had followed the party of the king in his progress through the country under various disguises and by different modes of travel keeping near his royal master all the way and obtaining stolen interviews with him from time to time for consultation in this way each rendered the other very essential aid the two friends arrived at last at colonel wyndhams together mrs lane and her party here took leave of the king and returned northward toward her home  colonel wyndham was a personal acquaintance of the king he had been an officer under charles i in the civil wars preceding that monarchs captivity and death and charles who as prince of wales had made a campaign as will be recollected in the west of england before he went to france had had frequent intercourse with wyndham and bad great confidence in his fidelity the colonel had been at last shut up in a castle and had finally surrendered on such conditions as secured his own liberty and safety he had consequently since been allowed to live quietly at his own estate in trent though he was watched and suspected by the government as a known friend of the kings charles had of course great confidence in him he was very cordially received into his house and very securely secreted there  it would be dangerous for wyndham himself to do any thing openly in respect to finding a vessel to convey the king to france he accordingly engaged a trusty friend to go down to the seaport on the coast which was nearest to his residence and see what he could do this seaport was lyme or lymeregis as it is sometimes called it was about twentyfive miles from trent where wyndham resided toward the southwest and about the same distance to the eastward of exeter where charless mother had some years before sought refuge from her husbands enemies  colonel wyndhams messenger went to lyme he found there pretty soon the master of a small vessel which was accustomed to ply back and forth to one of the ports on the coast of france to carry merchandise the messenger after making inquiries and finding that the captain if captain he may be called was the right sort of man for such an enterprise obtained an interview with him and introduced conversation by asking when he expected to go back to france the captain replied that it would probably be some time before he should be able to make up another cargo how should you like to take some passengers said the messenger passengers inquired the captain yes rejoined the other there are two gentlemen here who wish to cross the channel privately and they are willing to pay fifty pounds to be landed at any port on the other side will you take them  the captain perceived that it was a serious business there was a proclamation out offering a reward for the apprehension of the king or charles stuart as they called him and also for other of the leaders at the battle of worcester all persons too were strictly prohibited from taking any one across the channel and to conceal the king or to connive in any way at his escape was death the captain however at length agreed to the proposal influenced as the colonels messenger supposed partly by the amount of his pay and partly by his interest in the royal cause he agreed to make his little vessel ready without delay  they did not think it prudent for the king to attempt to embark at lyme but there was a few miles to the eastward of it along the shore a small village named charmouth where there was a creek jutting up from the sea and a little pier sufficient for the landing of so small a vessel as the one they had engaged it was agreed that on an appointed day the king and lord wilmot were to come down to charmouth and take up their lodgings at the inn that in the night the captain was to sail out of the port of lyme in the most private manner possible and come to charmouth and that the king and wilmot who would in the mean time be watching from the inn when they saw the light of the approaching vessel should come down to the pier and embark and the captain then immediately sail away  the messenger accordingly went back to colonel wyndhams with intelligence of the plan that he had formed while the captain of the vessel went to work as privately as possible to lay in his stores and make his other preparations for sea he did this with the utmost precaution and secrecy and succeeded in deceiving every body but his wife wives have the opportunity to perceive indications of the concealed existence of matters of moment and weight which others do not enjoy in studying the countenances of their husbands a man can easily through the day when surrounded by the world assume an unconcerned and careless air though oppressed with a very considerable mental burden but when he comes home at night he instinctively throws off half his disguise and conjugal watchfulness and solicitude easily penetrate the remainder at least it was so in this case the captains dame perceived that her husband was thoughtful and absent minded she watched him she observed some indications that he was making preparations for sea she asked him what it meant he said he did not know how soon he might have a cargo and he wanted to be all ready in season his wife however was not satisfied she watched him more closely still and when the appointed night came on which he had agreed to sail finding that it was impossible for him to elude her vigilance he told her plainly that he was going across the channel on private business but that he should immediately return  she declared positively that he should not go she knew she said that the business was something which would end in ruining him and his family and she was determined that he should not risk her safety and his own life in any such desperate and treasonable plans she locked the door upon him and when he insisted on being released she declared that if he did attempt to go she would immediately give warning to the authorities and have him arrested and confined so the discomfited captain was compelled to give up his design and break his appointment at the charmouth pier  in the mean time the king and lord wilmot came down as had been agreed upon to charmouth and put up with many other travelers at the inn there was great excitement all over that part of the country every one talking about the battle of worcester the escape of the king and especially about an expedition which cromwell had been organizing which was then assembling on the southern coast its destination was the island of jersey which had thus far adhered to the royalist cause and which cromwell was now intending to reduce to subjection to him the bustle and movement which all these causes combined to create made the king and lord wilmot very anxious and uneasy there were assemblies convened in the villages which they passed through and men were haranguing the populace on the victories which had been gained and on the future measures to be pursued in one place the bells were ringing and bonfires were burning in celebration of the death of the king it being rumored and believed that he had been shot  our two fugitives however arrived safely at the inn put up their horses and began to watch anxiously for the light of the approaching vessel they watched of course in vain midnight came but no vessel they waited hour after hour till at last morning dawned and they found that all hope of accomplishing their enterprise must be abandoned they could not remain where they were however another day without suspicion so they prepared to move on and seek temporary refuge in some other neighboring town while they could send one of the attendants who came with them back to colonel wyndhams to see if he could ascertain the cause of the failure one or two days were spent in inquiries negotiations and delays the result was that all hope of embarking at lyme had to be abandoned and it was concluded that the fugitives should proceed on to the eastward along the coast to the care of another royalist a certain colonel gunter who might perhaps find means to send them away from some port in that part of the country at any rate they would by this plan escape the excitements and dangers which seemed to environ them in the neighborhood of lyme  it was fortunate that they went away from charmouth when they did by doing so they narrowly escaped apprehension for that night while the kings horse was in the stable a smith was sent for to set a shoe upon the horse of one of the other travelers after finishing his work he began to examine the feet of the other horses in the stalls and when he came to the one which the king had rode his attention was particularly attracted to the condition and appearance of the shoes and he remarked to those who were with him that that horse had come a long journey and that of the four shoes he would warrant that no two had been made in the same county this remark was quoted the next day and the mysterious circumstance trifling as it was was sufficient in the highly excitable state of the public mind to awaken attention people came to see the horse and to inquire for the owner but they found that both had disappeared they immediately determined that the stranger must have been the king or at least some distinguished personage in disguise and they sent in search of the party in every direction but the travelers had taken such effectual precautions to blind all pursuit that their track could not be followed  in the mean time the king journeyed secretly on from the residence of one faithful adherent to another encountering many perplexities and escaping narrowly many dangers until he came at last to the neighborhood of shoreham a town upon the coast of sussex colonel gunter had provided a vessel here it was a small vessel bound with a load of coal along the coast to the westward to a port called pool beyond the isle of wight colonel gunter had arranged it with the master to deviate from his voyage by crossing over to the coast of france and leaving his passengers there he was then to return and proceed to his original destination both the owner of the vessel and the master who commanded it were royalists but they had not been told that it was the king whom they were going to convey in the bargain which had been made with them the passengers had been designated simply as two gentlemen of rank who had escaped from the battle of worcester when however the master of the vessel saw the king he immediately recognized him having seen him before in his campaigns under his father this however seemed to make no difference in his readiness to convey the passengers away he said that hews perfectly willing to risk his life to save that of his sovereign and the arrangements for the embarkation proceeded  the little vesselits burden was about sixty tonswas brought into a small cove at brighthelmstone a few miles to the eastward from shoreham and run upon the beach where it was left stranded when the tide went down the king and lord wilmot went to it by night ascended its side by a ladder went down immediately into the cabin and concealed themselves there when the rising tide had lifted the vessel with its precious burden gently from the sand the master made easy sail and coasted along the english shore toward the isle of wight which was the direction of the voyage which he had originally intended to make he did not wish the people at shoreham to observe any alteration of his course since that might have awakened suspicion and possibly invited pursuit so they went on for a time to the westward which was a course that rather increased than diminished their distance from their place of destination  it was seven oclock in the morning when they sailed there was a gentle october breeze from the north which carried them slowly along the shore and in the afternoon the isle of wight came fully into view there were four men and a boy on board the ship constituting the crew the master came to the king in the cabin and proposed to him as a measure of additional security and to prevent the possibility of any opposition on the part of the sailors to the proposed change in their course which it would now soon be necessary to make that the king and lord wilmot should propose the plan of going to france to them asking their interest with the captain in obtaining his consent as it had not yet been mentioned to the captain at all for the sailors had of course understood that the voyage was only the usual coastwise trip to the port of pool and that these strangers were ordinary travelers going on that voyage the master therefore thought that there would be less danger of difficulty if the king were first to gain the sailors over himself by promises or rewards and then all come together to gain the captains consent which could then at last with apparent reluctance be accorded  this plan was pursued the two travelers went to the sailors upon the forecastle and told them with an air of honest confidence that they were not what they seemed they were merchants they said and were unfortunately a little in debt and under the necessity of leaving england for a time they had some money due to them in rouen in france and they wanted very much to be taken across the channel to dieppe or some port near rouen they made known their condition to the sailors they said because they wanted their intercession with the captain to take them over and they gave the sailors a good generous present in money for them to spend in drink not so generous however as to cast suspicion upon their story of being traders in distress  sailors are easily persuaded by arguments that are enforced by small presents of money they consented to the plan and then the king and lord wilmot went to express their wishes to the captain he made many objections it would delay him on his voyage and lead to many inconveniences the passengers however urged their request the sailors seconding them the wind was fair and they could easily run across the channel and then after they landed the captain could pursue his course to the place of his destination the captain finally consented the helm was altered the sails were trimmed and the little vessel bore away toward its new destination on the coast of france  it was now five oclock in the afternoon the english coast soon disappeared from the horizon and the next morning at daylight they could see the french shore they approached the land at a little port called fecamp the wind however failed them before they got quite to the land and they had to anchor to wait for a turn of the tide to help them in in this situation they were soon very much alarmed by the appearance of a vessel in the offing which was coming also toward the shore they thought it was a spanish privateer and its appearance brought a double apprehension there was danger that the privateer would capture them france and spain being then at war there was danger also that the master of their vessel afraid himself of being captured might insist on making all haste back again to the english coast for the wind though contrary so long as they wished to go on into their harbor was fair for taking them away the king and lord wilmot consulted together and came to the conclusion to go ashore in the little boat they soon made a bargain with the sailors to row them and hastily descending the vessels side they entered the boat and pushed off over the rolling surges of the channel  they were two miles from the shore but they reached it in safety the sailors went back to the vessel the privateer turned out to be a harmless trader coming into port the english vessel recrossed the channel and went on to its original port of destination and lord wilmot and the king relieved now of all their anxieties and fears walked in their strange english dress up into the village to the inn     chapter ix  the restoration    as the readers of a tale are generally inclined to sympathize with the hero of it both in his joys and in his sorrows whether he is deserving of sympathy or not they who follow the adventures of charles in his wanderings in england after the unfortunate battle of worcester feel ordinarily quite a strong sensation of pleasure at finding him at last safely landed on the french shore charles himself doubtless experienced at first an overwhelming emotion of exultation and joy at having thus saved himself from the desperate dangers of his condition in england on cool reflection however he soon perceived that there was but little cause for rejoicing in his condition and prospects there were dangers and sufferings enough still before him different it is true from those in which he had been involved but still very dark and threatening in character he had now in fact ten years of privation poverty and exile before him full of troubles from beginning to end  the new series of troubles began to come upon him too very soon when he and his companion went up to the inn on the morning of their landing dressed as they were in the guise of englishmen of humble rank and having been put ashore too from a vessel which immediately afterward sailed away they were taken for english thieves or fugitives from justice and refused admission to the inn they sent to some gentlemen of the neighborhood to whom they made themselves known so that this difficulty was removed their urgent wants were supplied and they were provided with the means of transportation to paris of course the mother of the fugitive monarch yet almost a boy was rejoiced to welcome him but he received no very cordial welcome from any one else now that charles had finally abandoned england his adherents there gave up his cause of course as totally lost the republicans with cromwell at their head established a very firm and efficient government which the nations of the continent soon began to find that it would be incumbent on them to respect for any foreign court to harbor a pretender to the british crown when there was an established government in england based on a determination of the people to abrogate royalty altogether was to incur very considerable political danger charles soon found that under these circumstances he was not likely to be long a very welcome guest in the french palaces  he remained however in paris for a short time endeavoring to find some way to retrieve his ruined fortunes anne maria was still there and he attempted to renew his suit to her she listened to the entertaining stories which he told of his dangers and escapes in england and for a time as charles thought encouraged his attentions in fact at one time he really believed that the affair was all settled and began to assume that it was so in speaking with her upon the subject she however at length undeceived him in a conversation which ended with her saying that she thought he had better go back to england and either get his head broken or else have a crown upon it the fact was that anne maria was now full of a new scheme for being married to louis xiv himself who though much younger than she had attained now to a marriageable age and she had no intention of regarding charles in any other light than as one of the ordinary crowd of her admirers she finally extinguished all his hopes by coolly requesting him not to visit her so frequently  in addition to his other sources of discomfort charles disagreed with his mother she was a very decided catholic and he a protestant from policy it is true and not principle but he was none the less rigid and inflexible on that account he and his mother disagreed in respect to the education of the younger children they were both restricted in their means too and subject to a thousand mortifications from this cause in the proud and haughty circle in which they moved finally the king decided to leave paris altogether and try to find a more comfortable refuge in holland  his sister and her husband the prince of orange had always treated him as well as all the rest of the family with great kindness and attention but now to complete the catalogue of his disasters the prince of orange died the power of the government passed into other hands and mary found herself deprived of influence and honor and reduced all at once to a private station she would have been glad to continue her protection to her brother but the new government feared the power of cromwell cromwell sent word to them that england would consider their harboring of the fugitive as tantamount to a declaration of war so they notified charles that he must leave their dominions and find if he could some other place of retreat he went up the rhine to the city of cologne where it is said he found a widow woman who received him as a lodger without pay trusting to his promise to recompense her at some future time there is generally little risk in giving credit to european monarchs expelled by the temporary triumph of republicanism from their native realms they are generally pretty certain of being sooner or later restored to their thrones  at any rate charles was restored and his restoration was effected in a manner wholly unexpected to all mankind in order that the circumstances may be clearly understood the reader must recall it to mind that charles the first had been deposed and beheaded by the action of a parliament and that this parliament was of course at his death the depository of sovereign power in england in a short time however the army with cromwell at its head became too strong for the parliament cromwell assumed the supreme power under the name of the protector he dissolved parliament and expelled the members from their seats he governed the country as protector for many years and when at length he died his son richard cromwell attempted to take his place richard did not however possess the talent and energy of his father and he soon found himself totally inadequate to manage the affairs of government in such stormy times he was deposed and the old parliament which cromwell had broken up was restored  there followed then a new contest between the parliament and the army with an officer named lambert at the head of the latter the army proved the strongest lambert stationed guards in the streets leading to the parliament house one day when the members were about to assemble and turned the members all back as they came when the speaker arrived in his carriage he ordered his soldiers to take hold of the horses heads and turn them round and lead them home again thus there was no actual outward violence but the members of parliament were intimidated and gave up the attempt to exercise their power though they still reserved their claim and their party was busy all over the kingdom in attempting to restore them to their functions in the mean time the army appointed a sort of council which they invested with supreme authority  it does not come within the scope and design of this volume to give a full account of the state of public affairs during the interregnum between the death of charles i and the restoration of the monarchy under charles ii nor of the points of controversy at issue among the various parties formed the reader however must not suppose that during this period there was at any time what could with any propriety be called a republic a true republic exists only where the questions of government are fairly and honorably submitted to the whole population with a universal disposition to acquiesce peaceably in the decision of the majority when that is ascertained there probably has never been any such state of things as this in any country of europe since the christian era there certainly was no such state of things in england in the time of the commonwealth there were a great many persons who wished to have it so and who called themselves republicans but their plan if that were indeed their plan was never tried very likely it was not practicable to try it at any rate it certainly was not tried the sovereignty taken from the stuart dynasty in the person of charles i was never vested in the people at large it was seized forcibly by the various powers already existing in the state as they found themselves one after another able to seize it the parliament took it from charles the army took it from parliament then oliver cromwell took it from the army he found himself strong enough to hold it as long as he lived and when he died he delivered it to his son richard richard could not hold it the parliament rose to a sort of supplementary existence and took it from richard and then the army took it from parliament again finally general monk appeared upon the stage in scotland as we shall presently see marched down through england and with the help of thousands and thousands who were tired of these endless changes took it from the army and restored it once more to the parliament on condition of their placing it back again in the hands of the king thus there was no republic at all from beginning to end  nor is it at all certain that there ought to have been the difficulties of really truly and honestly laying the national sovereignty in the hands of the whole population of such a realm as england and of so organizing the population that its decisions shall actually control the legislation of the country and the public administration of its affairs are all but insuperable the english people found the tyranny and oppression of royalty intolerable they arose and set royalty aside it devolved then on the next strongest power in the state to assume the authority thus divested this was the parliament who governed just as the king had done by the exercise of their own superior power keeping the mass of the community just where they were before it is true that many individuals of very low rank rose to positions of great power but they represented only a party and the power they wielded was monarchical power usurped not republican power fairly conferred upon them thus though in the time of the commonwealth there were plenty of republicans there was never a republic it has always been so in all european revolutions in america legislatures and executive officers of state are only agents through whom the great population itself quietly executes its will the two millions of votes in the great elections being the real power by which every thing is controlled but cromwell napoleon lamartine cavaignac and all the others whatever formalities of voting may have attended their induction into office have always really held their power by force of bayonets not of ballots there is great danger that it will continue so in europe for a long time to come  but to return it was in 1659 when the army with lambert at its head expelled the parliament all england was now divided into parties some for the parliament some for the army some for the king there was a distinguished general in scotland at this time named monk he had been left there by cromwell in command of the military forces in that country he was a man considerably advanced in life and of great circumspection prudence and steadiness of character all parties wished to gain his influence but he kept his own counsel and declared openly for neither  he however began to get together his forces and to make preparations to march into england people asked him what he intended to do but he would give no definite answer he was six weeks getting ready for his expedition during which time many deputations were sent to him from the various parties making different propositions to him each party being eager to obtain his adhesion to their cause he received all their deputations heard what they had to say made no definite reply to any of them but went on quietly with his work he got the various divisions of his army at length together made provisional arrangements for the government of scotland during his absence and set out on his march  he entered england in january 1660 and advanced toward london the english army was scattered all over the kingdom but monk opened negotiations with the leaders of it and also with the members of parliament and without committing himself absolutely to either party he managed to have the parliament restored they assembled peaceably in london and resumed their functions a part of the english army was there for their protection monk as he approached london sent word to parliament asking that quarters might be provided for him and his army there parliament desirous of conciliating him and securing his cooperation in sustaining their power acceded to this request the other troops were removed monk entered london in triumph and took possession of all the strong holds there holding them nominally under parliamentary authority monk still kept his ultimate designs profoundly secret no party very strongly opposed him for no party knew whether to regard him as an enemy or a friend the royalists however all over the kingdom took new courage and a general expectation began to pervade the minds of men that the monarchy was to be restored the parliament rescinded the votes which had been most decisive against the house of stuart and monarchical rule the most prominent republicans were dismissed from office under various pretexts and men known to be loyal were appointed in their place finally the parliament itself was dissolved and writs were issued for the election of a new one more in accordance with the ancient forms  when at length this new parliament assembled the public mind was in a great fever of excitement there being a vague expectation every where that the monarchy was to be restored while yet the restoration was openly spoken of by no one the first votes which were taken in the house of commons indicated a very favorable state of feeling toward monarchy and at length a few days after the opening of the session it was announced that there was a messenger at the door with a communication from the king the announcement was received with the wildest acclamations of joy the messenger was immediately ordered to enter the communication was read the vast assembly listening with breathless attention  it contained in the first place a letter in which the king stated that having heard that the people of england had restored the parliament according to the ancient forms he hoped that now the parliament would go on and complete the good work which had been begun and heal the distractions of the kingdom by reinstating him as sovereign in the ancient rights and prerogatives of the crown  the second part of the kings communication and by far the most important part was what was called his declaration a document in which he announced formally what his intentions were in case he were restored to the throne one of these assurances was that he was ready to forgive and forget the past so far as he might himself be supposed to have cause of complaint against any of his subjects for the part they had taken in the late transactions he professed his readiness to grant a free pardon to all excepting those who should be expressly excluded from such pardon by the parliament itself the declaration also set forth that inasmuch as there was prevailing throughout the country a great diversity of religious opinion the king if restored to his throne whatever his own religious views or those of his government might be would agree that his subjects should be allowed full liberty of conscience in all respects and that nobody should be molested in any way on account of his religious faith or usages of worship  and finally the declaration contained a covenant on the part of the king that whereas there had been great changes of property arising from fines and confiscations for political offenses during the period of the revolution he would not himself disturb the existing titles to property but would leave them to be settled on such principles and in such a way as parliament should direct  the letter from the king and especially the declaration gave the utmost satisfaction the latter disarmed those who would otherwise have opposed the return of the king by quieting their fears of being disturbed in respect to their liberty or their property immediately after these papers were read they were ordered to be published and were sent every where throughout the kingdom awakening wherever they went the greatest demonstrations of joy the parliament passed a vote that the ancient constitution of the kingdom of government by king lords and commons ought to be restored and they went forth in a body into the public places of the city to proclaim charles ii king  parliament voted immediately a grant of fifty thousand pounds a sum equal to more than two hundred thousand dollars for the kings immediate use with large sums besides for the other members of the family and sent a committee of noblemen to holland to carry the money and to invite the king back to his dominions as soon as tidings of these events reached the continent every body hastened to pay their court to his majesty from being neglected destitute and wretched he suddenly found himself elevated to the highest pinnacle of prosperity and fame every body offered him their aid his court was thronged and all were ready to do him honor the princely mother of one of the young ladies who had rejected the offer of his hand in the day of his adversity sent him an intimation that the offer would be accepted if he would renew it now  a fleet crossed the channel to receive the king and convey him to london his brother james the duke of york was placed in command of it as lord high admiral of england the fleet sailed for dover general monk went to dover to receive the king at his landing he escorted him to london where the monarch returning from his long exile arrived on the twentyninth of may the very day when he became thirty years of age  general monk whose talent skill and consummate management had been the means of effecting this great change without violence or bloodshed was rewarded by being made duke of albermarle this was a very great reward in fact no american imagination can conceive of the images of glory and grandeur which are connected in the mind of an englishman with the idea of being made a duke a duke lives in a palace he is surrounded by a court he expends princely revenues he reigns in fact often so far as the pomp and pleasure of reigning are concerned over quite a little kingdom and is looked up to by the millions beneath his grade with a reverence as great at least as that with which the ancients looked up to their gods he is deprived of nothing which pertains to power but the mere toil and care and responsibility of ruling so that he has all the sweetness and fragrance of sovereignty without its thorns in a word the seat of an english duke so far as earthly greatness and glory are concerned is undoubtedly the finest which ambition wealth and power combined have ever succeeded in carving out for man it is infinitely better than a throne  some historians maintain that monk acted on a secret understanding with charles from the commencement that the general was to restore the king and was then to receive a dukedom for his reward others say that he acted from a simple sense of duty in all that he did and that the lofty elevation to which he was raised was a very natural and suitable testimonial of the royal gratitude the reader will embrace the one or the other of the two theories according to the degree of readiness or of reluctance with which he believes in the existence of conscientious principles of patriotism and loyalty among the great men who rule the world     chapter x  the marriage    during the period of king charless days of adversity he made many fruitless attempts to obtain a wife he was rejected by all the young ladies to whom he made proposals marriages in that grade of society are almost always mere transactions of business being governed altogether by political and prudential considerations in all charless proposals he was aiming simply at strengthening his own position by means of the wealth or family influence of the bride supposing as he did that the honor of being even nominally a queen would be a sufficient equivalent to the lady the ladies themselves however to whom he addressed himself or their friends thought that the prospect of his being really restored to his throne was very remote and uncertain and in the mean time the empty name of queen was not worth as much as a rich and powerful heiress by becoming his bride would have to pay for it  after his restoration however all this was changed there was no longer any difficulty he had now only to choose in fact one or two who had refused him when he was a fugitive and an exile thought differently of the case now that he was a king and one of them as has already been said gave him intimations through her friends that if he were inclined to renew his suit he would be more successful charles rejected these overtures with indignant disdain  the lady whom he ultimately married was a portuguese princess her father was king of portugal but before his accession to the throne his title had been the duke of braganza the name of his daughter was catharine she is thus known generally in history by the name of catharine of braganza  it is said that the plan of this marriage originated with queen henrietta maria and that a prominent motive with her in promoting the measure was her desire to secure for charles a catholic wife catharine of braganza was a catholic henrietta maria was deeply interested and no doubt conscientiously so in bringing back her own family and their descendants and the realm of england if possible to the ancient faith and this question of the marriage of her son she justly considered would have a very important bearing on the result  queen henrietta is said to have laid her arrangements in train for opening the negotiation with the portuguese princess at a visit which she made to england in 1660 very soon after her sons restoration the restoration took place in may the queens visit to her son was in october of course after all the long years of danger privation and suffering which this family had endured the widowed mother felt an intense emotion of joy at finding her children once more restored to what she considered their just hereditary rights charles was on the english throne james the duke of york was lord high admiral of england that is the commanderinchief of the naval forces of the realm and her other children those who were still living were in peace and safety of course her heart was full of maternal pride and joy  her son james the lord high admiral went across the channel to dover with a fleet of the finest ships that he could select from the whole british navy to escort his mother to england the queen was to embark at calais footnote for a view of the famous calais pier see history of mary queen of scots page 105 the queen came down to the port from paris attended by many friends who sympathized with her in the return of her prosperity and were attracted besides by the grand spectacle which they thought would be presented by the appearance and maneuvers of the english ships and the ceremony of the embarkation  the waters of the english channel are disturbed by almost perpetual agitations which bleak winds and rapid tides struggling continually together combine to raise and many a traveler who passes in comfort across the atlantic is made miserable by the incessant restlessness of this narrow sea at the time however when henrietta maria crossed it the waters for once were calm the people who assembled upon the pier to witness the embarkation looked over the expanse before them and saw it lying smooth every where as glass and reflecting the great english ships which lay at a little distance from the shore as if it were a mirror it was a bright and beautiful october morning the air seemed perfectly motionless the english ships were adorned with countless flags in honor of the occasion but they all hung down perfectly lifeless upon the masts and rigging scarcely a ripple rolled upon the beach and so silent and still was the morning air that the voices and echoes came from vast distances along the shore and the dip of the oars of the boats gliding about in the offing sent its sound for miles around over the smooth surface of the sea and when the grand salute was fired at the embarkation of the queen the reverberation of the guns was heard distinctly it was said at dover a distance of thirty miles  even in such a calm as this however uncommon as it is the atmosphere is not perfectly still when the royal party were on board the vessels and the sails were set the fleet did begin to glide almost imperceptibly it is true away from the shore in the course of the day they had receded several miles from the land and when the dinner hour arrived they found that the lord admiral had provided a most sumptuous banquet on board just before the time however for setting down to the table the duke found that it was a catholic fast day and that neither his mother nor any of her attendants being as they were all catholics could eat any thing but fish and unfortunately as all jamess men were protestants they had not thought of the fast and they had no fish on board they however contrived to produce a sturgeon for the queen and they sat down to the table the queen to the dish provided for her and the others to bread and vegetables and such other food as the catholic ritual allowed while the duke himself and his brother officers disposed as well as they could of the more luxurious dainties which they had intended for their guests  with a fair wind three hours is sufficient for the run from calais to dover it took the duke of york two days to get his fleet across in this calm at length however they arrived the king was on the pier to receive his mother rejoiced as her majesty must have been to be welcomed by her son under such circumstances she must have thought mournfully of her departed husband at the time of her landing for it was here that he had taken leave of her some years before when the troubles of her family were beginning charles conducted his mother to the castle all the inhabitants of dover and of the country around had assembled to witness the arrival and they welcomed the mother back to the land of her husband and her sons with long and loud acclamations  there was a great banquet at dover castle here all the members of the royal family were present having been assembled for the occasion of course it was an occasion of great family rejoicing mingled undoubtedly on the part of the queen with many mournful thoughts and bitter recollections the fast was past and there was consequently no difficulty now about partaking of the food that had been provided but another difficulty arose having the same origin viz the question whether the divine blessing should be implored upon the food by a catholic priest or an episcopal chaplain neither party could conscientiously acquiesce in the performance of the service by the other they settled the important question or rather it settled itself at last in the following manner when the guests were ready to take their places at table the king instead of asking his mothers spiritual guide to officiate as both christian and filial courtesy required him to have done called upon his own chaplain the chaplain said grace immediately afterward the catholic priest thinking that fidelity to his own religious faith required him to act decidedly repeated the service in the catholic form ending with making the sign of the cross in a very conspicuous manner over the table the gentry of dover who had been admitted as spectators of this banquet were greatly scandalized at this deed they regarded the gesture as an act of very wicked and vary dangerous idolatry  from dover the queen proceeded with her children to london her sons did every thing in their power to honor their mothers visit they received her with great parade and pomp assigned her a sumptuous residence and studied every means of amusing her and of making her visit a source of pleasure but they did not succeed the queen was very unhappy every place that she visited recalled to her mind the memory of her husband and awakened afresh all her sorrows she was distressed too by some domestic troubles which we have not here time to describe then the religious differences between herself and her children and the questions which were arising out of them continually gave her a great deal of pain she could not but perceive moreover that she was regarded with suspicion and dislike by the people of england on account of her catholic faith then besides notwithstanding her english husband and her english children she was herself a french woman still in character thought feeling and language and she could not feel really at home north of the channel after remaining therefore a few months in london and arranging some family and business affairs which required her attention she determined to return the king accompanied her to portsmouth where she set sail taking the little princess henrietta with her and went back to france among the family affairs however which she arranged it is said that the marriage of her son the king was a special object of her attention and that she secretly laid the train which resulted in his espousing catharine of braganza  according to the accounts given in the chronicles of the times the negotiations were opened in the following manner one day the portuguese ambassador at london came to a certain high officer of the kings household and introduced the subject of his majestys marriage saying in the course of the conversation that he thought the princess catharine of portugal would be a very eligible match and adding moreover that he was authorized to say that with the lady very advantageous terms could be offered charles said he would think of it this gave the ambassador sufficient encouragement to induce him to take another step he obtained an audience of charles the next day and proposed the subject directly for his consideration the ambassador knew very well that the question would turn in charless mind on the pecuniary and political advantages of the match so he stated at once what they would be he was authorized to offer he said the sum of five hundred thousand pounds footnote equal to two or three millions of dollars as the princesss portion and to surrender to the english crown various foreign possessions which had till then belonged to the portuguese one of the principal of these was the island of bombay in the east indies another was tangier a port in africa the english did not at that time hold any east indian territories he likewise offered to convey to the english nation the right of trading with the great south american country of brazil which then pertained to the portuguese crown  charles was very much pleased with these proposals he immediately consulted his principal minister of state lord clarendon the celebrated historian and soon afterward called a meeting of his privy council and laid the case before them clarendon asked him if he had given up all thoughts of a protestant connection charles said that he did not know where to look for a protestant wife it was true in fact that nearly all the royal families of europe were catholics and royal bridegrooms must always have royal brides there were however protestant princesses in germany this was suggested to his majesty but he replied with an expression of contempt that they were all dull and foggy and he could not possibly have one of them for a wife  the counselors then began to look at the pecuniary and political advantages of the proposed bargain they got out their maps and showed charles where bombay and tangier and the other places offered with the lady as her dowry lay the statesmen were quite pleased with the prospect of these acquisitions and charles was particularly gratified with the money item it was twice as much they said as any english king had ever before received as the marriage portion of a bride in a word the proposition was unanimously considered as in every respect entirely satisfactory and charles authorized his ministers to open the negotiations for the marriage immediately all this time charles had never seen the lady and perhaps had never heard of her before her own individual qualifications whether of mind or of person seem to have been considered a subject not worth inquiring about at all  nor ought we to be at all surprised at this it was not charless object in seeking a wife to find some one whom he was to cherish and love and who was to promote his happiness by making him the object of her affection in return his love so far as such a soul is capable of love was to be gratified by other means he had always some female favorite chosen from among the ladies of his court high in rank though not high enough to be the wedded wife of the king these attachments were not private in any sense nor was any attempt made to conceal them the king being in the habit of bestowing upon the objects of them all the public attentions as well as the private intimacy which pertain to wedded life the kings favorite at the present time was lady castlemaine she was originally a mrs palmer but the king had made her husband lord castlemaine for the purpose of giving a title to the wife some years afterward he made her a duchess she was a prominent lady in the court being every where received and honored as the temporary wife of the king he did not intend in marrying the princess catharine to disturb this state of things at all she was to be in name his wife but he was to place his affections where he pleased she was to have her own palace her own household and her own pleasures and he on the other hand was to continue to have his  notwithstanding this however charles seemed to have had some consideration for the personal appearance of his proposed bride after all the spanish government as soon as charless plan of espousing catharine became known attempted to prevent the match as it would greatly increase the strength and influence of portugal by giving to that country so powerful an ally spain had plenty of money but no princess in the royal family and the government therefore proposed to charles that if he would be content to take some protestant lady for a wife they would endow her and with a portion as great as that which had been offered with catharine they moreover represented to charles that catharine was out of health and very plain and repulsive in her personal appearance and that besides it would be a great deal better for him for obvious political reasons to marry a protestant princess the other party replied that catharine was not ugly by any means and they showed charles her portrait which after looking at it a few minutes he said was not unhandsome they reminded him also that catharine was only the third in succession from the crown of portugal so that the chance of her actually inheriting that realm was not at all to be disregarded charles thought this a very important consideration and on the whole decided that the affair should go on and commissioners were sent to make a formal proposal of marriage at the portuguese court charles wrote letters to the mother of the young lady and to the young lady herself expressing the personal interest he felt in obtaining the princesss hand  the negotiations thus commenced went on for many months with no other obstruction than the complication and intricacy which attend all matrimonial arrangements where the interests of kingdoms as well as the personal happiness of the wedded pair are involved in the issue ambassadors were sent and contracts and treaties were drawn up discussed modified and finally signed a formal announcement of the proposed marriage was made to the english parliament and addresses congratulatory were voted and presented in reply arrangements were made for transferring the foreign possessions promised to the british crown and lastly the money intended for the dower was collected tied up in bags sealed and deposited safely in the strong room of the castle at lisbon in fact every thing went on prosperously to the end and when all was thus finally settled charles wrote the following letter to his expected bride  london 2d of july 1661 my lady and wife  already the ambassador has set off for lisbon for me the signing of the marriage has been great happiness and there is about to be dispatched at this time after him one of my servants charged with what would appear necessary whereby may be declared on my part the inexpressible joy of this felicitous conclusion which when received will hasten the coming of your majesty  i am going to make a short progress into some of my provinces in the mean time while i am going further from my most sovereign good yet i do not complain as to whither i go seeking in vain tranquility in my restlessness looking to see the beloved person of your majesty in these realms already your own and that with the same anxiety with which after my long banishment i desired to see myself within them and my subjects desiring also to behold me among them the presence of your serenity is only wanting to unite us under the protection of god in the health and content i desire  the very faithful husband of her majesty whose hand he kisses                         charles rex  the letter was addressed  to the queen of great britain my wife and lady whom god preserve  whoever reads this letter attentively will see in it that infallible criterion of hypocrisy and pretense in professions of regard viz extravagant ideas feebly and incoherently expressed when the heart dictates what is said the thoughts are natural and the language plain but in composition like the above we see a continual striving to say something for effect which the writer invents by his ingenuity as he goes on without any honest impulses from the heart to guide him he soars one minute and breaks down the next in absurd alternations of the sublime and the ridiculous how honest charles was in such professions and what was the kind of connubial happiness which he was preparing for his bride is shown by the fact that he was even now spending all his time with lady castlemaine and to reconcile her to his marriage with catharine he had promised her that he would make her one of the ladies of the queens bed chamber as soon as she arrived in london which would give him constant opportunities of being in her society  we have made very little allusion to catharine herself thus far in the account of these transactions because she has had thus far nothing to do with them every thing has been arranged for her by her mother who was an ambitious and masculine woman and at this time the queen regent of portugal catharine had been kept shut up all her days in the most strict seclusion and in the most rigorous subjection to her mothers will it is said that she had hardly been ten times out of the palace in her life since her return to it from the convent where she had been educated the innocent and simple hearted maiden looked forward to her marriage as to a release from a tedious and intolerable bondage they had shown her king charless picture and had given her an account of his perilous adventures and romantic escapes and of the courage and energy which he had sometimes displayed and that was all she knew she had her childlike ideas of love and of conjugal fidelity and happiness and believed that she was going to realize them as she looked forward therefore to the period of her departure for england she longed impatiently for the time to come her heart bounding at every thought of the happy hour with eager anticipations of delight  an english noblemanthe earl of sandwichwas sent with a squadron to bring the bride to england he was received when he entered the tagus with great ceremony a portuguese minister went down the river to meet him in a magnificent barge the nobleman descended to the lowest step of the ladder which led down the side of the ship to receive the minister they ascended the ladder together while the ship fired a salute of twenty or thirty guns they went into the cabin and took seats there with great ceremony the minister then rose and made an address of welcome to the english commander lord sandwich replied and there was then another thundering salute of cannon  all this parade and ceremony was in this case as it often is not an expression of real cordiality good will and good faith but a substitute for them the english commander who had been specially instructed to bring over the money as well as the bride found to his great astonishment and perplexity that the queen regent had spent a considerable portion of the money which had been put away so safely in the bags and she wished to pay now a part of the dowry in merchandise at such prices as she thought reasonable and to have a years credit for the remainder there was thus thrown upon lord sandwich the very heavy responsibility of deciding whether to give up the object of his expedition and go back to england without the bride or to take her without the money after very anxious hesitation and suspense he decided to proceed with his enterprise and the preparations were made for the princesss embarkation  when the day arrived the queen descended the grand staircase of the palace and at the foot of it took leave of her mother neither mother nor daughter shed a tear the princess was conducted through the streets accompanied by a long cavalcade and a procession of splendid carriages through long lines of soldiers and under triumphal arches and over paths strewed with flowers while bands of music and groups of dancers at various distances along the way expressed the general congratulation and joy when they reached the pier there was a splendid brigantine or barge ready to receive the bride and her attendants the earl of sandwich and other english officers of high rank belonging to the squadron entered the barge too the water was covered with boats and the shipping in the river was crowded with spectators the barge moved on to the ship which was to convey the bridal party who ascended to the deck by means of a spacious and beautiful stair constructed upon its side salutes were fired by the english ships and were echoed by the portuguese forts on the shore the princesss brother and the ladies who had accompanied her on board to take leave of her there now bade her farewell and returned by the barge to the shore while the ships weighed anchor and prepared to put to sea  the wind was however contrary and they were compelled to remain that night in the river and as soon as the darkness came on the whole shore became resplendent with illuminations at the windows in the city and with rockets and fire balls and fireworks of every kind rising from boats upon the water and from the banks and heights and castle battlements all around upon the land this gay and splendid spectacle beguiled the night but the wind continued unfavorable all the next day and confined the squadron still to the river catharines mother sent out a messenger during the day to inquire after her daughters health and welfare the etiquette of royalty did not allow of her coming to see her child  the fleet which consisted of fourteen menofwar put to sea on the second day after a long and stormy passage the squadron arrived off the isle of wight the duke of york came out to meet it there with five other ships and they all entered the harbor of portsmouth together as soon as catharine landed she wrote immediately to charles to notify him of her arrival the news produced universal excitement in london the bells were rung bonfires were made in the streets and houses were illuminated every body seemed full of joy and pleasure except the king himself he seemed to care little about it he was supping that night with lady castlemaine it was five days before he set out to meet his bride and he supped with lady castlemaine the night before he commenced his journey  some of charless best friends were very much grieved at his pursuing such a course others were very indignant but the majority of the people around him at court were like himself in character and manners and were only led to more open irregularity and vice themselves by this public example of their sovereign in the mean time the king moved on to portsmouth escorted by a body of his life guards he found that his intended bride was confined to her bed with a sort of slow fever it was the result they said of the roughness and discomforts of the voyage though we may certainly imagine another cause charles went immediately to the house where she was residing and was admitted to visit her in her chamber the many attendants who were present at the interview watching with great interest every word and look on either side by which they might judge of the nature of the first impression made by the bride and bridegroom upon each other catharine was not considered beautiful and it was natural that a degree of curiosity should be manifested to learn how charles would regard her  there are two apparently contradictory accounts of the impression made upon charles by this his first sight of his intended bride charles wrote a letter to lord clarendon in which he expressed himself very well satisfied with her he admitted that she was no beauty but her countenance was agreeable he said and her conversation he added as far as i can perceive is very good for she has wit enough and a very agreeable voice you would be surprised to see how well we are acquainted already in a word i think myself very happy and i am confident that we shall agree very well together i have not time to say any more my lord lieutenant will tell you the rest at the same time while writing this in his official communication to his minister he said privately to one of his companions on leaving the presence of his bride that upon his word they had sent him a bat instead of a woman  the royal couple were married the next day first very privately in the catholic form and afterward more openly in a great hall and before a large assembly according to the ritual of the church of england the bride was attired in the english style her dress being of rose color trimmed with knots of blue ribbon these knots were after the ceremony detached from the dress and distributed among the company as wedding favors every lady eagerly pressing forward to get a share magnificent presents were made to the groomsmen and bridesmaids and the company dispersed the queen still indisposed went back to her bed and her supper was served to her there the king and other members of the household partaking it with her seated at the bedside  a day or two afterward the royal party proceeded to london in a long train composed of life guards carriages horsemen baggage wagons and attendants of every grade the queens heart was full of anticipations of happiness the others who knew what state of things she was to find on her arrival there looked forward to scenes of trouble and woe     chapter xi  character and reign    some of the traits of character for which king charles ii has been most noted among mankind are well illustrated by his management of the affair of lady castlemaine when the queen arrived at her new home in hampton court hampton court is a very spacious and beautiful palace on the banks of the thames some miles above london splendidly built and very pleasantly situated at a graceful bend of the river it was magnificently fitted up and furnished for catharines reception her suite of apartments were supplied and adorned in the most sumptuous manner her bed which was a present to charles at the time of his restoration from the states of holland was said to have cost with all the appurtenances a sum equal to between thirty and forty thousand dollars the hangings were an embroidery of silver on crimson velvet the other articles of furniture in the apartment the mirrors the richly inlaid cabinets the toilet service of massive gold the canopies the carved chairs the curtains the tapestries and the paintings corresponded in magnificence with the bed so that catharine when she was introduced to the scene felt that she had attained to the very summit of human grandeur  for a few weeks catharine neither saw nor heard any thing of lady castlemaine she was confined to her house at the time by the care of an infant born a few days after the arrival of the queen her husband had the child baptized soon after its birth as his son and heir but the mother soon afterward had it baptized again as the son of the king charles himself standing sponsor on the occasion a violent quarrel followed between lady castlemaine and her husband she left the house taking with her all her servants and attendants and all the plate and other valuables which she could carry away the husband overwhelmed with wretchedness and shame abandoned every thing and went to france in voluntary exile his wife then came and took up her residence at richmond which is not far from hampton court so as to be near the king in all these proceedings the king himself gave her his continued countenance encouragement and aid  although catharine in the confiding simplicity of her character had fully believed in coming to london that charles would be to her a true and faithful husband still she had heard the name of lady castlemaine before she left lisbon her mother had once briefly alluded to the subject and gave her a warning charging her to remember the name and to be on her guard against the lady herself and never to tolerate her in her presence on any pretext things were in this state when one day after catharine had been about six weeks in her new home charles brought in a list of ladies whom he proposed that she should make the ladies of her household catharine took the list and there to her surprise and indignation she saw the dreaded name of lady castlemaine at the head of it  very much agitated she began to prick out the name and to declare that she could not listen to any such proposition charles was angry and remonstrated she persisted and said that he must either yield to her in that point or send her back to lisbon charles was determined to have his way and catharine was overwhelmed with anguish and grief this lasted two days when charles made his peace with his wife by solemnly promising to give up lady castlemaine and to have from that time forward nothing more to do with her  king charles ii has always been famed for his good nature this was a specimen of it he never liked to quarrel with any body and was always ready to give up his point in appearance and form at least for the sake of peace and good humor accordingly when he found how immovably averse his wife was to having lady castlemaine for an inmate of her family instead of declaring that she must and should submit to his will he gave up himself and said that he would think no more about it without however having the remotest idea of keeping his word he was only intending since he found the resistance so decided on this side of the citadel to try to find some other approach  accordingly a short time after this one evening when the queen was holding a sort of levee in a brilliant saloon surrounded by her portuguese ladies and receiving english ladies as they were one after another presented to her by the king the company were astonished at seeing lady castlemaine appear with the rest and as she advanced the king presented her to the queen to the surprise of every one catharine received her as graciously as the rest and gave her her hand the fact was that catharine not being familiar with the sound and pronunciation of english words had not understood the name one of the portuguese ladies who stood near her whispered to inquire if she knew that that was lady castlemaine catharine was stunned and staggered by the words as by a blow the blood gushed from her nose she fell over into the arms of her attendants in a fainting fit and was borne out of the room  there followed after this scene a long and dreadful quarrel charles accused his wife of unreasonable and foolish jealousy and of putting a public insult upon one of the ladies of his court whom she was bound to treat with civility and respect since he chose to have it so she on the other hand declared that he was cruel and tyrannical in making such demands upon her and that she would go back to portugal rather than submit to such an intolerable indignity she criminated charles and charles recriminated and threatened her and for one night the palace was filled with the noise and uproar of the quarrel the ladies and gentlemen of the household were very glad they said that they were not in london where there would have been so many more witnesses of the scene  some of charless counselors and ministers of state were disposed at first to remonstrate with him for laying commands on his wife with which as they expressed it flesh and blood could not comply he however peremptorily silenced all their expostulations and required them as they valued his favor to aid him in effecting his purposes good natured as he was his determination was fully aroused and he was now resolved to compel the queen to submit he wrote a letter to lord clarendon in which he declared his absolute and unalterable determination to make lady castlemaine of the queens bed chamber and hoped he might be miserable in this world and in the world to come if he failed in the least degree in what he had undertaken and if any one of his friends attempted to thwart or impede him in it in any way he would make him repent of it as long as he lived the king concluded his letter with asking clarendon to show it to some others concerned that they might all understand distinctly what they were to expect  of course every body after this took sides against the queen and all who had access to her urged her to comply with the wishes of the king she begged and prayed to be spared such an indignity she remonstrated sometimes with impetuous passion and sometimes with silent grief and bitter tears she wanted to go back again to portugal but this of course could not be the end of it was that she was worn out at last lady castlemaine was admitted and remained an inmate of her family as long as she retained her place in the kings regard  lady castlemaine was a proud and imperious beauty who abused the power which she soon found that she possessed over the king in a manner to make her an object of hatred to every one else she interfered with every thing and had a vast influence even over the affairs of state the king was sometimes out of patience and attempted resistance but she soon reduced him to submission there was once some question about sending a certain nobleman who was charged with some political offenses to the tower she declared that he should not be sent there the king rebuked her interference and they got into a high dispute on the subject the king telling her in the end that she was an impertinent jade that meddled with things she had nothing to do with to which she replied that he was a great fool that let fools have the management of his affairs and sent his faithful servants to prison in the end the lady gained the victory and the nobleman went free violent quarrels of this kind were very frequent between these high life lovers and they always ended in the triumph of lady castlemaine she used to threaten as a last resort that if the king came to an open rupture with her she would print the letters that he had written to her and this always brought him to terms  these incidents indicate a very extraordinary freedom and familiarity of manners on the part of charles and he probably appears in all these transactions to much greater disadvantage in some respects than he otherwise would have done on account of the extreme openness and frankness of his character he lived in fact on the most free and familiar terms with all around him jesting continually with every body and taking jests with perfect good nature from others in return in fact his jests gibes and frolics kept the whole court continually in a condition of frivolous gayety and fun which would have excited the astonishment of all the serious portion of mankind if the extreme and universal dissipation and vice which prevailed had not awakened a far deeper emotion  in fact there seemed to be no serious element whatever in the monarchs character he was for instance very fond of dogs and cultivated a particular breed since called king charless spaniels which he kept at one time in great numbers and in all stages of age and condition in his palace and in his very bed chamber making all the apartments around very disagreeable by the effluvia rewards were constantly offered for certain of the kings dogs which had escaped they were always escaping he was attended by these dogs wherever he went and at his meetings with his council while the gravest and most momentous national interests were under discussion he would amuse himself by playing with them under the table he read his speeches at parliament that is the brief messages with which the sovereign usually opens the session in a ridiculous manner and at church instead of attending to the service he would play at peep with lady castlemaine between the curtains which separated his box from that of the ladies of the household and yet he pretended to be a firm believer in christianity and while he had no objection to any extreme of vice he discountenanced infidelity on one occasion when a philosophical skeptic had been enlarging for some time on his objections to the christian faith charles replied by saying my lord i am a great deal older than your grace and have heard more arguments in favor of atheism than you but i have lived long enough to see that there is nothing in them and i hope your grace will  charles spent most of his time at some periods of his reign in idle amusements lounging about his palace playing at tennis in the tennis court like a boy and then weighing himself afterward to see how much he was gaining in the afternoons and evenings he would loiter in the rooms of his favorites while they were finishing their dressing gamble at cards and often would get very much intoxicated at wild midnight carousals he would ramble in the mall and in the parks and feed the aquatic birds upon the ponds there day after day with all the interest and pleasure of a truant schoolboy he roamed about thus in the most free and careless manner and accosted people far beneath him in rank in what was considered a undignified way for a king  his brother james the duke of york sometimes remonstrated with him on this subject james was of course so long as the queen charless lawful wife had no children the next heir to the crown he spent most of his life in the court of his brother and they were generally very warm friends to each other on one of charless frolicking excursions when he was away far from his palace without any suitable attendants or guards james told him that he really thought his life was not safe in such exposures charles replied by telling james not to give himself any uneasiness you may depend upon it said he that nobody will ever think of killing me to make you king  the king was not unwilling too to take himself such jests as he gave one day in conversation with a dissolute member of the court after they had been joking each other for some time he said ah shaftesbury i verily believe you are the wickedest dog in my dominions  yes replied shaftesbury for a subject i think i am  there was a mischievous and unmanageable goat in one of the palace courtyards whose name was old rowley and the courtiers considered the beast as affording so just an emblem of the character of the king that they gave the king his name charles instead of resenting it entered into the jest and one day as he was going into the apartment of some of the ladies be heard them singing a song in which he figured ridiculously as the goat he knocked at the door they asked who was there only old rowley said the king  the kings repartees were some of them really good and he obtained in his day the reputation of being quite a wit while yet all his actions and the whole of his management of his affairs were so utterly unwise and so wholly unworthy of his station that every one was struck with the contrast one of the wits of his court one day wrote an epitaph for him over his door as follows     here lies our sovereign lord the king   whose word no man relies on   who never said a foolish thing   and never did a wise one   when the king came and saw this inscription he stopped to read it and said yes that is very true and the reason is my doings are those of my ministers while my sayings are my own  charles had in fact very little to do with the public affairs of his kingdom he liked to build palaces and ships and he expended vast sums not very judiciously on these plans sir christopher wren the famous architect planned one of these palaces and charles when he went to see it complained that the rooms were too small sir christopher walked about with a selfimportant air looking up at the ceiling and said that he thought they were high enough sir christopher was very small in stature charles accordingly squatted down as well as he could to get his head in as low a position as the architects and walked about the room in that ridiculous attitude looking up in mimicry of sir christophers manner and then said oh yes now i think they are high enough  these building plans and other similar undertakings together with the vast amounts which the king lavished upon his numerous female favorites exhausted his resources and kept him in continual straits for money he was always urging parliament to make new grants and to lay more taxes until as he said himself he was ashamed to look his parliament in the face he was so continually begging them for supplies the people caricatured him by the representation of a poverty stricken man with his pockets turned inside out and begging money at another time the caricature took the form of a man led along against his will by two women and threatened by a third wearing all the time a countenance expressive of helplessness and distress  the king bore all these things with the utmost good nature satisfied apparently if he could only enjoy the pleasures of dissipation and vice and continue in his palaces a perpetual round of reckless merriment and fun some of the stories which are gravely told by the historians of the day are scarcely credible for instance it is said that a thief one day found his way in the guise of a gentleman into one of the royal drawing rooms and contrived to get a gold snuff box out of the pocket of one of the noblemen there just as he had successfully accomplished his object unobserved as he supposed he looked up and saw the kings eyes fastened upon him knowing his majestys character the thief had the presence of mind to give him a wink with a sly gesture enjoining secrecy the king nodded assent and the thief went away with his prize when the nobleman missed his snuff box the king amused himself some time with his perplexity and surprise and then told him that it was of no use for him to search for his snuff box for a thief had gone off with it half an hour ago i saw him said the king with a countenance full of fun but i could not do any thing the rascal made me his confidant and of course you know i could not betray him  under the government of such a sovereign it could not be expected that the public affairs of the realm would have gone on very prosperously still however they might have been conducted with ordinary success by his ministers and perhaps they were in fact managed as well as was usual with the governments of europe in those days it happened however that three great public calamities occurred all of a most marked and signal character which were perhaps not owing at all to causes for which charles was responsible but which have nevertheless connected such associations in mens minds with this unfortunate reign as that englishmen have since looked back upon it with very little pleasure these three calamities were the plague the fire and the dutch invasion  there have been a great many seasons of plague in london all inconceivably dreadful but as king charless fire was first among conflagrations so his plague was the greatest pestilence that ever ravaged the city london was in those days in a condition which exactly adapted it to be the easy prey of pestilence famine and fire the people were crowded together in vast masses with no comforts no cleanliness no proper organization the enormous vegetable and animal accumulations of such a multitude living more like brutes than men produced a continual miasma which prepared the constitutions of thousands for any infection which might chance to light among them pestilence is in fact the rude and dreadful remedy which nature provides for the human misery which man himself can not or will not cure when the dictates of reason and conscience are neglected or disobeyed and the ills which they might have averted sink the social state into a condition of degradation and wretchedness so great that the denser accumulations of the people become vast and corrupted swarms of vermin instead of organized communities of men then plague and fever come in as the last resorthalf remedy half retributiondevised by that mysterious principle which struggles perpetually for the preservation of the human race to thin off the excessive accumulation by destroying a portion of the surplus in so frightful a way as to drive away the rest in terror  the great plague of london took place in 1665 one year before the fire the awful scenes which the whole city presented no pen can describe a hundred thousand persons are said to have died the houses where cases of the plague existed were marked with a red cross and shut up the inmates being all fastened in to live or die at the mercy of the infection every day carts rolled through the otherwise silent and desolate streets men accompanying them to gather up with pitchforks the dead bodies which had been dragged out from the dwellings and crying bring out your dead as they went along footnote sometimes the living were pitched into the cart by mistake instead of the dead there is a piece of sculpture in the tottenham court road in london intended to commemorate the following case a scotch piper who had been wandering in homeless misery about the streets with nothing but his bagpipes and his dog got intoxicated at last as such men always do if they can in times of such extreme and awful danger and laid down upon the steps of a public building and went to sleep the cart came along in the night by torchlight and one of the men who attended it inserting the point of his fork under the poor vagabonds belt tossed him into the cart bagpipes and all the dog did all he could to defend his master but in vain the cart went thundering on the men walking along by its side examining the ways for new additions to their load the piper half awakened by the shock of his precipitation into the cart and aroused still more by the joltings of the road sat up attempted in vain to rally his bewildered faculties looked about him wondering where he was and then instinctively began to play the men astonished and terrified at such sounds from a cart loaded with the dead fled in all directions leaving the cart in the middle of the street alone  what a mysterious and inconsistent principle is fear here are men braving unconcerned and at their ease the most absolutely appalling of all possible human dangers and yet terrified out of their senses at an unexpected soundthousands went mad with their uncontrollable terror and roamed about the streets in raving delirium killing themselves and mothers killing their children in an insane and frenzied idea of escaping by that means somehow or other from the dreadful destroyer  every body whose reason remained to them avoided all possible contact or communication with others even in the country in the exchange of commodities a thousand contrivances were resorted to to avoid all personal connection in one place there was a stone where those who had any thing to sell placed their goods and then retreated while he who wished to buy came up and depositing his money on the stone in the place of the merchandise took what he had thus bought away  the great fire took place in 1666 about a year after the plague and burned a very large part of london it commenced accidentally in a bakers shop where a great store of fagots had been collected and spread so rapidly among the buildings which surrounded the spot that it was soon entirely beyond control the city of london was then composed of an immense mass of mean buildings crowded densely together with very narrow streets intervening and the wind carried the flames with inconceivable rapidity far and wide the people seemed struck universally with a sense of terror and despair and nothing was to be heard but shrieks outcries and wild lamentations the sky was one vast lurid canopy like molten brass day and night for four days while the whole city presented a scene of indescribable and awful din the cracking and thundering of the flames the frenzied screams of the women and children the terrific falling of spires towers walls and lofty battlements the frightful explosions of the houses blown up by gunpowder in the vain hope of stopping the progress of the flames all formed a scene of grandeur so terrific and dreadful that they who witnessed the spectacle were haunted by the recollection of it long afterward as by a frightful dream a tall monument was built upon the spot where the bakers shop stood to commemorate the calamity the fire held in fact in the estimation of mankind the rank of the greatest and most terrible of all conflagrations until the burning of moscow in the time of napoleon in some degree eclipsed its fame  the dutch invasion was the third great calamity which signalized king charless unfortunate reign the ships of the enemy came up the thames and the medway which is a branch of the thames they took possession of a fort at sheerness near the mouth of the river and after seizing all the military stores which had been collected there to an enormous amount they set fire to the powder magazine and blew up the whole fortress with a terrific explosion the way was now open to them to london unless the english could contrive some way to arrest their progress they attempted to do this by sinking some ships in the river and drawing a strong chain across from one sunken vessel to the other and fastening the ends to the shores the dutch however broke through this obstruction they seized an opportunity when the tide was setting strongly up the river and a fresh wind was blowing their ships impelled thus by a double force broke through the chains passed safely between the sunken ships and came on in triumph up the river throwing the city of london into universal consternation there were several english ships of war and several dutch ships which had been captured and brought up the thames as prizes lying in the river these vessels were all seized by the dutch and burned one of the english ships which they thus destroyed was called the royal oak  of course there was now a universal scene of confusion and terror in london every body laid the blame of the calamity upon the king the money which he had received for building ships and other national defenses he had squandered they said upon his guilty pleasures then the war which had resulted in this invasion was caused by the political mismanagement of his reign while the people however thus loudly condemned the conduct of their monarch they went energetically at work to arrest the progress of their invaders they sunk other ships in greater numbers and built platforms on which they raised batteries of cannon at length the further progress of the enemy was stopped and the ships were finally compelled to retire  among the other events which occurred during the reign of king charles the second and which tended to connect unfavorable associations with the recollection of it in the minds of men was a very extraordinary affair which is known in history by the name of titus oatess popish plot it was the story of a plot said to have been formed by the catholics to put king charles to death and place his brother james who it will be recollected was a catholic upon the throne in his stead the story of this plot was told by a man named titus oates and as it was at first generally believed it occasioned infinite trouble and difficulty in after times however the whole story came to be regarded as the fabrication of oates without there being any foundation for it whatever hence the name of titus oatess popish plot by which the affair has always since been designated in history the circumstances were these  among his other various accomplishments king charles was quite a chemist and philosopher he had a laboratory where he amused himself with experiments having of course several persons associated with him and attendant upon him in these researches among these was a man named kirby mr kirby was an intelligent man of agreeable manners and of considerable scientific attainments charles devoted at some periods of his life a considerable portion of his time to these researches in experimental philosophy and he took likewise an interest in facilitating the progress of others in the same pursuits there was a small society of philosophers that was accustomed to meet sometimes in oxford and sometimes in london the object of this society was to provide apparatus and other facilities for making experiments and to communicate to each other at their meetings the result of their investigations the king took this society under his patronage and made it as it were his own he gave it the name of the royal society and granted it a charter by which it was incorporated as a permanent organization with the most ample powers this association has since become one of the most celebrated learned societies in the world and its establishment is one of the very few transactions of king charless reign which have been since remembered with pleasure  but to return to mr kirby one day when the king was walking in the park with a party of companions and attendants who were separated more or less from him as was usual on such occasions mr kirby came up to him and with a mysterious and earnest air begged the king not to allow himself to be separated from the company for his life he said was in danger keep with your company sir said he your enemies have a design upon your life you may be suddenly shot on this very walk charles was not easily frightened and he received this announcement with great composure he asked an explanation however and mr kirby informed him that a plot had been formed by the catholics to destroy him that two men had been engaged to shoot him and to make the result doubly sure another arrangement had been made to poison him the queens physician was the person he said who was charged with this latter design mr kirby said moreover that there was a clergyman dr tong who was fully acquainted with all the particulars of the plot and that if the king would grant him an interview that evening he would make them all known  the king agreed to this and in the evening dr tong was introduced he had a budget of papers which he began to open and read but charles had not patience to hear them his mind was full of a plan which he was contemplating of going to windsor the next day to look at some new decorations which he had ordered for several of the apartments of the palace he did not believe in the existence of any plot it is true that plots and conspiracies were very common in those days but false rumors and unfounded tales of plots were more common still there was so much excitement in the minds of the community on the subject of the catholic and protestant faith and such vastly extended interests depended on whether the sovereign belonged to one side or the other on this question that every thing relating to the subject was invested with a mysterious awe and the most wonderful stories were readily circulated and believed the public mind was always particularly sensitive and excitable in such a case as that of charles and his brother james at the time of which we are writing where the reigning monarch charles was of one religious faith and his brother james the next heir was of the other the death of charles which might at any time take place would naturally lead to a religious revolution and this kept the whole community in an exceedingly excitable and feverish state there was a great temptation to form plots on the one hand and a great eagerness to discover them on the other and any man who could tell a story of treasonable schemes whether his tale was true or fabricated became immediately a personage of great importance  charles was well aware of these things and was accordingly disposed to pay very little attention to dr tongs papers he said he had no time to look into them and so he referred the whole case to the lord treasurer danby an officer of his court whom he requested to examine into the affair dr tong therefore laid his papers before danby while the king went off the next day to windsor to examine the new fresco paintings and the other decorations of the palace  danby was disposed to regard the story in a very different light from that in which it had appeared to the king it is said that there were some charges about to be brought forward against himself for certain malpractices in his office and that he was very much pleased accordingly at the prospect of having something come up to attract public attention and turn it away from his own misdemeanors he listened therefore with great interest to dr tongs account of the plot and made many minute and careful inquiries dr tong informed him that he had himself no personal knowledge of the conspiracy that the papers which contained all the information that he was possessed of had been thrown into the hall of his house from the front door and that he did not certainly know by whom though he suspected he said one titus oates who had formerly been a catholic priest and was still so far connected with the catholics as to have very favorable opportunities to become acquainted with their designs  soon after this dr tong had another interview with the lord treasurer and informed him that his surmise had proved true that it was titus oates who had drawn up the papers and that he was informed in regard to all the particulars of the plot but that he did not dare to do any thing openly in revealing them for fear that the conspirators would kill him the lord treasurer communicated the result of his inquiries to the king and urged the affair upon his attention as one of the utmost possible importance the king himself however was very skeptical on the subject he laughed at the lord treasurers earnestness and anxiety the lord treasurer wished to have a meeting of the council called that the case might be laid before them but charles refused nobody should know any thing about it he said not even his brother it would only create excitement and alarm and perhaps put it into somebodys head to murder him though nobody at present had any such design  but notwithstanding the kings determination not to give publicity to the story of the plot rumors of it gradually transpired and began to excite attention the fact that such stories were in circulation soon came to the knowledge of the duke of york and of course immediately arrested his earnest attention as he was himself a catholic and the heir to the crown any suspicion of a catholic plot formed to dethrone his brother necessarily implicated him he demanded an examination into the case in a short time vague but exaggerated rumors on the subject began to circulate through the community at large which awakened of course a very general anxiety and alarm so great was the virulence of both political and religious animosities in those days that no one knew to what scenes of persecution or of massacre such secret conspiracies might tend oates whose only object was to bring himself into notice and to obtain rewards for making known the plot which he had pretended to discover now found to his great satisfaction that the fire which he had kindled was beginning to burn the meeting of the council was called and he was summoned to attend it before the time arrived however he went to a justice of the peace and laid the evidence before him of the existence of the conspiracy and of all the details respecting it which he pretended to have discovered the name of this justice was sir edmondsbury godfrey a remarkable circumstance afterward occurred in respect to him as will presently be related which greatly increased and extended the popular excitement in relation to the pretended plot  the plot as oates invented and detailed it was on the most magnificent scale imaginable the pope himself was at the head of it the pope he said had laid the subject before a society of learned theologians at rome and they had decided that in such a case as that of england where the sovereign and a majority of the people had renounced the true religion and given themselves up to avowed and open heresy the monarch lost all title to his crown and the realms thus fallen from the faith lapsed to the pope and were to be reclaimed by him by any mode which it seemed to him expedient to adopt under these circumstances the pope had assumed the sovereignty over england and had commissioned the society of the jesuitsa very powerful religious society extending over most of the countries of europeto take possession of the realm that in the prosecution of this plan the king was to be assassinated and that a very large sum of money had been raised and set apart to be paid to any person who would kill the king that an offer of ten thousand pounds had been made to the queens physician if he would poison him the physician had insisted upon fifteen thousand for so great a service and this demand had finally been acceded to and five thousand had actually been paid him in advance besides the murder of the king a general assassination of the protestants was to take place there were twenty thousand catholics in london for instance who according to oatess account of the plan were to rise on a preconcerted night and each one was to kill five protestants which it was thought they could easily do as the protestants would be taken wholly by surprise and would be unarmed the revolution being thus effected the crown was to be offered to charless brother the duke of york as a gift from the pope and if he should refuse to accept it on such conditions as the pope might see fit to impose he was himself to be immediately assassinated and some other disposal to be made of the kingdom  oates was examined before the council very closely and he contradicted himself so much and made so many misstatements about absent persons and the places where he pretended that certain transactions had taken place as to prove the falseness of his whole story the public however knew little or thought little of these proofs they hated the catholics and were eager to believe and to circulate any thing which tended to excite the public mind against them the most extravagant stories were accordingly circulated and most excessive and universal fears prevailed increasing continually by the influence of mutual action and reaction and of sympathy until the whole country was in a state of terror a circumstance now occurred which added tenfold to the excitement and produced in fact a general consternation  this circumstance was the sudden and mysterious death of sir edmondsbury godfrey the justice who had taken the depositions of oates in respect to the conspiracy he had been missing for several days and at length his body was found in a trench by the side of a field in a solitary place not far from london his own sword had been run into his body and was remaining in the wound his watch and his money were safe in his pocket showing that he had not been killed by robbers this event added greatly to the excitement that prevailed the story was circulated that he had been killed by the catholics for having aided in publishing the discovery of their plot they who wished to believe oatess story found in the justices death most ample confirmation of it the body was brought forward and exhibited to the public gaze in a grand procession which moved through the streets of london and at the funeral guards were stationed one on each side of the preacher while he was delivering the funeral discourse to impress the people with a sense of the desperate recklessness of catholic hate by the implication that even a minister of the gospel in the exercise of the most solemn of his functions was not safe without an effectual guard  from this time the excitement and commotion went on increasing at a very rapid rate oates himself of course became immediately a man of great importance and to maintain himself in his new position he invented continually new stories each more terrible than the preceding new informers too began to appear confirming oatess statements and adding new details of their own that they might share his distinctions and rewards these men became continually more and more bold in proportion to the increasing readiness of the people to receive their inventions for truths they accused persons of higher and higher rank until at last they dared to implicate the queen herself in their charges they knew that as she was a catholic she was unpopular with the nation at large and as charles had so many other lady favorites they concluded that he would feel no interest in vindicating her from false aspersions they accordingly brought forward accusations against the queen of having joined in the conspiracy of having been privy to the plan of murdering the king and of having actually arranged and directed the assassination of the justice sir edmondsbury these charges produced of course great excitement the people of the country were generally predisposed to believe them true there were various investigations of them and long protracted examinations of the witnesses before the council and before judicial commissions appointed to inquire into and decide upon the case these inquisitions led to debates and disputes to criminations and recriminations without number and they threw the whole court and the whole nation into a state of extreme excitement some taking sides against and some in favor of the queen although the popular sentiment was against her every fair and candid mind that attended carefully to the evidence decided unhesitatingly in her favor the stories of the witnesses were utterly inconsistent with each other and in many of their details impossible still so great was the public credulity and so eager the desire to believe every thing however absurd which would arouse and strengthen the anticatholic feeling that the queen found herself soon the object of extreme and universal odium  the king however much to his credit refused all belief of these accusations against catharine and strongly defended her cause he took care to have the witnesses cross examined and to have the inconsistencies in their testimony and the utter impossibility that their statements could be true pointed out he believed he said that she was entirely innocent and that the whole plan was a conspiracy to effect her destruction they think i suppose said the king that i should like a new wife but i will not suffer an innocent woman to be wronged he also told one of the ministers of state in speaking of the subject that considering how hardly he had treated his wife and how much reason she had for just complaints against him it would be an atrocious thing for him to abandon her in such an extremity  a volume might be filled with stories of the strange and exciting incidents that grew out of this pretended popish plot its consequences extended disastrously through many years and involved a vast number of innocent persons in irretrievable ruin the true character of oates and his accomplices was however at length fully proved and they themselves suffered the fate at last which they had brought upon others the whole affair was a disgrace to the age there is no circumstance connected with it which can be looked upon with any pleasure except king charless fidelity to his injured wife in refusing to abandon her though he no longer loved her his defense of her innocence involving as it did a continuance of the matrimonial tie which bound them together when all the world supposed that he wished it sundered seems to have resulted from a conscientious sense of duty and implies certain latent traits of generosity and nobleness in charless character which though ordinarily overpowered and nullified by the influences of folly and vice still always seem to have maintained their hold and to come out to view from time to time in the course of the gay monarchs life whenever any emergency occurred sufficient to call them into action  the reign of king charles the second was signalized by many other untoward and disastrous events besides those which we have enumerated there were unfortunate wars great defeats in naval battles unlucky negotiations abroad and plots and conspiracies dangerous and disgraceful at home the king however took all these things very good naturedly and allowed them to interfere very little with his own personal pleasures whatever troubles or embarrassments affected the state he left the anxiety and care which pertained to them to his ministers and his council banishing all solicitude from his own mind and enjoying himself all the time with his experiments his ladies his dogs and his perpetual fun     chapter xii  the conclusion    time rolled on and the gay and pleasureloving king passed through one decade after another of his career until at length he came to be over fifty years of age his health was firm and his mental powers vigorous he looked forward to many years of strength and activity yet to come and thus though he had passed the meridian of his life he made no preparations to change the pursuits and habits in which he had indulged himself in his early years  he died suddenly at last at the age of fiftyfour his death was almost as sudden as that of his father though in a widely different way the circumstances of his last sickness have strongly attracted the attention of mankind on account of the manner in which the dying king was affected at last by remorse at the recollection of his life of reckless pleasure and sin and of the acts to which this remorse led him upon his dying bed the vices and crimes of monarchs like those of other men may be distinguished into two great types characterized by the feelings of heart in which they take their origin some of these crimes arise from the malignant passions of the soul others from the irregular and perverted action of the feelings of kindness and affection the errors and follies of charles ending at last as they did in the most atrocious sins were of the latter class it was in feelings of kindness and good will toward friends of his own sex that originated that spirit of favoritism so unworthy of a monarch which he so often evinced and even his irregular and unhallowed attachments of another kind seem to have been not wholly selfish and sensual the course of conduct which he pursued through the whole course of his life toward his female companions evinced in many instances a sincere attachment to them and an honest desire to promote their welfare and in all the wild recklessness of his life of pleasure and vice there was seen coming out continually into view the influence of some conscientious sense of duty and of a desire to promote the happiness of those around him and to do justice to all these principle were indeed too feeble to withstand the temptations by which they were assailed on every side still they did not cease to exist and occasions were continually occurring when they succeeded in making their persuasions heard in a word king charless errors and sins atrocious and inexcusable as they were sprang from illregulated and perverted feelings of love and good will and not from selfishness and hate from the kindly and not from the malignant propensities of the soul it is very doubtful whether this is really any palliation of them but at any rate mankind generally regard it so judging very leniently as they always do the sins and crimes which have such an origin  it is probable that charles derived whatever moral principle and sensitiveness of conscience that he possessed from the influence of his mother in his early years she was a faithful and devoted catholic she honestly and firmly believed that the rites and usages of the catholic church were divinely ordained and that a careful and honest conformity to them was the only way to please god and to prepare for heaven she did all in her power to bring up her children in this faith and in the high moral and religious principles of conduct which were in her mind indissolubly connected with it she derived this spirit in her turn from her mother mary de medici who was one of the most extraordinary characters of ancient or modern times when henrietta maria was married to charles i and went to england this mary de medici her mother wrote her a letter of counsel and of farewell which we recommend to our readers careful perusal it is true we go back to the third generation from the hero of this story to reach the document but it illustrates so well the manner in which maternal influence passes down from age to age and throws so much light on the strange scenes which occurred at charless death and is moreover so intrinsically excellent that it well merits the digression  the queenmother mary de medici to the young queen of england henrietta maria

would rather see him die than to live so as to offend god in whom we move and who is the end of our being it was with such precepts that he commenced his holy career it was this that rendered him

devout sense of responsibility to almighty god and the spirit of submission and obedience to his will which this letter breathes descended from the grandmother to the mother and were even instilled in some degree into the heart of the son they remained however latent and dormant through the long years of the monarchs life of frivolity and sin but they revived and reasserted their dominion when the end came  the dying scene opened upon the kings vision in a very abrupt and sudden manner he had been somewhat unwell during a certain day in february when he was about fiftyfour years of age his illness however did not interrupt the ordinary orgies and carousals of his palace it was sunday in the evening a very gay assembly was convened in the apartments engaged in deep gaming and other dissolute and vicious pleasures the king mingled in these scenes though he complained of being unwell his head was giddyhis appetite was gonehis walk was unsteady when the party broke up at midnight he went into one of the neighboring apartments and they prepared for him some light and simple food suitable for a sick man but he could not take it he retired to his bed but he passed a restless and uneasy night he arose however the next morning and attempted to dress himself but before he finished the work he was suddenly struck by that grim and terrible messenger and coadjutor of deathapoplexyas by a blow stunned by the stroke he staggered and fell  the dreadful paroxysm of insensibility and seeming death in a case of apoplexy is supposed to be occasioned by a pressure of blood upon the brain and the remedy according to the practice of those days was to bleed the patient immediately to relieve this pressure and to blister or cauterize the head to excite a high external action as a means of subduing the disease within it was the law of england that such violent remedies could not be resorted to in the case of the sovereign without authority previously obtained from the council they were guilty of high treason who should presume to do so this was a case however which admitted of no delay the attendants put their own lives at hazard to serve that of the king they bled him with a penknife and heated the iron for the cautery the alarm was spread throughout the palace producing universal confusion the queen was summoned and came as soon as possible to the scene she found her husband sitting senseless in a chair a basin of blood by his side his countenance deathlike and ghastly while some of the attendants were attempting to force the locked jaws apart that they might administer a potion and others were applying a red hot iron to the patients head in a desperate endeavor to arouse and bring back again into action the benumbed and stupefied sensibilities queen catharine was so shocked by the horrid spectacle that she sank down in a fit of fainting and convulsions and was borne immediately away back to her own apartment  in two hours the patients suspended faculties began to return he looked wildly about him and asked for the queen they sent for her she was not able to come she was however so far restored as to be able to send a message and an apology saying that she was very glad to hear that he was better and was much concerned that she could not come to see him she also added that for whatever she had done in the course of her life to displease him she now asked his pardon and hoped he would forgive her the attendants communicated this message to the king poor lady said charles she beg my pardon i am sure i beg hers with all my heart  apoplexy fulfills the dread behest of its terrible master death by dealing its blow once with a fatal energy and then retiring from the field leaving the stunned and senseless patient to recover in some degree from the first effect of the stroke but only to sink down and die at last under the permanent and irretrievable injuries which almost invariably follow  things took this course in the case of charles he revived from the stupor and insensibility of the first attack and lay afterward for several days upon his bed wandering in mind helpless in body full of restlessness and pain and yet conscious of his condition he saw dimly and obscurely indeed but yet with awful certainty that his ties to earth had been suddenly sundered and that there only remained to him now a brief and troubled interval of mental bewilderment and bodily distress to last for a few more hours or days and then he must appear before that dread tribunal where his last account was to be rendered and the vast work of preparation for the solemn judgment was yet to be made how was this to be done  of course the great palace of whitehall where the royal patient was lying was all in confusion attendants were hurrying to and fro councils of physicians were deliberating in solemn assemblies on the case and ordaining prescriptions with the formality which royal etiquette required the courtiers were thunderstruck and confounded at the prospect of the total revolution which was about to ensue and in which all their hopes and prospects might be totally ruined james the duke of york seeing himself about to be suddenly summoned to the throne was full of eager interest in the preliminary arrangements to secure his safe and ready accession he was engaged night and day in selecting officers signing documents and stationing guards catharine mourned in her own sick chamber the approaching blow which was to separate her forever from her husband deprive her of her consequence and her rank and consign her for the rest of her days to the pains and sorrows and the dreadful solitude of heart which pertains to widowhood the kings other female intimates too of whom there were three still remaining in his court and in his palace were distracted with real grief they may have loved him sincerely they certainly gave every indication of true affection for him in this his hour of extremity they could not appear at his bedside except at sudden and stolen interviews which were quickly terminated by their being required to withdraw but they hovered near with anxious inquiries or else mourned in their apartments with bitter grief without the palace the effects were scarcely less decisive the tidings spread every where throughout the kingdom arresting universal attention and awakening an anxiety so widely diffused and so intense as almost to amount to a terror a catholic monarch was about to ascend the throne and no one knew what national calamities were impending  in the mean time the dying monarch lay helpless upon his bed in the alcove of his apartment distressed and wretched to look back upon the past filled him with remorse and the dread futurity now close at hand was full of images of terror and dismay he thought of his wife and of the now utterly irreparable injuries which he had done her he thought of his other intimates and their numerous children and of the condition in which they would be left by his death if he had been more entirely sensual and selfish in his attachments he would have suffered less but he could not dismiss these now wretched participators in his sins from his mind he could do very little now to promote their future welfare or to atone for the injury which he had done them but his anxiety to do so as well as his utter helplessness in accomplishing his desire was evinced by his saying in his last charge to his brother james just before he died that he hoped he would be kind to his children and especially not let poor nelly starve footnote eleanor gwyn she was an actress when charles first became acquainted with her  troubled and distressed with these thoughts and still more anxious and wretched at the prospect of his own approaching summons before the bar of god the fallen monarch lay upon his dying bed earnestly desiring but not daring to ask for the only possible relief which was now left to him the privilege of seeking refuge in the religious hopes and consolations which his mother in years now long gone by had vainly attempted to teach him to love the way of salvation through the ministrations and observances of the catholic service was the only way of salvation that he could possibly see it is true that he had been all his life a protestant but protestantism was to him only a political faith it had nothing to do with moral accountability or preparation for heaven the spiritual views of acceptance with god by simple personal penitence and faith in the atoning sacrifice of his son which lie at the foundation of the system of the church of england he never conceived of the church of england was to him a mere empty form it was the service of the ancient catholic faith disrobed of its sanctions despoiled of its authority and deprived of all its spirit and soul it was the mere idle form of godless and heartless men of the world empty and vain it had answered his purpose as a part of the pageantry of state during his life of pomp and pleasure but it seemed a mockery to him now as a means of leading his wretched and ruined soul to a reconciliation with his maker every thing that was sincere and earnest and truly devout in the duties of piety were associated in his mind with the memory of his mother and as death drew nigh he longed to return to her fold and to have a priest who was clothed with the authority to which her spirit had been accustomed to bow come and be the mediator between himself and his maker and secure and confirm the reconciliation  but how could this be done it was worse than treason to aid or abet the tainting of the soul of an english protestant king with the abominations of popery the king knew this very well and was aware that if he were to make his wishes known whoever should assist him in attaining the object of his desire would hazard his life by the act knowing too in what abhorrence the catholic faith was held he naturally shrank from avowing his convictions and thus deterred by the difficulties which surrounded him he gave himself up to despair and let the hours move silently on which were drawing him so rapidly toward the grave there were among the other attendants and courtiers who crowded around his bedside several high dignitaries of the church at one time five bishops were in his chamber they proposed repeatedly that the king should partake of the sacrament this was a customary rite to be performed upon the dying it being considered the symbol and seal of a final reconciliation with god and preparation for heaven whenever the proposal was made the king declined or evaded it he said he was too weak or not now or there will be time enough yet and thus day after day moved on  in the mean time the anxious and unhappy queen had so far recovered that she came to see the king and was often at his bedside watching his symptoms and mourning over his approaching fate these interviews were however all public for the large apartment in which the king was lying was always full there were ladies of the court too who claimed the privilege which royal etiquette accorded them of always accompanying the queen on these visits to the bedside of her dying husband she could say nothing in private and then besides her agitation and distress were so extreme that she was incapable of any thing like calm and considerate action  among the favorite intimates of the king perhaps the most prominent was the duchess of portsmouth the king himself had raised her to that rank she was a french girl who came over originally from the continent with a party of visitors from the french court her beauty her wit and her accomplishments soon made her a great favorite with the king and for many years of his life she had exerted an unbounded and a guilty influence over him she was a catholic though not allowed to come to his bedside she remained in her apartment overwhelmed with grief at the approaching death of her lover and strange as it may seem she was earnestly desirous to obtain for him the spiritual succors which as a catholic she considered essential to his dying in peace after repeated and vain endeavors made in other ways to accomplish her object she at length sent for the french ambassador to come to her rooms from the kings chamber and urged him to do something to save the dying sinners soul he is in heart a catholic said she i am sure he wishes to receive the catholic sacraments i can not do any thing and the duke of york is so full of business and excitement that he does not think of it but something must be done  the ambassador went in pursuit of the duke of york he took him aside and with great caution and secrecy suggested the subject you are right said the duke and there is no time to lose the duke went to the kings chamber the english clergymen had just been offering the king the sacrament once more and he had declined it again james asked them to retire from the alcove as he wished to speak privately to his majesty they did so supposing that he wished to communicate with him on some business of state  sire said the duke to his dying brother you decline the sacraments of the protestant church will you receive those of the catholic  the countenance of the dying man evinced a faint though immediate expression of returning animation and pleasure at this suggestion yes said he i would give every thing in the world to see a priest  i will bring you one said james  do said the king for gods sake do but shall you not expose yourself to danger by it  i will bring you one though it cost me my life replied the duke  this conversation was held in a whisper to prevent its being overheard by the various groups in the room the duke afterward said that he had to repeat his words several times to make the king comprehend them his sense of hearing having obviously begun to fail  there was great difficulty in procuring a priest the french and spanish priests about the court who were attached to the service of the ambassadors and of the queen excused themselves on various pretexts they were in fact afraid of the consequences to themselves which might follow from an act so strictly prohibited by law at last an english priest was found his name was huddleston he had at one time concealed the king in his house during his adventures and wanderings after the battle of worcester on account of this service he had been protected by the government of the king ever since that time from the pains and penalties which had driven most of the catholic priests from the kingdom  they sent for father huddleston to come to the palace he arrived about seven oclock in the evening they disguised him with a wig and cassock which was the usual dress of a clergyman of the church of england as the illegal ceremony about to be performed required the most absolute secrecy it became necessary to remove all the company from the room the duke accordingly informed them that the king wished to be alone for a short period and he therefore requested that they would withdraw into the anteroom when they had done so father huddleston was brought in by a little door near the head of the bed which opened directly into the alcove where the bed was laid there was a narrow space or alley by the side of the bed within the alcove called the ruelle footnote ruelle is a french word meaning little street or alley this way to the bed was the one so often referred to in the histories of those times by the phrase the back stairs with this the private door communicated directly and the party attending the priest entering stationed themselves there to perform in secrecy and danger the last solemn rites of catholic preparation for heaven it was an extraordinary scene the mighty monarch of a mighty realm hiding from the vigilance of his own laws that he might steal an opportunity to escape the consequences of having violated the laws of heaven  they performed over the now helpless monarch the rites which the catholic church prescribes for the salvation of the dying sinner these rites though empty and unmeaning ceremonies to those who have no religious faith in them are full of the most profound impressiveness and solemnity for those who have the priest having laid aside his protestant disguise administered the sacrament of the mass which was according to the catholic views a true and actual reenacting of the sacrifice of christ to inure to the special benefit of the individual soul for which it was offered the priest then received the penitents confession of sin expressed in a faint and feeble assent to the words of contrition which the church prescribes and this was followed by a pardona true and actual pardon as the sinner supposed granted and declared by a commissioner fully empowered by authority from heaven both to grant and declare it then came the extreme unction or in other words the last anointing in which a little consecrated oil was touched to the eyelids the lips the ears and the hands as a symbol and a seal of the final purification and sanctification of the senses which had been through life the means and instruments of sin the extreme unction is the last rite this being performed the dying catholic feels that all is well his sins have been atoned for and forgiven and he has himself been purified and sanctified soul and body the services in charless case occupied three quarters of an hour and then the doors were opened and the attendants and company were admitted again  the night passed on and though the kings mind was relieved he suffered much bodily agony in the morning when he perceived that it was light he asked the attendants to open the curtains that he might see the sun for the last time it gave him but a momentary pleasure for he was restless and in great suffering some pains which he endured increased so much that it was decided to bleed him the operation relieved the suffering but exhausted the sufferers strength so that he soon lost the power of speech and lay afterward helpless and almost insensible longing for the relief which now nothing but death could bring him this continued till about noon when he ceased to breathe  the end
