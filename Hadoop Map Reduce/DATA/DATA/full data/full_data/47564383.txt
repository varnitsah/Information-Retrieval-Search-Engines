47564383	the patrician   by john galsworthy     part i    chapter i  light entering the vast rooma room so high that its carved ceiling refused itself to exact scrutinytravelled with the wistful cold curiosity of the dawn over a fantastic storehouse of time light unaccompanied by the prejudice of human eyes made strange revelation of incongruities as though illuminating the dispassionate march of history  for in this dining hallone of the finest in englandthe caradoc family had for centuries assembled the trophies and records of their existence round about this dining hall they had built and pulled down and restored until the rest of monkland court presented some aspect of homogeneity here alone they had left virgin the work of the old quasimonastic builders and within it unconsciously deposited their souls for there were here meeting the eyes of light all those rather touching evidences of mans desire to persist for ever those shells of his former bodies the fetishes and queer proofs of his faiths together with the remorseless demonstration of their treatment at the hands of time  the annalist might here have found all his needed confirmations the analyst from this material formed the due equation of high birth the philosopher traced the course of aristocracy from its primeval rise in crude strength or subtlety through centuries of power to picturesque decadence and the beginnings of its last stand even the artist might here perchance have seized on the dry ineffable pervading spirit as one visiting an old cathedral seems to scent out the constriction of its heart  from the legendary sword of that welsh chieftain who by an act of high rewarded treachery had passed into the favour of the conquering william and received with the widow of a norman many lands in devonshire to the cup purchased for geoffrey caradoc present earl of valleys by subscription of his devonshire tenants on the occasion of his marriage with the lady gertrude semmeringno insignia were absent save the family portraits in the gallery of valleys house in london there was even an ancient duplicate of that yellow tattered scroll royally reconfirming lands and title to john the most distinguished of all the caradocs who had unfortunately neglected to be born in wedlock by one of those humorous omissions to be found in the genealogies of most old families yes it was there almost cynically hung in a corner for this incident though no doubt a burning question in the fifteenth century was now but staple for an ironical little tale in view of the fact that descendants of johns own brother edmund were undoubtedly to be found among the cottagers of a parish not far distant  light glancing from the suits of armour to the tiger skins beneath them brought from india but a year ago by bertie caradoc the younger son seemed recording how those who had once been foremost by virtue of that simple law of nature which crowns the adventuring and strong now being almost washed aside out of the main stream of national life were compelled to devise adventure lest they should lose belief in their own strength  the unsparing light of that first halfhour of summer morning recorded many other changes wandering from austere tapestries to the velvety carpets and dragging from the contrast sure proof of a common sense which denied to the present earl and countess the asceticisms of the past and then it seemed to lose interest in this critical journey as though longing to clothe all in witchery for the sun had risen and through the eastern windows came pouring its level and mysterious joy and with it passing in at an open lattice came a wild bee to settle among the flowers on the table athwart the eastern end used when there was only a small party in the house the hours fled on silent till the sun was high and the first visitors camethree maids rosy not silent bringing brushes they passed and were followed by two footmenscouts of the breakfast brigade who stood for a moment professionally doing nothing then soberly commenced to set the table then came a little girl of six to see if there were anything excitinglittle ann shropton child of sir william shropton by his marriage with lady agatha and eldest daughter of the house the only one of the four young caradocs as yet wedded she came on tiptoe thinking to surprise whatever was there she had a broad little face and wide frank hazel eyes over a little nose that came out straight and sudden encircled by a loose belt placed far below the waist of her holland frock as if to symbolize freedom she seemed to think everything in life good fun and soon she found the exciting thing  heres a bumble bee william do you think i could tame it in my little glass bog  no i dont miss ann and look out youll be stung  it wouldnt sting me  why not  because it wouldnt  of courseif you say so  what time is the motor ordered  nine oclock  im going with grandpapa as far as the gate  suppose he says youre not  well then i shall go all the same  i see  i might go all the way with him to london is auntie babs going  no i dont think anybody is going with his lordship  i would if she were william  yes  is uncle eustace sure to be elected  of course he is  do you think hell be a good member of parliament  lord miltoun is very clever miss ann  is he  well dont you think so  does charles think so  ask him  william  yes  i dont like london i like here and i like cotton and i like home pretty well and i love pendridnyandi like ravensham  his lordship is going to ravensham today on his way up i heard say  oh then hell see greatgranny william  heres miss wallace  from the doorway a lady with a broad pale patient face said  come ann  all right hallo simmons  the entering butler replied  hallo miss ann  ive got to go  im sure were very sorry  yes  the door banged faintly and in the great room rose the busy silence of those minutes which precede repasts suddenly the four men by the breakfast fable stood back lord valleys had come in  he approached slowly reading a blue paper with his level grey eyes divided by a little uncharacteristic frown he had a tanned yet ruddy decisively shaped face with crisp hair and moustache beginning to go irongreythe face of a man who knows his own mind and is contented with that knowledge his figure too wellbraced and upright with the back of the head carried like a soldiers confirmed the impression not so much of selfsufficiency as of the sufficiency of his habits of life and thought and there was apparent about all his movements that peculiar unconsciousness of his surroundings which comes to those who live a great deal in the public eye have the material machinery of existence placed exactly to their hands and never need to consider what others think of them taking his seat and still perusing the paper he at once began to eat what was put before him then noticing that his eldest daughter had come in and was sitting down beside him he said  bore having to go up in such weather  is it a cabinet meeting  yes this confounded business of the balloons but the rather anxious dark eyes of agathas delicate narrow face were taking in the details of a tray for keeping dishes warm on a sideboard and she was thinking i believe that would be better than the ones ive got after all if william would only say whether he really likes these large trays better than single hotwater dishes she contrived however to ask in her gentle voicefor all her words and movements were gentle even a little timid till anything appeared to threaten the welfare of her husband or children  do you think this war scare good for eustaces prospects father  but her father did not answer he was greeting a newcomer a tall finelooking young man with dark hair and a fair moustache between whom and himself there was no relationship yet a certain negative resemblance claud fresnay viscount harbinger was indeed also a little of what is called the norman typehaving a certain firm regularity of feature and a slight aquilinity of nose high up on the bridgebut that which in the elder man seemed to indicate only an unconscious acceptance of self as a standard in the younger man gave an impression at once more assertive and more uneasy as though he were a little afraid of not chaffing something all the time  behind him had come in a tall woman of full figure and fine presence with hair still brownlady valleys herself though her eldest son was thirty she was herself still little more than fifty from her voice manner and whole personality one might suspect that she had been an acknowledged beauty but there was now more than a suspicion of maturity about her almost jovial face with its full greyblue eyes and coarsened complexion good comrade and essentially woman of the world was written on every line of her and in every tone of her voice she was indeed a figure suggestive of open air and generous living endowed with abundant energy and not devoid of humour it was she who answered agathas remark  of course my dear the very best thing possible  lord harbinger chimed in  by the way brabrooks going to speak on it did you ever hear him lady agatha mr speaker sir i riseand with me rises the democratic principle  but agatha only smiled for she was thinking  if i let ann go as far as the gate shell only make it a steppingstone to something else tomorrow taking no interest in public affairs her inherited craving for command had resorted for expression to a meticulous ordering of household matters it was indeed a cult with her a passionas though she felt herself a sort of figurehead to national domesticity the leader of a patriotic movement  lord valleys having finished what seemed necessary arose  any message to your mother gertrude  no i wrote last night  tell miltoun to keepan eye on that mr courtier i heard him speak one dayhes rather good  lady valleys who had not yet sat down accompanied her husband to the door  by the way ive told mother about this woman geoff  was it necessary  well i think so im uneasyafter all mother has some influence with miltoun  lord valleys shrugged his shoulders and slightly squeezing his wifes arm went out  though himself vaguely uneasy on that very subject he was a man who did not go to meet disturbance he had the nerves which seem to be no nerves at allespecially found in those of his class who have much to do with horses he temperamentally regarded the evil of the day as quite sufficient to it moreover his eldest son was a riddle that he had long given up so far as women were concerned  emerging into the outer hall he lingered a moment remembering that he had not seen his younger and favourite daughter  lady barbara down yet hearing that she was not he slipped into the motor coat held for him by simmons and stepped out under the white portico decorated by the caradoc hawks in stone  the voice of little ann reached him clear and high above the smothered whirring of the car  come on grandpapa  lord valleys grimaced beneath his crisp moustachethe word grandpapa always fell queerly on the ears of one who was but fiftysix and by no means felt itand jerking his gloved hand towards ann he said  send down to the lodge gate for this  the voice of little ann answered loudly  no im coming back by myself  the car starting drowned discussion  lord valleys motoring somewhat pathetically illustrated the invasion of institutions by their destroyer science a supporter of the turf and not long since master of foxhounds most of whose soul outside politics was in horses he had been as it were compelled by common sense not only to tolerate but to take up and even press forward the cause of their supplanters his instinct of selfpreservation was secretly at work hurrying him to his own destruction forcing him to persuade himself that science and her successive victories over brute nature could be wooed into the service of a prestige which rested on a crystallized and stationary base all this keeping pace with the times this immersion in the results of modern discoveries this speedingup of existence so that it was all surface and little rootthe increasing volatility cosmopolitanism and even commercialism of his life on which he rather prided himself as a man of the worldwas with a secrecy too deep for his perception cutting at the aloofness logically demanded of one in his position stubborn and not spiritually subtle though by no means dull in practical matters he was resolutely letting the waters bear him on holding the tiller firmly without perceiving that he was in the vortex of a whirlpool indeed his common sense continually impelled him against the sort of reactionaryism of which his son miltoun had so much to that easier reactionaryism which living on its spiritual capital makes what material capital it can out of its enemy progress  he drove the car himself shrewd and selfcontained sitting easily with his cap well drawn over those steady eyes and though this unexpected meeting of the cabinet in the whitsuntide recess was not only a nuisance but gave food for anxiety he was fully able to enjoy the swift smooth movement through the summer air which met him with such friendly sweetness under the great trees of the long avenue beside him little ann was silent with her legs stuck out rather wide apart motoring was a new excitement for at home it was forbidden and a meditative rapture shone in her wide eyes above her sudden little nose only once she spoke when close to the lodge the car slowed down and they passed the lodgekeepers little daughter  hallo susie  there was no answer but the look on susies small pale face was so humble and adoring that lord valleys not a very observant man noticed it with a sort of satisfaction yes he thought somewhat irrelevantly the country is sound at heart     chapter ii  at ravensham house on the borders of richmond park suburban seat of the casterley family ever since it became usual to have a residence within easy driving distance of westminsterin a large conservatory adjoining the hall lady casterley stood in front of some japanese lilies she was a slender short old woman with an ivorycoloured face a thin nose and keen eyes halfveiled by delicate wrinkled lids very still in her grey dress and with grey hair she gave the impression of a little figure carved out of fine worn steel her firm spidery hand held a letter written in free somewhat sprawling style   monkland court  devon  my dear mother  geoffrey is motoring up tomorrow hell look in on you on the way if he can this new war scare has taken him up i shant be in town myself till miltouns election is over the fact is i darent leave him down here alone he sees his anonyma every day that mr courtier who wrote the book against warrather cool for a man whos been a soldier of fortune dont you thinkis staying at the inn working for the radical he knows her tooand one can only hope for miltouns sake too wellan attractive person with red moustaches rather nice and mad bertie has just come down i must get him to have a talk with miltoun and see if he cant find out how the land lies one can trust bertiehes really very astute i must say that shes quite a sweetlooking woman but absolutely nothings known of her here except that she divorced her husband how does one find out about people miltouns being so extraordinarily straitlaced makes it all the more awkward the earnestness of this rising generation is most remarkable i dont remember taking such a serious view of life in my youth  lady casterley lowered the coronetted sheet of paper the ghost of a grimace haunted her faceshe had not forgotten her daughters youth raising the letter again she read on  im sure geoffrey and i feel years younger than either miltoun or agatha though we did produce them one doesnt feel it with bertie or babs luckily the war scare is having an excellent effect on miltouns candidature claud harbinger is with us too working for miltoun but as a matter of fact i think hes after babs its rather melancholy when you think that babs isnt quite twentystill one cant expect anything else i suppose with her looks and claud is rather a fine specimen they talk of him a lot now hes quite coming to the fore among the young tories  lady casterley again lowered the letter and stood listening a prolonged muffled sound as of distant cheering and groans had penetrated the great conservatory vibrating among the pale petals of the lilies and setting free their scent in short waves of perfume she passed into the hall where stood an old man with sallow face and long white whiskers  what was that noise clifton  a posse of socialists my lady on their way to putney to hold a demonstration the people are hooting them theyve got blocked just outside the gates  are they making speeches  they are talking some kind of rant my lady  ill go and hear them give me my black stick  above the velvetdark flattoughed cedar trees which rose like pagodas of ebony on either side of the drive the sky hung lowering in one great purple cloud endowed with sinister life by a single white beam striking up into it from the horizon beneath this canopy of cloud a small phalanx of dusty dishevelledlooking men and women were drawn up in the road guarding and encouraging with cheers a tall blackcoated orator before and behind this phalanx a little mob of men and boys kept up an accompaniment of groans and jeering  lady casterley and her majordomo stood six paces inside the scrolled iron gates and watched the slight steelcoloured figure with steelcoloured hair was more arresting in its immobility than all the vociferations and gestures of the mob her eyes alone moved under their halfdrooped lids her right hand clutched tightly the handle of her stick the speakers voice rose in shrill protest against the exploitation of the people it sank in ironical comment on christianity it demanded passionately to be free from the continuous burden of this insensate militarist taxation it threatened that the people would take things info their own hands  lady casterley turned her head  he is talking nonsense clifton it is going to rain i shall go in  under the stone porch she paused the purple cloud had broken a blind fury of rain was deluging the fastscattering crowd a faint smile came on lady casterleys lips  it will do them good to have their ardour damped a little you will get wet cliftonhurry i expect lord valleys to dinner have a room got ready for him to dress hes motoring from monkland     chapter iii  in a very high whitepanelled room with but little furniture lord valleys greeted his motherinlaw respectfully  motored up in nine hours maamnot bad going  i am glad you came when is miltouns election  on the twentyninth  pity he should be away from monkland with thatanonymous woman living there  ah yes youve heard of her  lady casterley replied sharply  youre too easygoing geoffrey  lord valleys smiled  these war scares he said are getting a bore cant quite make out what the feeling of the country is about them  lady casterley rose  it has none when war comes the feeling will be all right it always is give me your arm are you hungry  when lord valleys spoke of war he spoke as one who since he arrived at years of discretion had lived within the circle of those who direct the destinies of states it was for himas for the lilies in the great glass houseimpossible to see with the eyes or feel with the feelings of a flower of the garden outside soaked in the best prejudices and manners of his class he lived a life no more shut off from the general than was to be expected indeed in some sort as a man of facts and common sense he was fairly in touch with the opinion of the average citizen he was quite genuine when he said that he believed he knew what the people wanted better than those who prated on the subject and no doubt he was right for temperamentally he was nearer to them than their own leaders though he would not perhaps have liked to be told so his manoftheworld political shrewdness had been superimposed by life on a nature whose prime strength was its practicality and lack of imagination it was his business to be efficient but not strenuous or desirous of pushing ideas to their logical conclusions to be neither narrow nor puritanical so long as the shell of good form was preserved intact to be a liberal landlord up to the point of not seriously damaging his interests to be welldisposed towards the arts until those arts revealed that which he had not before perceived it was his business to have light hands steady eyes iron nerves and those excellent manners that have no mannerisms it was his nature to be easygoing as a husband indulgent as a father careful and straightforward as a politician and as a man addicted to pleasure to work and to fresh air he admired and was fond of his wife and had never regretted his marriage he had never perhaps regretted anything unless it were that he had not yet won the derby or quite succeeded in getting his special strain of blueticked pointers to breed absolutely true to type his motherinlaw he respected as one might respect a principle  there was indeed in the personality of that little old lady the tremendous force of accumulated decisionthe inherited assurance of one whose prestige had never been questioned who from long immunity and a certain clearcut matteroffactness bred by the habit of command had indeed lost the power of perceiving that her prestige ever could be questioned her knowledge of her own mind was no ordinary piece of learning had not in fact been learned at all but sprang fullfledged from an active dominating temperament fortified by the necessity common to her class of knowing thoroughly the more patent side of public affairs armoured by the tradition of a culture demanded by leadership inspired by ideas but always the same ideas owning no master but in servitude to her own custom of leading she had a mind formidable as the twoedged swords wielded by her ancestors the fitzharolds at agincourt or poitiersa mind which had ever instinctively rejected that inner knowledge of herself or of the selves of others produced by those foolish practices of introspection contemplation and understanding so deleterious to authority if lord valleys was the body of the aristocratic machine lady casterley was the steel spring inside it all her life studiously unaffected and simple in attire of plain and frugal habit an early riser working at something or other from morning till night and as little wornout at seventyeight as most women of fifty she had only one weak spotand that was her strengthblindness as to the nature and size of her place in the scheme of things she was a type a force  wonderfully well she went with the room in which they were dining whose grey walls surmounted by a deep frieze painted somewhat in the style of fragonard contained many nymphs and roses now rather dim with the furniture too which had a look of having survived into times not its own on the tables were no flowers save five lilies in an old silver chalice and on the wall over the great sideboard a portrait of the late lord casterley  she spoke  i hope miltoun is taking his own line  thats the trouble he suffers from swollen principlesonly wish he could keep them out of his speeches  let him be and get him away from that woman as soon as his elections over what is her real name  mrs something lees noel  how long has she been there  about a year i think  and you dont know anything about her  lord valleys raised his shoulders  ah said lady casterley exactly youre letting the thing drift i shall go down myself i suppose gertrude can have me what has that mr courtier to do with this good lady  lord valleys smiled in this smile was the whole of his polite and easygoing philosophy i am no meddler it seemed to say and at sight of that smile lady casterley tightened her lips  he is a firebrand she said i read that book of his against warmost inflammatory aimed at grantand rosenstern chiefly ive just seen one of the results outside my own gates a mob of antiwar agitators  lord valleys controlled a yawn  really id no idea courtier had any influence  he is dangerous most idealists are negligiblehis book was clever  i wish to goodness we could see the last of these scares they only make both countries look foolish muttered lord valleys  lady casterley raised her glass full of a bloody red wine the war would save us she said  war is no joke  it would be the beginning of a better state of things  you think so  we should get the lead again as a nation and democracy would be put back fifty years  lord valleys made three little heaps of salt and paused to count them then with a slight uplifting of his eyebrows which seemed to doubt what he was going to say he murmured i should have said that we were all democrats nowadays what is it clifton  your chauffeur would like to know what time you will have the car  directly after dinner  twenty minutes later he was turning through the scrolled iron gates into the road for london it was falling dark and in the tremulous sky clouds were piled up and drifted here and there with a sort of endless lack of purpose no direction seemed to have been decreed unto their wings they had met together in the firmament like a flock of giant magpies crossing and recrossing each others flight the smell of rain was in the air the car raised no dust but bored swiftly on searching out the road with its lamps on putney bridge its march was stayed by a string of waggons lord valleys looked to right and left the river reflected the thousand lights of buildings piled along her sides lamps of the embankments lanterns of moored barges the sinuous pallid body of this great creature for ever gliding down to the sea roused in his mind no symbolic image he had had to do with her years back at the board of trade and knew her for what she was extremely dirty and getting abominably thin just where he would have liked her plump yet as he lighted a cigar there came to him a queer feelingas if he were in the presence of a woman he was fond of  i hope to god he thought nothingll come of these scares the car glided on into the long road swarming with traffic towards the fashionable heart of london outside stationers shops however the posters of evening papers were of no reassuring order                      the plot thickens                      more revelations                grave situation threatened  and before each poster could be seen a little eddy in the stream of the passersbyformed by persons glancing at the news and disengaging themselves to press on again the earl of valleys caught himself wondering what they thought of it what was passing behind those pale rounds of flesh turned towards the posters  did they think at all these men and women in the street what was their attitude towards this vaguely threatened cataclysm face after face stolid and apathetic expressed nothing no active desire certainly no enthusiasm hardly any dread poor devils the thing after all was no more within their control than it was within the power of ants to stop the ruination of their antheap by some passing boy it was no doubt quite true that the people had never had much voice in the making of war and the words of a radical weekly which as an impartial man he always forced himself to read recurred to him ignorant of the facts hypnotized by the words country and patriotism in the grip of mobinstinct and inborn prejudice against the foreigner helpless by reason of his patience stoicism good faith and confidence in those above him helpless by reason of his snobbery mutual distrust carelessness for the morrow and lack of public spiritin the face of war how impotent and to be pitied is the man in the street that paper though clever always seemed to him intolerably hifalutin  it was doubtful whether he would get to ascot this year and his mind flew for a moment to his promising twoyearold casetta then dashed almost violently as though in shame to the admiralty and the doubt whether they were fully alive to possibilities he himself occupied a softer spot of government one of those almost nominal offices necessary to qualify into the cabinet certain tried minds for whom no more strenuous post can for the moment be found from the admiralty again his thoughts leaped to his motherinlaw wonderful old woman what a statesman she would have made too reactionary deuce of a straight line she had taken about mrs lees noel and with a connoisseurs twinge of pleasure he recollected that ladys face and figure seen that morning as he passed her cottage mysterious or not the woman was certainly attractive very graceful head with its dark hair waved back from the middle over either templevery charming figure no lumber of any sort bouquet about her some story or other no doubtno affair of his always sorry for that sort of woman  a regiment of territorials returning from a march stayed the progress of his car he leaned forward watching them with much the same contained shrewd critical look he would have bent on a pack of hounds all the mistiness and speculation in his mind was gone now good stamp of man would give a capital account of themselves their faces flushed by a day in the open were masked with passivity or with a halfaggressive halfjocular selfconsciousness they were clearly not troubled by abstract doubts or any visions of the horrors of war  someone raised a cheer for the terriers lord valleys saw round him a little sea of hats rising and falling and heard a sound rather shrill and tentative swell into hoarse high clamour and suddenly die out seem keen enough he thought very little does it plenty of fighting spirit in the country and again a thrill of pleasure shot through him  then as the last soldier passed his car slowly forged its way through the straggling crowd pressing on behind the regimentmen of all ages youths a few women young girls who turned their eyes on him with a negligent stare as if their lives were too remote to permit them to take interest in this passing man at ease     chapter iv  at monkland that same hour in the little whitewashed withdrawingroom of a thatched whitewashed cottage two men sat talking one on either side of the hearth and in a low chair between them a darkeyed woman leaned back watching the tips of her delicate thin fingers pressed together or held out transparent towards the fire a log dropping now and then turned up its glowing underside and the firelight and the lamplight seemed so to have soaked into the white walls that a wan warmth exuded silvery dun moths fluttering in from the dark garden kept vibrating like spun shillings over a jadegreen bowl of crimson roses and there was a scent as ever in that old thatched cottage of woodsmoke flowers and sweetbriar  the man on the left was perhaps forty rather above middle height vigorous active straight with blue eyes and a sanguine face that glowed on small provocation his hair was very bright almost red and his fiery moustaches which descended to the level of his chin like don quixotes seemed bristling and charging  the man on the right was nearer thirty evidently tall wiry and very thin he sat rather crumpled in his low armchair with hands clasped round a knee and a little crucified smile haunted the lips of his lean face which with its parchmenty tanned shaven cheeks and deepset very living eyes had a certain beauty  these two men so extravagantly unlike looked at each other like neighbouring dogs who having long decided that they are better apart suddenly find that they have met at some spot where they cannot possibly have a fight and the woman watched the owner as it were of one but who from sheer love of dogs had always stroked and patted the other  so mr courtier said the younger man whose dry ironic voice like his smile seemed defending the fervid spirit in his eyes all you say only amounts you see to a defence of the socalled liberal spirit and forgive my candour that spirit being an importation from the realms of philosophy and art withers the moment it touches practical affairs  the man with the red moustaches laughed the sound was queerat once so genial and so sardonic  well put he said and far be it from me to gainsay but since compromise is the very essence of politics highpriests of caste and authority like you lord miltoun are every bit as much out of it as any liberal professor  i dont agree  agree or not your position towards public affairs is very like the churchs attitude towards marriage and divorce as remote from the realities of life as the attitude of the believer in free love and not more likely to catch on the death of your point of view lies in itselfits too driedup and far from things ever to understand them if you dont understand you can never rule you might just as well keep your hands in your pockets as go into politics with your notions  i fear we must continue to agree to differ  well perhaps i do pay you too high a compliment after all you are a patrician  you speak in riddles mr courtier  the darkeyed woman stirred her hands gave a sort of flutter as though in deprecation of acerbity  rising at once and speaking in a deferential voice the elder man said  were tiring mrs noel goodnight audrey its high time i was off against the darkness of the open french window he turned round to fire a parting shot  what i meant lord miltoun was that your class is the driest and most practical in the stateits odd if it doesnt save you from a poets dreams goodnight he passed out on to the lawn and vanished  the young man sat unmoving the glow of the fire had caught his face so that a spirit seemed clinging round his lips gleaming out of his eyes suddenly he said  do you believe that mrs noel  for answer audrey noel smiled then rose and went over to the window  look at my dear toad it comes here every evening on a flagstone of the verandah in the centre of the stream of lamplight sat a little golden toad as miltoun came to look it waddled to one side and vanished  how peaceful your garden is he said then taking her hand he very gently raised it to his lips and followed his opponent out into the darkness  truly peace brooded over that garden the night seemed listeningall lights out all hearts at rest it watched with a little white star for every tree and roof and slumbering tired flower as a mother watches her sleeping child leaning above him and counting with her love every hair of his head and all his tiny tremors  argument seemed childs babble indeed under the smile of night and the face of the woman left alone at her window was a little like the face of this warm sweet night it was sensitive harmonious and its harmony was not as in some faces coldbut seemed to tremble and glow and flutter as though it were a spirit which had found its place of resting  in her gardenall velvety grey with black shadows beneath the yewtrees the white flowers alone seemed to be awake and to look at her wistfully the trees stood dark and still not even the night birds stirred alone the little stream down in the bottom raised its voice privileged when day voices were hushed  it was not in audrey noel to deny herself to any spirit that was abroad to repel was an art she did not practise but this night though the spirit of peace hovered so near she did not seem to know it her hands trembled her cheeks were burning her breast heaved and sighs fluttered from her lips just parted     chapter v  eustace cardoc viscount miltoun had lived a very lonely life since he first began to understand the peculiarities of existence with the exception of clifton his grandmothers majordomo he made as a small child no intimate friend his nurses governesses tutors by their own confession did not understand him finding that he took himself with unnecessary seriousness a little afraid too of one whom they discovered to be capable of pushing things to the point of enduring pain in silence much of that early time was passed at ravensham for he had always been lady casterleys favourite grandchild she recognized in him the purposeful austerity which had somehow been omitted from the composition of her daughter but only to clifton then a man of fifty with a great gravity and long black whiskers did eustace relieve his soul i tell you this clifton he would say sitting on the sideboard or the arm of the big chair in cliftons room or wandering amongst the raspberries because you are my friend  and clifton with his head a little on one side and a sort of wise concern at his friends confidences which were sometimes of an embarrassing description would answer now and then of course my lord but more often of course my dear  there was in this friendship something fine and suitable neither of these friends taking or suffering liberties and both being interested in pigeons which they would stand watching with a remarkable attention  in course of time following the tradition of his family eustace went to harrow he was there five yearsalways one of those boys a little out at wrists and ankles who may be seen slouching solitary along the pavement to their own haunts rather dusty and with one shoulder slightly raised above the other from the habit of carrying something beneath one arm saved from being thought a smug by his title his lack of any conspicuous scholastic ability his obvious independence of what was thought of him and a sarcastic tongue which no one was eager to encounter he remained the ugly duckling who refused to paddle properly in the green ponds of public school tradition he played games so badly that in sheer selfdefence his fellows permitted him to play without them of fives they made an exception for in this he attained much proficiency owing to a certain windmilllike quality of limb he was noted too for daring chemical experiments of which he usually had one or two brewing surreptitiously at first and afterwards by special permission of his housemaster on the principle that if a room must smell it had better smell openly he made few friendships but these were lasting  his latin was so poor and his greek verse so vile that all had been surprised when towards the finish of his career he showed a very considerable power of writing and speaking his own language he left school without a pang but when in the train he saw the old hill and the old spire on the top of it fading away from him a lump rose in his throat he swallowed violently two or three times and thrusting himself far back into the carriage corner appeared to sleep  at oxford he was happier but still comparatively lonely remaining so long as custom permitted in lodgings outside his college and clinging thereafter to remote panelled rooms high up overlooking the gardens and a portion of the city wall it was at oxford that he first developed that passion for selfdiscipline which afterwards distinguished him he took up rowing and though thoroughly unsuited by nature to this pastime secured himself a place in his college torpid at the end of a race he was usually supported from his stretcher in a state of extreme extenuation due to having pulled the last quarter of the course entirely with his spirit the same craving for selfdiscipline guided him in the choice of schools he went out in greats for which owing to his indifferent mastery of greek and latin he was the least fitted with enormous labour he took a very good degree he carried off besides the highest distinctions of the university for english essays the ordinary circles of college life knew nothing of him not once in the whole course of his university career was he the better for wine he did not hunt he never talked of women and none talked of women in his presence but now and then he was visited by those gusts which come to the ascetic when all life seemed suddenly caught up and devoured by a flame burning night and day and going out mercifully he knew not why like a blown candle however unsocial in the proper sense of the word he by no means lacked company in these oxford days he knew many both dons and undergraduates his long stride and determined absence of direction had severely tried all those who could stomach so slow a pastime as walking for the sake of talking the country knew himthough he never knew the countryfrom abingdon to bablock hythe his name stood high too at the union where he made his mark during his first term in a debate on a censorship of literature which he advocated with gloom pertinacity and a certain youthful brilliance that might well have carried the day had not an irishman got up and pointed out the danger hanging over the old testament to that he had retorted better sir it should run a risk than have no risk to run from which moment he was notable  he stayed up four years and went down with a sense of bewilderment and loss the matured verdict of oxford on this child of hers was eustace miltoun ah queer bird will make his mark  he had about this time an interview with his father which confirmed the impression each had formed of the other it took place in the library at monkland court on a late november afternoon  the light of eight candles in thin silver candlesticks four on either side of the carved stone hearth illumined that room their gentle radiance penetrated but a little way into the great dark space lined with books panelled and floored with black oak where the acrid fragrance of leather and dried roseleaves seemed to drench the very soul with the aroma of the past above the huge fireplace with light falling on one side of his shaven face hung a portraitpainter unknownof that cardinal caradoc who suffered for his faith in the sixteenth century ascetic crucified with a little smile clinging to the lips and deepset eyes he presided above the bluefish flames of a log fire  father and son found some difficulty in beginning  each of those two felt as though he were in the presence of someone elses very near relation they had in fact seen extremely little of each other and not seen that little long  lord valleys uttered the first remark  well my dear fellow what are you going to do now i think we can make certain of this seat down here if you like to stand  miltoun had answered thanks very much i dont think so at present  through the thin fume of his cigar lord valleys watched that long figure sunk deep in the chair opposite  why not he said you cant begin too soon unless you think you ought to go round the world  before i can become a man of it  lord valleys gave a rather disconcerted laugh  theres nothing in politics you cant pick up as you go along he said how old are you  twentyfour  you look older a faint line as of contemplation rose between his eyes was it fancy that a little smile was hovering about miltouns lips  ive got a foolish theory came from those lips that one must know the conditions first i want to give at least five years to that  lord valleys raised his eyebrows waste of time he said youd know more at the end of it if you went into the house at once you take the matter too seriously  no doubt  for fully a minute lord valleys made no answer he felt almost ruffled waiting till the sensation had passed he said well my dear fellow as you please  miltouns apprenticeship to the profession of politics was served in a slum settlement on his fathers estates in chambers at the temple in expeditions to germany america and the british colonies in work at elections and in two forlorn hopes to capture a constituency which could be trusted not to change its principles he read much slowly but with conscientious tenacity poetry history and works on philosophy religion and social matters  fiction and especially foreign fiction he did not care for with the utmost desire to be wide and impartial he sucked in what ministered to the wants of his nature rejecting unconsciously all that by its unsuitability endangered the flame of his private spirit what he read in fact served only to strengthen those profounder convictions which arose from his temperament with a contempt of the vulgar gewgaws of wealth and rank he combined a humble but intense and growing conviction of his capacity for leadership of a spiritual superiority to those whom he desired to benefit there was no trace indeed of the common pharisee in miltoun he was simple and direct but his eyes his gestures the whole man proclaimed the presence of some secret spring of certainty some fundamental well into which no disturbing glimmers penetrated he was not devoid of wit but he was devoid of that kind of wit which turns its eyes inward and sees something of the fun that lies in being what you are miltoun saw the world and all the things thereof shaped like spireseven when they were circles he seemed to have no sense that the universe was equally compounded of those two symbols whose point of reconciliation had not yet been discovered  such was he then when the member for his native division was made a peer  he had reached the age of thirty without ever having been in love leading a life of almost savage purity with one solitary breakdown women were afraid of him and he was perhaps a little afraid of woman she was in theory too lovely and desirablethe halfmoon in a summer sky in practice too cloying or too harsh he had an affection for barbara his younger sister but to his mother his grandmother or his elder sister agatha he had never felt close it was indeed amusing to see lady valleys with her firstborn her fine figure the blown roses of her face her greyblue eyes which had a slight tendency to roll as though amusement just touched with naughtiness bubbled behind them were reduced to a queer satirical decorum in miltouns presence thoughts and sayings verging on the risky were characteristic of her robust physique of her soul which could afford to express almost all that occurred to it miltoun had never not even as a child given her his confidence she bore him no resentment being of that large generous build in body and mind rarelynever in her classassociated with the capacity for feeling aggrieved or lowered in any estimation even its own he was and always had been an odd boy and there was an end of it nothing had perhaps so disconcerted lady valleys as his want of behaviour in regard to women she felt it abnormal just as she recognized the essential if duly veiled normality of her husband and younger son it was this feeling which made her realize almost more vividly than she had time for in the whirl of politics and fashion the danger of his friendship with this lady to whom she alluded so discreetly as anonyma  pure chance had been responsible for the inception of that friendship going one december afternoon to the farmhouse of a tenant just killed by a fall from his horse miltoun had found the widow in a state of bewildered grief thinly cloaked in the manner of one who had almost lost the power to express her feelings and quite lost it in presence of the gentry having assured the poor soul that she need have no fear about her tenancy he was just leaving when he met in the stoneflagged entrance a lady in a fur cap and jacket carrying in her arms a little crying boy bleeding from a cut on the forehead taking him from her and placing him on a table in the parlour miltoun looked at this lady and saw that she was extremely grave and soft and charming he inquired of her whether the mother should be told  she shook her head  poor thing not just now lets wash it and bind it up first  together therefore they washed and bound up the cut having finished she looked at miltoun and seemed to say you would do the telling so much better than i  he therefore told the mother and was rewarded by a little smile from the grave lady  from that meeting he took away the knowledge of her name audrey lees noel and the remembrance of a face whose beauty under a cap of squirrels fur pursued him some days later passing by the village green he saw her entering a garden gate on this occasion he had asked her whether she would like her cottage rethatched an inspection of the roof had followed he had stayed talking a long time accustomed to womenover the best of whom for all their grace and lack of affectation highcaste life had wrapped the manner which seems to take all things for grantedthere was a peculiar charm for miltoun in this soft darkeyed lady who evidently lived quite out of the world and had so poignant and shy a flavour thus from a chance seed had blossomed swiftly one of those rare friendships between lonely people which can in short time fill great spaces of two lives  one day she asked him you know about me i suppose miltoun made a motion of his head signifying that he did his informant had been the vicar  yes i am told her story is a sad onea divorce  do you mean that she has been divorced or  for the fraction of a second the vicar perhaps had hesitated  oh nono sinned against i am sure a nice woman so far as i have seen though im afraid not one of my congregation  with this miltoun in whom chivalry had already been awakened was content when she asked if he knew her story he would not for the world have had her rake up what was painful whatever that story she could not have been to blame she had begun already to be shaped by his own spirit had become not a human being as it was but an expression of his aspiration  on the third evening after his passage of arms with courtier he was again at her little white cottage sheltering within its high garden walls smothered in roses and with a blackbrown thatch overhanging the oldfashioned leaded panes of the upper windows it had an air of hiding from the world behind as though on guard two pine trees spread their dark boughs over the outhouses and in any southwest wind could be heard speaking gravely about the weather tall lilac bushes flanked the garden and a huge limetree in the adjoining field sighed and rustled or on still days let forth the drowsy hum of countless small dusky bees who frequented that green hostelry  he found her altering a dress sitting over it in her peculiar delicate fashionas if all objects whatsoever dresses flowers books music required from her the same sympathy  he had come from a long days electioneering had been heckled at two meetings and was still sore from the experience to watch her to be soothed and ministered to by her had never been so restful and stretched out in a long chair he listened to her playing  over the hill a pierrot moon was slowly moving up in a sky the colour of grey irises and in a sort of trance miltoun stared at the burntout star travelling in bright pallor  across the moor a sea of shallow mist was rolling and the trees in the valley like browsing cattle stood kneedeep in whiteness with all the air above them wan from an innumerable rain as of moondust falling into that white sea then the moon passed behind the limetree so that a great lighted chinese lantern seemed to hang blueblack from the sky  suddenly jarring and shivering the music came a sound of hooting it swelled died away and swelled again  miltoun rose  that has spoiled my vision he said mrs noel i have something i want to say but looking down at her sitting so still with her hands resting on the keys he was silent in sheer adoration  a voice from the door ejaculated  oh maamoh my lord theyre devilling a gentleman on the green     chapter vi  when the immortal don set out to ring all the bells of merriment he was followed by one clown charles courtier on the other hand had always been accompanied by thousands who really could not understand the conduct of this man with no commercial sense but though he puzzled his contemporaries they did not exactly laugh at him because it was reported that he had really killed some men and loved some women they found such a combination irresistible when coupled with an appearance both vigorous and gallant the son of an oxfordshire clergyman and mounted on a lost cause he had been riding through the world ever since he was eighteen without once getting out of the saddle the secret of this endurance lay perhaps in his unconsciousness that he was in the saddle at all it was as much his natural seat as office stools to other mortals he made no capital out of errantry his temperament being far too like his redgold hair which people compared to flames consuming all before them his vices were patent too incurable an optimism an admiration for beauty such as must sometimes have caused him to forget which woman he was most in love with too thin a skin too hot a heart hatred of humbug and habitual neglect of his own interest unmarried and with many friends and many enemies he kept his body like a swordblade and his soul always at white heat  that one who admitted to having taken part in five wars should be mixing in a byelection in the cause of peace was not so inconsistent as might be supposed for he had always fought on the losing side and there seemed to him at the moment no side so losing as that of peace no great politician he was not an orator nor even a glib talker yet a quiet mordancy of tongue and the whitehot look in his eyes never failed to make an impression of some kind on an audience  there was however hardly a corner of england where orations on behalf of peace had a poorer chance than the bucklandbury division to say that courtier had made himself unpopular with its matteroffact independent stolid yet quicktempered population would be inadequate he had outraged their beliefs and roused the most profound suspicions they could not for the life of them make out what he was at though by his adventures and his book peacea lost cause he was in london a conspicuous figure they had naturally never heard of him and his adventure to these parts seemed to them an almost ludicrous example of pure idea poking its nose into plain factsthe idea that nations ought to and could live in peace being so very pure and the fact that they never had so very plain  at monkland which was all court estate there were naturally but few supporters of miltouns opponent mr humphrey chilcox and the reception accorded to the champion of peace soon passed from curiosity to derision from derision to menace till courtiers attitude became so defiant and his sentences so heated that he was only saved from a rough handling by the influential interposition of the vicar  yet when he began to address them he had felt irresistibly attracted they looked such capital independent fellows waiting for his turn to speak he had marked them down as men after his own heart for though courtier knew that against an unpopular idea there must always be a majority he never thought so ill of any individual as to suppose him capable of belonging to that illomened body  surely these fine independent fellows were not to be hoodwinked by the jingoes it had been one more disillusion he had not taken it lying down neither had his audience they dispersed without forgiving they came together again without having forgotten  the village inn a little white building whose small windows were overgrown with creepers had a single guests bedroom on the upper floor and a little sittingroom where courtier took his meals the rest of the house was but stonefloored bar with a long wooden bench against the back wall whence nightly a stream of talk would issue all harsh as and sudden soft us whence too a figure a little unsteady would now and again emerge to a chorus of gude naights stand still under the ashtrees to light his pipe then move slowly home  but on that evening when the trees like cattle stood kneedeep in the moondust those who came out from the barroom did not go away they hung about in the shadows and were joined by other figures creeping furtively through the bright moonlight from behind the inn presently more figures moved up from the lanes and the churchyard path till thirty or more were huddled there and their stealthy murmur of talk distilled a rare savour of illicit joy unholy hilarity indeed seemed lurking in the deep treeshadow before the wan inn whence from a single lighted window came forth the halfchanting sound of a mans voice reading out loud laughter was smothered talk whispered  hem apractisin his spaches smoke the cunnin old vox out red peppers the proper stuff see men sneeze weve ascreed up the door  then as a face showed at the lighted window a burst of harsh laughter broke the hush  he at the window was seen struggling violently to wrench away a bar the laughter swelled to hooting the prisoner forced his way through dropped to the ground rose staggered and fell  a voice said sharply  whats this  out of the sounds of scuffling and scattering came the whisper his lordship and the shade under the ashtrees became deserted save by the tall dark figure of a man and a womans white shape  is that you mr courtier are you hurt  a chuckle rose from the recumbent figure  only my knee the beggars they precious nearly choked me though     chapter vii  bertie caradoc leaving the smokingroom at monkland court that same eveningon his way to bed went to the georgian corridor where his pet barometer was hanging to look at the glass had become the nightly habit of one who gave all the time he could spare from his profession to hunting in the winter and to racing in the summer  the hon hubert caradoc an apprentice to the calling of diplomacy more completely than any living caradoc embodied the characteristic strength and weaknesses of that family he was of fair height and wiry build his weathered face under sleek dark hair had regular rather small features and wore an expression of alert resolution masked by impassivity over his inquiring hazelgrey eyes the lids were almost religiously kept half drawn he had been born reticent and great indeed was the emotion under which he suffered when the whole of his eyes were visible his nose was finely chiselled and had little flesh his lips covered by a small dark moustache scarcely opened to emit his speeches which were uttered in a voice singularly muffled yet unexpectedly quick the whole personality was that of a man practical spirited guarded resourceful with great power of selfcontrol who looked at life as if she were a horse under him to whom he must give way just so far as was necessary to keep mastery of her a man to whom ideas were of no value except when wedded to immediate action essentially neat demanding to be done well but capable of stoicism if necessary urbane yet always in readiness to thrust able only to condone the failings and to compassionate the kinds of distress which his own experience had taught him to understand such was miltouns younger brother at the age of twentysix  having noted that the glass was steady he was about to seek the stairway when he saw at the farther end of the entrancehall three figures advancing arminarm habitually both curious and wary he waited till they came within the radius of a lamp then seeing them to be those of miltoun and a footman supporting between them a lame man he at once hastened forward  have you put your knee out sir hold on a minute get a chair charles  seating the stranger in this chair bertie rolled up the trouser and passed his fingers round the knee there was a sort of lovingkindness in that movement as of a hand which had in its time felt the joints and sinews of innumerable horses  hm he said can you stand a bit of a jerk catch hold of him behind eustace sit down on the floor charles and hold the legs of the chair now then and taking up the foot he pulled there was a click a little noise of teeth ground together and bertie said good manshant have to have the vet to you this time  having conducted their lame guest to a room in the georgian corridor hastily converted to a bedroom the two brothers presently left him to the attentions of the footman  well old man said bertie as they sought their rooms thats put paid to his namewont do you any more harm this journey good plucked one though  the report that courtier was harboured beneath their roof went the round of the family before breakfast through the agency of one whose practice it was to know all things and to see that others partook of that knowledge little ann paying her customary morning visit to her mothers room took her stand with face turned up and hands clasping her belt and began at once  uncle eustace brought a man last night with a wounded leg and uncle bertie pulled it out straight william says that charles says he only made a noise like thisthere was a faint sound of small chumping teeth and hes the man thats staying at the inn and the stairs were too narrow to carry him up william says and if his knee was put out he wont be able to walk without a stick for a long time can i go to father  agatha who was having her hair brushed thought  im not sure whether belts so low as that are wholesome murmured  wait a minute  but little ann was gone and her voice could be heard in the dressingroom climbing up towards sir william who from the sound of his replies was manifestly shaving when agatha who never could resist a legitimate opportunity of approaching her husband looked in he was alone and rather thoughtfula tall man with a solid steady face and cautious eyes not in truth remarkable except to his own wife  that fellow courtiers caught by the leg he said dont know what your mother will say to an enemy in the camp  isnt he a freethinker and rather  sir william following his own thoughts interrupted  just as well of course so far as miltouns concerned to have got him here  agatha sighed well i suppose we shall have to be nice to him ill tell mother  sir william smiled  ann will see to that he said  ann was seeing to that  seated in the embrasure of the window behind the lookingglass where lady valleys was still occupied she was saying  he fell out of the window because of the red pepper miss wallace says he is a hostagewhat does hostage mean granny  when six years ago that word had first fallen on lady valleys ears she had thought oh dear am i really granny it had been a shock had seemed the end of so much but the matteroffact heroism of women so much quicker to accept the inevitable than men had soon come to her aid and now unlike her husband she did not care a bit for all that she answered nothing partly because it was not necessary to speak in order to sustain a conversation with little ann and partly because she was deep in thought  the man was injured hospitality of courseespecially since their own tenants had committed the outrage still to welcome a man who had gone out of his way to come down here and stump the country against her own son was rather a tall order it might have been worse no doubt if for instance he had been some impossible nonconformist radical this mr courtier was a free lancerather a wellknown man an interesting creature she must see that he felt at home and comfortable if he were pumped judiciously no doubt one could find out about this woman moreover the acceptance of their salt would silence him politically if she knew anything of that type of man who always had something in him of the arabs creed her mind that of a capable administrator took in all the practical significance of this incident which although untoward was not without its comic side to one disposed to find zest and humour in everything that did not absolutely run counter to her interests and philosophy  the voice of little ann broke in on her reflections  im going to auntie babs now  very well give me a kiss first  little ann thrust up her face so that its sudden little nose penetrated lady valleys soft curving lips  when early that same afternoon courtier leaning on a stick passed from his room out on to the terrace he was confronted by three sunlit peacocks marching slowly across a lawn towards a statue of diana with incredible dignity those birds moved as if never in their lives had they been hurried they seemed indeed to know that when they got there there would be nothing for them to do but to come back again beyond them through the tall trees over some wooded foothills of the moorland and a promised land of pinkish fields pasture and orchards the prospect stretched to the far sea heat clothed this view with a kind of opalescence a fairy garment transmuting all values so that the four square walls and tall chimneys of the potteryworks a few miles down the valley seemed to courtier like a vision of some old fortified italian town his sensations finding himself in this galley were peculiar for his feeling towards miltoun whom he had twice met at mrs noels was in spite of disagreements by no means unfriendly while his feeling towards miltouns family was not yet in existence having lived from hand to mouth and in many countries since he left westminster school he had now practically no class feelings an attitude of hostility to aristocracy because it was aristocracy was as incomprehensible to him as an attitude of deference  his sensations habitually shaped themselves in accordance with those two permanent requirements of his nature liking for adventure and hatred of tyranny the labourer who beat his wife the shopman who sweated his hands the parson who consigned his parishioners to hell the peer who rode roughshodall were equally odious to him he thought of people as individuals and it was as it were by accident that he had conceived the class generalization which he had fired back at miltoun from mrs noels window sanguine accustomed to queer environments and always catching at the moment as it flew he had not to fight with the timidities and irritations of a nervous temperament his cheery courtesy was only disturbed when he became conscious of some sentiment which appeared to him mean or cowardly on such occasions not perhaps infrequent his face looked as if his heart were physically fuming and since his shell of stoicism was never quite melted by this heat a very peculiar expression was the result a sort of calm sardonic desperate jolly look  his chief feeling then at the outrage which had laid him captive in the enemys camp was one of vague amusement and curiosity people round about spoke fairly well of this caradoc family there did not seem to be any lack of kindly feeling between them and their tenants there was said to be no griping destitution nor any particular illhousing on their estate and if the inhabitants were not encouraged to improve themselves they were at all events maintained at a certain level by steady and not ungenerous supervision when a roof required thatching it was thatched when a man became too old to work he was not suffered to lapse into the workhouse in bad years for wool or beasts or crops the farmers received a graduated remission of rent the potteryworks were run on a liberal if autocratic basis it was true that though lord valleys was said to be a staunch supporter of a back to the land policy no disposition was shown to encourage people to settle on these particular lands no doubt from a feeling that such settlers would not do them so much justice as their present owner indeed so firmly did this conviction seemingly obtain that lord valleys agent was not unfrequently observed to be buying a little bit more  but since in this life one notices only what interests him all this gossip half complimentary half not had fallen but lightly on the ears of the champion of peace during his campaign for he was as has been said but a poor politician and rode his own horse very much his own way  while he stood there enjoying the view he heard a small high voice and became conscious of a little girl in a very shady hat so far back on her brown hair that it did not shade her and of a small hand put out in front he took the hand and answered  thank you i am welland you perceiving the while that a pair of wide frank eyes were examining his leg  does it hurt  not to speak of  my ponys leg was blistered granny is coming to look at it  i see  i have to go now i hope youll soon be better goodbye  then instead of the little girl courtier saw a tall and rather florid woman regarding him with a sort of quizzical dignity she wore a stiffish fawncoloured dress that seemed to be cut a little too tight round her substantial hips for it quite neglected to embrace her knees she had on no hat no gloves no ornaments except the rings on her fingers and a little jewelled watch in a leather bracelet on her wrist there was indeed about her whole figure an air of almost professional escape from finery  stretching out a wellshaped but not small hand she said  i most heartily apologize to you mr courtier  not at all  i do hope youre comfortable have they given you everything you want  more than everything  it really was disgraceful however its brought us the pleasure of making your acquaintance ive read your book of course  to courtier it seemed that on this ladys face had come a look which seemed to say yes very clever and amusing quite enjoyable but the ideaswhat you know very well they wont doin fact they mustnt do  thats very nice of you  but into lady valleys answer i dont agree with it a bit you know there had crept a touch of asperity as though she knew that he had smiled inside what we want preached in these days are the warlike virtuesespecially by a warrior  believe me lady valleys the warlike virtues are best left to men of more virgin imagination  he received a quick look and the words anyway im sure you dont care a rap for politics you know mrs lees noel dont you what a pretty woman she is  but as she spoke courtier saw a young girl coming along the terrace she had evidently been riding for she wore high boots and a skirt which had enabled her to sit astride her eyes were blue and her hairthe colour of beechleaves in autumn with the sun shining throughwas coiled up tight under a small soft hat she was tall and moved towards them like one endowed with great length from the hip joint to the knee joy of life serene unconscious vigour seemed to radiate from her whole face and figure  at lady valleys words  ah babs my daughter barbaramr courtier he put out his hand received within it some gauntleted fingers held out with a smile and heard her say  miltouns gone up to town mother i was going to motor in to bucklandbury with a message he gave me so i can fetch granny out from the station  you had better take ann or shell make our lives a burden and perhaps mr courtier would like an airing is your knee fit do you think  glancing at the apparition courtier replied  it is  never since the age of seven had he been able to look on feminine beauty without a sense of warmth and faint excitement and seeing now perhaps the most beautiful girl he had ever beheld he desired to be with her wherever she might be going there was too something very fascinating in the way she smiled as if she had a little seen through his sentiments  well then she said wed better look for ann  after short but vigorous search little ann was foundin the car instinct having told her of a forward movement in which it was her duty to take part and soon they had started ann between them in that peculiar state of silence to which she became liable when really interested  from the monkland estate flowered lawned and timbered to the open moor was like passing to another world for no sooner was the last lodge of the western drive left behind than there came into sudden view the most pagan bit of landscape in all england in this wild parliamenthouse clouds rocks sun and winds met and consulted the old men too had left their spirits among the great stones which lay couched like lions on the hilltops under the white clouds and their brethren the hunting buzzard hawks here the very rocks were restless changing form and sense and colour from day to day as though worshipping the unexpected and refusing themselves to law the winds too in their passage revolted against their courses and came tearing down wherever there were combes or crannies so that men in their shelters might still learn the power of the wild gods  the wonders of this prospect were entirely lost on little ann and somewhat so on courtier deeply engaged in reconciling those two alien principles courtesy and the love of looking at a pretty face he was wondering too what this girl of twenty who had the selfpossession of a woman of forty might be thinking it was little ann who broke the silence  auntie babs it wasnt a very strong house was it  courtier looked in the direction of her small finger there was the wreck of a little house which stood close to a stone man who had obviously possessed that hill before there were men of flesh over one corner of the sorry ruin a single patch of roof still clung but the rest was open  he was a silly man to build it wasnt he ann thats why they call it ashmans folly  is he alive  not quiteits just a hundred years ago  what made him build it here  he hated women andthe roof fell in on him  why did he hate women  he was a crank  what is a crank  ask mr courtier  under this girls calm quizzical glance courtier endeavoured to find an answer to that question  a crank he said slowly is a man like me  he heard a little laugh and became acutely conscious of anns dispassionate examining eyes  is uncle eustace a crank  you know now mr courtier what ann thinks of you you think a good deal of uncle eustace dont you ann  yes said ann and fixed her eyes before her but courtier gazed sidewaysover her hatless head  his exhilaration was increasing every moment this girl reminded him of a twoyearold filly he had once seen stepping out of ascot paddock for her first race with the sun glistening on her satin chestnut skin her neck held high her eyes all fireas sure to win as that grass was green it was difficult to believe her miltouns sister it was difficult to believe any of those four young caradocs related the grave ascetic miltoun wrapped in the garment of his spirit mild domestic straitlaced agatha bertie muffled shrewd and steely and this frank joyful conquering barbarathe range was wide  but the car had left the moor and down a steep hill was passing the small villas and little grey workmens houses outside the town of bucklandbury  ann and i have to go on to miltouns headquarters shall i drop you at the enemys mr courtier stop please frith  and before courtier could assent they had pulled up at a house on which was inscribed with extraordinary vigour chilcox for bucklandbury  hobbling into the committeeroom of mr humphrey chilcox which smelled of paint courtier took with him the scented memory of youth and ambergris and harris tweed  in that room three men were assembled round a table the eldest of whom endowed with little grey eyes a stubbly beard and that mysterious something only found in those who have been mayors rose at once and came towards him  mr courtier i believe he said bluffly glad to see you sir most distressed to hear of this outrage though in a way its done us good yes really grossly against fair play shouldnt be surprised if it turned a couple of hundred votes you carry the effects of it about with you i see  a thin refined man with wiry hair also came up holding a newspaper in his hand  it has had one rather embarrassing effect he said read this            outrage on a distinguished visitor            lord miltouns evening adventure  courtier read a paragraph  the man with the little eyes broke the ominous silence which ensued  one of our side must have seen the whole thing jumped on his bicycle and brought in the account before they went to press they make no imputation on the ladysimply state the facts quite enough he added with impersonal grimness i think hes done for himself sir  the man with the refined face added nervously  we couldnt help it mr courtier i really dont know what we can do i dont like it a bit  has your candidate seen this courtier asked  cant have struck in the third committeeman we hadnt seen it ourselves until an hour ago  i should never have permitted it said the man with the refined face i blame the editor greatly  come to that said the littleeyed man its a plain piece of news if it makes a stir thats not our fault the paper imputes nothing it states position of the lady happens to do the rest cant help it and moreover sir speaking for self dont want to well have no loose morals in public life down here please god there was real feeling in his words then catching sight of courtiers face he added do you know this lady  ever since she was a child anyone who speaks evil of her has to reckon with me  the man with the refined face said earnestly  believe me mr courtier i entirely sympathize we had nothing to do with the paragraph its one of those incidents where one benefits against ones will most unfortunate that she came out on to the green with lord miltoun you know what people are  its the headline that does it said the third committeeman theyve put what will attract the public  i dont know i dont know said the littleeyed man stubbornly if lord miltoun will spend his evenings with lonely ladies he cant blame anybody but himself  courtier looked from face to face  this closes my connection with the campaign he said whats the address of this paper and without waiting for an answer he took up the journal and hobbled from the room he stood a minute outside finding the address then made his way down the street     chapter viii  by the side of little ann barbara sat leaning back amongst the cushions of the car in spite of being already launched into highcaste life which brings with it an early knowledge of the world she had still some of the eagerness in her face which makes children lovable yet she looked negligently enough at the citizens of bucklandbury being already a little conscious of the strange mixture of sentiment peculiar to her countrymen in presence of herselfthat curious expression on their faces resulting from the continual attempt to look down their noses while slanting their eyes upwards yes she was already alive to that mysterious glance which had built the national house and insured it afterwardsfoe to cynicism pessimism and anything french or russian parent of all the national virtues and all the national vices of idealism and muddleheadedness of independence and servility fosterer of conduct murderer of speculation looking up and looking down but never straight at anything most high most deep most queer and ever bubblingup from the essential well of emulation  surrounded by that glance waiting for courtier barbara not less british than her neighbours was secretly slanting her own eyes up and down over the absent figure of her new acquaintance she too wanted something she could look up to and at the same time see damned first and in this knighterrant it seemed to her that she had got it  he was a creature from another world she had met many men but not as yet one quite of this sort it was rather nice to be with a clever man who had none the less done so many outdoor things been through so many bodily adventures the mere writers or even the bohemians whom she occasionally met were after all only chaplains to the court necessary to keep aristocracy in touch with the latest developments of literature and art but this mr courtier was a man of action he could not be looked on with the amused admiring toleration suited to men remarkable only for ideas and the way they put them into paint or ink he had used and could use the sword even in the cause of peace he could love had loved or so they said if barbara had been a girl of twenty in another class she would probably never have heard of this and if she had heard it might very well have dismayed or shocked her but she had heard and without shock because she had already learned that men were like that and women too sometimes  it was with quite a little pang of concern that she saw him hobbling down the street towards her and when he was once more seated she told the chauffeur to the station frith quick please and began  you are not to be trusted a bit what were you doing  but courtier smiled grimly over the head of ann in silence  at this almost the first time she had ever yet encountered a distinct rebuff barbara quivered as though she had been touched lightly with a whip her lips closed firmly her eyes began to dance very well my dear she thought but presently stealing a look at him she became aware of such a queer expression on his face that she forgot she was offended  is anything wrong mr courtier  yes lady barbara something is very wrongthat miserable mean thing the human tongue  barbara had an intuitive knowledge of how to handle things a kind of moral sangfroid drawn in from the faces she had watched the talk she had heard from her youth up she trusted those intuitions and letting her eyes conspire with his over anns brown hair she said  anything to do with mrs n seeing yes in his eyes she added quickly and m  courtier nodded  i thought that was coming let them babble who cares  she caught an approving glance and the word good  but the car had drawn up at bucklandbury station  the little grey figure of lady casterley coming out of the station doorway showed but slight sign of her long travel she stopped to take the car in from chauffeur to courtier  well frithmr courtier is it i know your book and i dont approve of you youre a dangerous manhow do you do i must have those two bags the cart can bring the rest randle get up in front and dont get dusty ann but ann was already beside the chauffeur having long planned this improvement hm so youve hurt your leg sir keep still we can sit three now my dear i can kiss you youve grown  lady casterleys kiss once received was never forgotten neither perhaps was barbaras yet they were different for in the case of lady casterley the old eyes bright and investigating could be seen deciding the exact spot for the lips to touch then the face with its firm chin was darted forward the lips paused a second as though to make quite certain then suddenly dug hard and dry into the middle of the cheek quavered for the fraction of a second as if trying to remember to be soft and were relaxed like the elastic of a catapult and in the case of barbara first a sort of light came into her eyes then her chin tilted a little then her lips pouted a little her body quivered as if it were getting a size larger her hair breathed there was a small sweet sound it was over  thus kissing her grandmother barbara resumed her seat and looked at courtier sitting three as they were he was touching her and it seemed to her somehow that he did not mind  the wind had risen blowing from the west and sunshine was flying on it the call of the cuckoosa little sharpenedfollowed the swifttravelling car and that essential sweetness of the moor born of the heather roots and the southwest wind was stealing out from under the young ferns  with her thin nostrils distended to this scent lady casterley bore a distinct resemblance to a small fine gamebird  you smell nice down here she said now mr courtier before i forgetwho is this mrs lees noel that i hear so much of  at that question barbara could not help sliding her eyes round how would he stand up to granny it was the moment to see what he was made of granny was terrific  a very charming woman lady casterley  no doubt but i am tired of hearing that what is her story  has she one  ha said lady casterley  ever so slightly barbara let her arm press against courtiers it was so delicious to hear granny getting no forwarder  i may take it she has a past then  not from me lady casterley  again barbara gave him that imperceptible and flattering touch  well this is all very mysterious i shall find out for myself you know her my dear you must take me to see her  dear granny if people hadnt pasts they wouldnt have futures  lady casterley let her little clawlike hand descend on her granddaughters thigh  dont talk nonsense and dont stretch like that she said youre too large already  at dinner that night they were all in possession of the news sir william had been informed by the local agent at staverton where lord harbingers speech had suffered from some rude interruptions the hon geoffrey winlow having sent his wife on had flown over in his biplane from winkleigh and brought a copy of the rag with him the one member of the small houseparty who had not heard the report before dinner was lord dennis fitzharold lady casterleys brother  little of course was said but after the ladies had withdrawn harbinger with that plainspoken spontaneity which was so unexpected perhaps a little intentionally so in connection with his almost classically formed face uttered words to the effect that if they did not fundamentally kick that rumour it was all up with miltoun really this was serious and the beggars knew it and they were going to work it and miltoun had gone up to town no one knew what for it was the devil of a mess  in all the conversation of this young man there was that peculiar brand of voice which seems ever rebutting an accusation of being seriousa brand of voice and manner warranted against anything save ridicule and in the face of ridicule apt to disappear the words just a little satirically spoken what is my dear young man stopped him at once  looking for the complement and counterpart of lady casterley one would perhaps have singled out her brother all her abrupt decision was negated in his profound ironical urbanity his voice and look and manner were like his velvet coat which had here and there a whitish sheen as if it had been touched by moonlight his hair too had that sheen his very delicate features were framed in a white beard and moustache of elizabethan shape his eyes hazel and still clear looked out very straight with a certain dry kindliness his face though unweathered and unseamed and much too fine and thin in texture had a curious affinity to the faces of old sailors or fishermen who have lived a simple practical life in the light of an overmastering tradition it was the face of a man with a very set creed and inclined to be satiric towards innovations examined by him and rejected full fifty years ago one felt that a brain not devoid either of subtlety or aesthetic quality had long given up all attempts to interfere with conduct that all shrewdness of speculation had given place to shrewdness of practical judgment based on very definite experience owing to lack of advertising power natural to one so conscious of his dignity as to have lost all care for it and to his devotion to a certain lady only closed by death his life had been lived as it were in shadow still he possessed a peculiar influence in society because it was known to be impossible to get him to look at things in a complicated way he was regarded rather as a last resort however bad as that well theres old fitzharold try him he wont advise you but hell say something  and in the heart of that irreverent young man harbinger there stirred a sort of misgiving had he expressed himself too freely had he said anything too thick he had forgotten the old boy stirring bertie up with his foot he murmured forgot you didnt know sir bertie will explain  thus called on bertie opening his lips a very little way and fixing his halfclosed eyes on his greatuncle explained there was a lady at the cottagea nice womanmr courtier knew herold miltoun went there sometimesrather late the other eveningthese devils were making the most of itsuggestinglose him the election if they didnt look out perfect rot of course  in his opinion old miltoun though as steady as time had been a flat to let the woman come out with him on to the green showing clearly where he had been when he ran to courtiers rescue you couldnt play about with women who had no form that anyone knew anything of however promising they might look  then out of a silence winlow asked what was to be done should miltoun be wired for a thing like this spread like wildfire sir williama man not accustomed to underrate difficultieswas afraid it was going to be troublesome harbinger expressed the opinion that the editor ought to be kicked did anybody know what courtier had done when he heard of it where was hedining in his room bertie suggested that if miltoun was at valleys house it mightnt be too late to wire to him the thing ought to be stemmed at once and in all this concern about the situation there kept cropping out quaint little outbursts of desire to disregard the whole thing as infernal insolence and metaphorically to punch the beggars heads natural to young men of breeding  then out of another silence came the voice of lord dennis  i am thinking of this poor lady  turning a little abruptly towards that dry suave voice and recovering the selfpossession which seldom deserted him harbinger murmured  quite so sir of course     chapter ix  in the lesser withdrawing room used when there was so small a party mrs winlow had gone to the piano and was playing to herself for lady casterley lady valleys and her two daughters had drawn together as though united to face this invading rumour  it was curious testimony to miltouns character that no more here than in the dininghall was there any doubt of the integrity of his relations with mrs noel but whereas there the matter was confined to its electioneering aspect here that aspect was already perceived to be only the fringe of its importance those feminine minds going with intuitive swiftness to the core of anything which affected their own males had already grasped the fact that the rumour would as it were chain a man of miltouns temper to this woman  but they were walking on such a thin crust of facts and there was so deep a quagmire of supposition beneath that talk was almost painfully difficult never before perhaps had each of these four women realized so clearly how much miltounthat rather strange and unknown grandson son and brothercounted in the scheme of existence their suppressed agitation was manifested in very different ways lady casterley upright in her chair showed it only by an added decision of speech a continual restless movement of one hand a thin line between her usually smooth brows lady valleys wore a puzzled look as if a little surprised that she felt serious agatha looked frankly anxious she was in her quiet way a woman of much character endowed with that natural piety which accepts without questioning the established order in life and religion the world to her being home and family she had a real if gently expressed horror of all that she instinctively felt to be subversive of this ideal people judged her a little quiet dull and narrow they compared her to a hen for ever clucking round her chicks the streak of heroism that lay in her nature was not perhaps of patent order her feeling about her brothers situation however was sincere and not to be changed or comforted she saw him in danger of being damaged in the only sense in which she could conceive of a manas a husband and a father it was this that went to her heart though her piety proclaimed to her also the peril of his soul for she shared the high church view of the indissolubility of marriage  as to barbara she stood by the hearth leaning her white shoulders against the carved marble her hands behind her looking down now and then her lips curled her level brows twitched a faint sigh came from her then a little smile would break out and be instantly suppressed she alone was silentyouth criticizing life her judgment voiced itself only in the untroubled rise and fall of her young bosom the impatience of her brows the downward look of her blue eyes full of a lazy inextinguishable light  lady valleys sighed  if only he werent such a queer boy hes quite capable of marrying her from sheer perversity  what said lady casterley  you havent seen her my dear a most unfortunately attractive creaturequite a charming face  agatha said quietly  mother if she was divorced i dont think eustace would  theres that certainly murmured lady valleys hope for the best  dont you even know which way it was said lady casterley  well the vicar says she did the divorcing but hes very charitable it may be as agatha hopes  i detest vagueness why doesnt someone ask the woman  you shall come with me granny dear and ask her yourself you will do it so nicely  lady casterley looked up  we shall see she said something struggled with the autocratic criticism in her eyes no more than the rest of the world could she help indulging barbara as one who believed in the divinity of her order she liked this splendid child she even admiredthough admiration was not what she excelled inthat warm joy in life as of some great nymph parting the waves with bare limbs tossing from her the foam of breakers she felt that in this granddaughter rather than in the good agatha the patrician spirit was housed there were points to agatha earnestness and high principle but something morally narrow and overanglican slightly offended the practical thisworldly temper of lady casterley it was a weakness and she disliked weakness barbara would never be squeamish over moral questions or matters such as were not really essential to aristocracy she might indeed err too much the other way from sheer high spirits as the impudent child had said if people had no pasts they would have no futures and lady casterley could not bear people without futures she was ambitious not with the low ambition of one who had risen from nothing but with the high passion of one on the top who meant to stay there  and where have you been meeting thiseranonymous creature she asked  barbara came from the hearth and bending down beside lady casterleys chair seemed to envelop her completely  im all right granny she couldnt corrupt me  lady casterleys face peered out doubtfully from that warmth wearing a look of disapproving pleasure  i know your wiles she said come now  i see her about shes nice to look at we talk  again with that hurried quietness agatha said  my dear babs i do think you ought to wait  my dear angel why what is it to me if shes had four husbands  agatha bit her lips and lady valleys murmured with a laugh  you really are a terror babs  but the sound of mrs winlows music had ceasedthe men had come in and the faces of the four women hardened as if they had slipped on masks for though this was almost or quite a family party the winlows being second cousins still the subject was one which each of these four in their very different ways felt to be beyond general discussion talk now began glancing from the war scarewinlow had it very specially that this would be over in a weekto brabrooks speech in progress at that very moment of which harbinger provided an imitation it sped to winlows flightto andrew grants articles in the parthenonto the caricature of harbinger in the cackler inscribed the new tory lord hrbngr brings social reform beneath the notice of his friends which depicted him introducing a naked baby to a number of coroneted old ladies thence to a dancer thence to the bill for universal assurance then back to the war scare to the last book of a great french writer and once more to winlows flight it was all straightforward and outspoken each seeming to say exactly what came into the head for all that there was a curious avoidance of the spiritual significances of these things or was it perhaps that such significances were not seen  lord dennis at the far end of the room studying a portfolio of engravings felt a touch on his cheek and conscious of a certain fragrance said without turning his head  nice things these babs  receiving no answer he looked up  there indeed stood barbara  i do hate sneering behind peoples backs  there had always been good comradeship between these two since the days when barbara a goldenhaired child astride of a grey pony had been his morning companion in the row all through the season his riding days were past he had now no outdoor pursuit save fishing which he followed with the ironic persistence of a selfcontained highspirited nature which refuses to admit that the mysterious finger of old age is laid across it but though she was no longer his companion he still had a habit of expecting her confidences and he looked after her moving away from him to a window with surprised concern  it was one of those nights dark yet gleaming when there seems a flying malice in the heavens when the stars from under and above the black clouds are like eyes frowning and flashing down at men with purposed malevolence the great sighing trees even had caught this spirit save one a dark spirelike cypress planted three hundred and fifty years before whose tall form incarnated the very spirit of tradition and neither swayed nor soughed like the others from her too closefibred too resisting to admit the breath of nature only a dry rustle came still almost exotic in spite of her centuries of sojourn and now brought to life by the eyes of night she seemed almost terrifying in her narrow spearlike austerity as though something had dried and died within her soul barbara came back from the window  we cant do anything in our lives it seems to me she said but play at taking risks  lord dennis replied dryly  i dont think i understand my dear  look at mr courtier muttered barbara his lifes so much more risky altogether than any of our men folk lead and yet they sneer at him  lets see what has he done  oh i dare say not very much but its all neck or nothing but what does anything matter to harbinger for instance if his social reform comes to nothing hell still be harbinger with fifty thousand a year  lord dennis looked up a little queerly  what is it possible you dont take the young man seriously babs  barbara shrugged a strap slipped a little off one white shoulder  its all play really and he knows ityou can tell that from his voice he cant help its not mattering of course and he knows that too  i have heard that hes after you babs is that true  he hasnt caught me yet  will he  barbaras answer was another shrug and for all their statuesque beauty the movement of her shoulders was like the shrug of a little girl in her pinafore  and this mr courtier said lord dennis dryly are you after him  im after everything didnt you know that dear  in reason my child  in reason of courselike poor eusty she stopped harbinger himself was standing there close by with an air as nearly approaching reverence as was ever to be seen on him in truth the way in which he was looking at her was almost timorous  will you sing that song i like so much lady babs  they moved away together and lord dennis gazing after that magnificent young couple stroked his beard gravely     chapter x  miltouns sudden journey to london had been undertaken in pursuance of a resolve slowly forming from the moment he met mrs noel in the stone flagged passage of burracombe farm if she would have him and since last evening he believed she wouldhe intended to marry her  it has been said that except for one lapse his life had been austere but this is not to assert that he had no capacity for passion the contrary was the case that flame which had been so jealously guarded smouldered deep within hima smothered fire with but little air to feed on the moment his spirit was touched by the spirit of this woman it had flared up she was the incarnation of all that he desired her hair her eyes her form the tiny tuck or dimple at the corner of her mouth just where a child places its finger her way of moving a sort of unconscious swaying or yielding to the air the tone in her voice which seemed to come not so much from happiness of her own as from an innate wish to make others happy and that natural if not robust intelligence which belongs to the very sympathetic and is rarely found in women of great ambitions or enthusiasmsall these things had twined themselves round his heart he not only dreamed of her and wanted her he believed in her she filled his thoughts as one who could never do wrong as one who though a wife would remain a mistress and though a mistress would always be the companion of his spirit  it has been said that no one spoke or gossiped about women in miltouns presence and the tale of her divorce was present to his mind simply in the form of a conviction that she was an injured woman after his interview with the vicar he had only once again alluded to it and that in answer to the speech of a lady staying at the court oh yes i remember her case perfectly she was the poor woman who did not i am certain lady bonington the tone of his voice had made someone laugh uneasily the subject was changed  all divorce was against his convictions but in a blurred way he admitted that there were cases where release was unavoidable he was not a man to ask for confidences or expect them to be given him he himself had never confided his spiritual struggles to any living creature and the unspiritual struggle had little interest for miltoun he was ready at any moment to stake his life on the perfection of the idol he had set up within his soul as simply and straightforwardly as he would have placed his body in front of her to shield her from harm  the same fanaticism which looked on his passion as a flower by itself entirely apart from its suitability to the social garden was also the driving force which sent him up to london to declare his intention to his father before he spoke to mrs noel the thing should be done simply and in right order for he had the kind of moral courage found in those who live retired within the shell of their own aspirations yet it was not perhaps so much active moral courage as indifference to what others thought or did coming from his inbred resistance to the appreciation of what they felt  that peculiar smile of the old tudor cardinalwhich had in it invincible selfreliance and a sort of spiritual sneerplayed over his face when he speculated on his fathers reception of the coming news and very soon he ceased to think of it at all burying himself in the work he had brought with him for the journey for he had in high degree the faculty so essential to public life of switching off his whole attention from one subject to another  on arriving at paddington he drove straight to valleys house  this large dwelling with its pillared portico seemed to wear an air of faint surprise that at the height of the season it was not more inhabited three servants relieved miltoun of his little luggage and having washed and learned that his father would be dining in he went for a walk taking his way towards his rooms in the temple his long figure somewhat carelessly garbed attracted the usual attention of which he was as usual unaware strolling along he meditated deeply on a london an england different from this flatulent hurlyburly this omniuin gatherum this great discordant symphony of sharps and flats a london an england kempt and selfrespecting swept and garnished of slums and plutocrats advertisement and jerrybuilding of sensationalism vulgarity vice and unemployment an england where each man should know his place and never change it but serve in it loyally in his own caste where every man from nobleman to labourer should be an oligarch by faith and a gentleman by practice an england so steelbright and efficient that the very sight should suffice to impose peace an england whose soul should be stoical and fine with the stoicism and fineness of each soul amongst her many million souls where the town should have its creed and the country its creed and there should be contentment and no complaining in her streets  and as he walked down the strand a little ragged boy cheeped out between his legs  bloodee discoveree in a bankgrite sensytion pier  miltoun paid no heed to that saying yet with it the wind that blows where man lives the careless wonderful unordered wind had dispersed his austere and formal vision great was that windthe myriad aspiration of men and women the praying of the uncounted multitude to the goddess of sensationof chance and change a flowing from heart to heart from lip to lip as in spring the wistful air wanders through a wood imparting to every bush and tree the secrets of fresh life the passionate resolve to grow and becomeno matter what a sighing as eternal as the old murmuring of the sea as little to be hushed as prone to swell into sudden roaring  miltoun held on through the traffic not looking overmuch at the present forms of the thousands he passed but seeing with the eyes of faith the forms he desired to see near st pauls he stopped in front of an old bookshop his grave pallid not unhandsome face was wellknown to william rimall its small proprietor who at once brought out his latest acquisitiona mores utopia that particular edition he assured miltoun was quite unprocurablehe had never sold but one other copy which had been literally crumbling away this copy was in even better condition it could hardly last another twenty yearsa genuine book a bargain there wasnt so much movement in more as there had been a little time back  miltoun opened the tome and a small booklouse who had been sleeping on the word tranibore began to make its way slowly towards the very centre of the volume  i see its genuine said miltoun  its not to read my lord the little man warned him hardly safe to turn the pages as i was sayingive not had a better piece this year i havent really  shrewd old dreamer muttered miltoun the socialists havent got beyond him even now  the little mans eyes blinked as though apologizing for the views of thomas more  well he said i suppose he was one of them i forget if your lordships very strong on politics  miltoun smiled  i want to see an england rimall something like the england of mores dream but my machinery will be different i shall begin at the top  the little man nodded  quite so quite so he said we shall come to that i dare say  we must rimall and miltoun turned the page  the little mans face quivered  i dont think he said that books quite strong enough for you my lord with your taste for reading now ive a most curious old volume hereon chinese temples its rarebut not too old you can peruse it thoroughly its what i call a book to browse on just suit your palate funny principle they built those things on he added opening the volume at an engraving in layers we dont build like that in england  miltoun looked up sharply the little mans face wore no signs of understanding  unfortunately we dont rimall he said we ought to and we shall ill take this book  placing his finger on the print of the pagoda he added a good symbol  the little booksellers eye strayed down the temple to the secret price mark  exactly my lord he said i thought itd be your fancy the price to you will be twentyseven and six  miltoun pocketing the bargain walked out he made his way into the temple left the book at his chambers and passed on down to the bank of mother thames the sun was loving her passionately that afternoon he had kissed her into warmth and light and colour and all the buildings along her banks as far as the towers at westminster seemed to be smiling it was a great sight for the eyes of a lover and another vision came haunting miltoun of a softeyed woman with a low voice bending amongst her flowers nothing would be complete without her no work bear fruit no scheme could have full meaning  lord valleys greeted his son at dinner with good fellowship and a faint surprise  day off my dear fellow or have you come up to hear brabrook pitch into us hes rather late this timeweve got rid of that balloon business no trouble after all  and he eyed miltoun with that clear grey stare of his so cool level and curious now what sort of bird is this it seemed saying certainly not the partridge i should have expected from its breeding  miltouns answer i came up to tell you some thing sir riveted his fathers stare for a second longer than was quite urbane  it would not be true to say that lord valleys was afraid of his son fear was not one of his emotions but he certainly regarded him with a respectful curiosity that bordered on uneasiness the oligarchic temper of miltouns mind and political convictions almost shocked one who knew both by temperament and experience how to wait in front this instruction he had frequently had occasion to give his jockeys when he believed his horses could best get home first in that way and it was an instruction he now longed to give his son he himself had waited in front for over fifty years and he knew it to be the finest way of insuring that he would never be compelled to alter this desirable policyfor something in lord valleys character made him fear that in real emergency he would exert himself to the point of the gravest discomfort sooner than be left to wait behind a fellow like young harbinger of course he understoodversatile full of beans as he expressed it to himself in his more confidential moments who had imbibed the new wine very intoxicating it was of desire for social reform he would have to be given his head a littlebut there would be no difficulty with him he would never run outlight handy build of horse that only required steadying at the corners he would want to hear himself talk and be let feel that he was doing something all very well and quite intelligible but with miltoun and lord valleys felt this to be no mere parental fancy it was a very different business his son had a way of forcing things to their conclusions which was dangerous and reminded him of his motherinlaw he was a baby in public affairs of course as yet but as soon as he once got going the intensity of his convictions together with his position and real giftnot of the gab like harbingersbut of restrained biting oratory was sure to bring him to the front with a bound in the present state of parties and what were those convictions lord valleys had tried to understand them but up to the present he had failed and this did not surprise him exactly since as he often said political convictions were not as they appeared on the surface the outcome of reason but merely symptoms of temperament and he could not comprehend because he could not sympathize with any attitude towards public affairs that was not essentially level attached to the plain commonsense factors of the case as they appeared to himself not that he could fairly be called a temporizer for deep down in him there was undoubtedly a vein of obstinate fundamental loyalty to the traditions of a caste which prized high spirit beyond all things still he did feel that miltoun was altogether too much the pukka aristocratno better than a socialist with his confounded way of seeing things all cut and dried his ideas of forcing reforms down peoples throats and holding them there with the iron hand with his way too of acting on his principles why he even admitted that he acted on his principles this thought always struck a very discordant note in lord valleys breast it was almost indecent worseridiculous the fact was the dear fellow had unfortunately a deeper habit of thought than was wanted in politicsdangerousvery experience might do something for him and out of his own long experience the earl of valleys tried hard to recollect any politician whom the practice of politics had left where he was when he started he could not think of one but this gave him little comfort and above a piece of late asparagus his steady eyes sought his sons what had he come up to tell him  the phrase had been ominous he could not recollect miltouns ever having told him anything for though a really kind and indulgent father he hadlike so many men occupied with public and other livesa little acquired towards his offspring the look and manner is this mine of his four children barbara alone he claimed with conviction he admired her and being a man who savoured life he was unable to love much except where he admired but the last person in the world to hustle any man or force a confidence he waited to hear his sons news betraying no uneasiness  miltoun seemed in no hurry he described courtiers adventure which tickled lord valleys a good deal  ordeal by red pepper shouldnt have thought them equal to that he said so youve got him at monkland now harbinger still with you  yes i dont think harbinger has much stamina  politically  miltoun nodded  i rather resent his being on our sidei dont think he does us any good youve seen that cartoon i suppose it cuts pretty deep i couldnt recognize you amongst the old women sir  lord valleys smiled impersonally  very clever thing by the way i shall win the eclipse i think  and thus spasmodically the conversation ran till the last servant had left the room  then miltoun without preparation looked straight at his father and said  i want to marry mrs noel sir  lord valleys received the shot with exactly the same expression as that with which he was accustomed to watch his horses beaten then he raised his wineglass to his lips and set it down again untouched this was the only sign he gave of interest or discomfiture  isnt this rather sudden  miltoun answered ive wanted to from the moment i first saw her  lord valleys almost as good a judge of a man and a situation as of a horse or a pointer dog leaned back in his chair and said with faint sarcasm  my dear fellow its good of you to have told me this though to be quite frank its a piece of news i would rather not have heard  a dusky flush burned slowly up in miltouns cheeks he had underrated his father the man had coolness and courage in a crisis  what is your objection sir and suddenly he noticed that a wafer in lord valleys hand was quivering this brought into his eyes no look of compunction but such a smouldering gaze as the old tudor churchman might have bent on an adversary who showed a sign of weakness lord valleys too noticed the quivering of that wafer and ate it  we are men of the world he said  miltoun answered i am not  showing his first real symptom of impatience lord valleys rapped out  so be it i am  yes said miltoun  eustace  nursing one knee miltoun faced that appeal without the faintest movement his eyes continued to burn into his fathers face a tremor passed over lord valleys heart what intensity of feeling there was in the fellow that he could look like this at the first breath of opposition  he reached out and took up the cigarbox held it absently towards his son and drew it quickly back  i forgot he said you dont  and lighting a cigar he smoked gravely looking straight before him a furrow between his brows he spoke at last  she looks like a lady i know nothing else about her  the smile deepened round miltouns mouth  why should you want to know anything else  lord valleys shrugged his philosophy had hardened  i understand for one thing he said coldly that there is a matter of a divorce i thought you took the churchs view on that subject  she has not done wrong  you know her story then  no  lord valleys raised his brows in irony and a sort of admiration  chivalry the better part of discretion  miltoun answered  you dont i think understand the kind of feeling i have for mrs noel it does not come into your scheme of things it is the only feeling however with which i should care to marry and i am not likely to feel it for anyone again  lord valleys felt once more that uncanny sense of insecurity was this true and suddenly he felt yes it is true the face before him was the face of one who would burn in his own fire sooner than depart from his standards and a sudden sense of the utter seriousness of this dilemma dumbed him  i can say no more at the moment he muttered and got up from the table     chapter xi  lady casterley was that inconvenient thingan early riser no woman in the kingdom was a better judge of a dew carpet nature had in her time displayed before her thousands of those pretty fabrics where all the stars of the past night dropped to the dark earth were waiting to glide up to heaven again on the rays of the sun at ravensham she walked regularly in her gardens between halfpast seven and eight and when she paid a visit was careful to subordinate whatever might be the local custom to this habit  when therefore her maid randle came to barbaras maid at seven oclock and said my old lady wants lady babs to get up there was no particular pain in the breast of barbaras maid who was doing up her corsets she merely answered ill see to it lady babs wont be too pleased and ten minutes later she entered that whitewalled room which smelled of pinksa temple of drowsy sweetness where the summer light was vaguely stealing through flowered chintz curtains  barbara was sleeping with her cheek on her hand and her tawny hair gathered back streaming over the pillow her lips were parted and the maid thought id like to have hair and a mouth like that she could not help smiling to herself with pleasure lady babs looked so prettyprettier asleep even than awake and at sight of that beautiful creature sleeping and smiling in her sleep the earthy hothouse fumes steeping the mind of one perpetually serving in an atmosphere unsuited to her natural growth dispersed beauty with its queer touching power of freeing the spirit from all barriers and thoughts of self sweetened the maids eyes and kept her standing holding her breath for barbara asleep was a symbol of that golden age in which she so desperately believed she opened her eyes and seeing the maid said  is it eight oclock stacey  no but lady casterley wants you to walk with her  oh bother i was having such a dream  yes you were smiling  i was dreaming that i could fly  fancy  i could see everything spread out below me as close as i see you i was hovering like a buzzard hawk i felt that i could come down exactly where i wanted it was fascinating i had perfect power stacey  and throwing her neck back she closed her eyes again the sunlight streamed in on her between the halfdrawn curtains  the queerest impulse to put out a hand and stroke that full white throat shot through the maids mind  these flying machines are stupid murmured barbara the pleasures in ones bodywings  i can see lady casterley in the garden  barbara sprang out of bed close by the statue of diana lady casterley was standing gazing down at some flowers a tiny grey figure barbara sighed with her in her dream had been another buzzard hawk and she was filled with a sort of surprise and queer pleasure that ran down her in little shivers while she bathed and dressed  in her haste she took no hat and still busy with the fastening of her linen frock hurried down the stairs and georgian corridor towards the garden at the end of it she almost ran into the arms of courtier  awakening early this morning he had begun first thinking of audrey noel threatened by scandal then of his yesterdays companion that glorious young creature whose image had so gripped and taken possession of him in the pleasure of this memory he had steeped himself she was youth itself that perfect thing a young girl without callowness  and his words when she nearly ran into him were the winged victory  barbaras answer was equally symbolic a buzzard hawk do you know i dreamed we were flying mr courtier  courtier gravely answered  if the gods give me that dream  from the garden door barbara turned her head smiled and passed through  lady casterley in the company of little ann who had perceived that it was novel to be in the garden at this hour had been scrutinizing some newly founded colonies of a flower with which she was not familiar on seeing her granddaughter approach she said at once  what is this thing  nemesia  never heard of it  its rather the fashion granny  nemesia repeated lady casterley what has nemesis to do with flowers i have no patience with gardeners and these idiotic names where is your hat i like that ducks egg colour in your frock theres a button undone and reaching up her little spidery hand wonderfully steady considering its age she buttoned the top button but one of barbaras bodice  you look very blooming my dear she said how far is it to this womans cottage well go there now  she wouldnt be up  lady casterleys eyes gleamed maliciously  you tell me shes so nice she said no nice unencumbered woman lies in bed after halfpast seven which is the very shortest way no ann we cant take you  little ann after regarding her greatgrandmother rather too intently replied  well i cant come you see because ive got to go  very well said lady casterley then trot along  little ann tightening her lips walked to the next colony of nemesia and bent over the colonists with concentration showing clearly that she had found something more interesting than had yet been encountered  ha said lady casterley and led on at her brisk pace towards the avenue  all the way down the drive she discoursed on woodcraft glancing sharply at the trees forestryshe saidlike building and all other pursuits which required faith and patient industry was a lost art in this secondhand age she had made barbaras grandfather practise it so that at catton her country place and even at ravensham the trees were worth looking at here at monkland they were monstrously neglected to have the finest italian cypress in the country for example and not take more care of it was a downright scandal  barbara listened smiling lazily granny was so amusing in her energy and precision and her turns of speech so deliberately homespun as if shethan whom none could better use a stiff and polished phrase or the refinements of the french languagewere determined to take what liberties she liked to the girl haunted still by the feeling that she could fly almost drunk on the sweetness of the air that summer morning it seemed funny that anyone should be like that then for a second she saw her grandmothers face in repose off guard grim with anxious purpose as if questioning its hold on life and in one of those flashes of intuition which come to womeneven when young and conquering like barbarashe felt suddenly sorry as though she had caught sight of the pale spectre never yet seen by her poor old dear she thought what a pity to be old  but they had entered the footpath crossing three long meadows which climbed up towards mrs noels it was so goldensweet here amongst the million tiny saffron cups frosted with lingering dewshine there was such flying glory in the limes and ashtrees so delicate a scent from the late whins and mayflower and on every tree a greybird calling to be sorry was not possible  in the far corner of the first field a chestnut mare was standing with ears pricked at some distant sound whose charm she alone perceived on viewing the intruders she laid those ears back and a little vicious star gleamed out at the corner of her eye they passed her and entered the second field half way across barbara said quietly  granny thats a bull  it was indeed an enormous bull who had been standing behind a clump of bushes he was moving slowly towards them still distant about two hundred yards a great red beast with the huge development of neck and front which makes the bull of all living creatures the symbol of brute force  lady casterley envisaged him severely  i dislike bulls she said i think i must walk backward  you cant its too uphill  i am not going to turn back said lady casterley the bull ought not to be here whose fault is it i shall speak to someone stand still and look at him we must prevent his coming nearer  they stood still and looked at the bull who continued to approach  it doesnt stop him said lady casterley we must take no notice give me your arm my dear my legs feel rather funny  barbara put her arm round the little figure they walked on  i have not been used to bulls lately said lady casterley the bull came nearer  granny said barbara you must go quietly on to the stile when youre over ill come too  certainly not said lady casterley we will go together take no notice of him i have great faith in that  granny darling you must do as i say please i remember this bull he is one of ours  at those rather ominous words lady casterley gave her a sharp glance  i shall not go she said my legs feel quite strong now we can run if necessary  so can the bull said barbara  im not going to leave you muttered lady casterley if he turns vicious i shall talk to him he wont touch me you can run faster than i so thats settled  dont be absurd dear answered barbara i am not afraid of bulls  lady casterley flashed a look at her which had a gleam of amusement  i can feel you she said youre just as trembly as i am  the bull was now distant some eighty yards and they were still quite a hundred from the stile  granny said barbara if you dont go on as i tell you i shall just leave you and go and meet him you mustnt be obstinate  lady casterleys answer was to grip her granddaughter round the waist the nervous force of that thin arm was surprising  you will do nothing of the sort she said i refuse to have anything more to do with this bull i shall simply pay no attention  the bull now began very slowly ambling towards them  take no notice said lady casterley who was walking faster than she had ever walked before  the ground is level now said barbara can you run  i think so gasped lady casterley and suddenly she found herself halflifted from the ground and as it were flying towards the stile she heard a noise behind then barbaras voice  we must stop hes on us get behind me  she felt herself caught and pinioned by two arms that seemed set on the wrong way instinct and a general softness told her that she was back to back with her granddaughter  let me go she gasped let me go  and suddenly she felt herself being propelled by that softness forward towards the stile  shoo she said shoo  granny barbaras voice came calm and breathless dont you only excite him are we near the stile  ten yards panted lady casterley  look out then there was a sort of warm flurry round her a rush a heave a scramble she was beyond the stile the bull and barbara a yard or two apart were just the other side lady casterley raised her handkerchief and fluttered it the bull looked up barbara all legs and arms came slipping down beside her  without wasting a moment lady casterley leaned forward and addressed the bull  you awful brute she said i will have you well flogged  gently pawing the ground the bull snuffled  are you any the worse child  not a scrap said barbaras serene still breathless voice  lady casterley put up her hands and took the girls face between them  what legs you have she said give me a kiss  having received a hot rather quivering kiss she walked on holding somewhat firmly to barbaras arm  as for that bull she murmured the bruteto attack women  barbara looked down at her  granny she said are you sure youre not shaken  lady casterley whose lips were quivering pressed them together very hard  not a bbbit  dont you think said barbara that we had better go back at oncethe other way  certainly not there are no more bulls i suppose between us and this woman  but are you fit to see her  lady casterley passed her handkerchief over her lips to remove their quivering  perfectly she answered  then dear said barbara stand still a minute while i dust you behind  this having been accomplished they proceeded in the direction of mrs noels cottage  at sight of it lady casterley said  i shall put my foot down its out of the question for a man of miltouns prospects i look forward to seeing him prime minister some day hearing barbaras voice murmuring above her she paused whats that you say  i said what is the use of our being what we are if we cant love whom we like  love said lady casterley i was talking of marriage  i am glad you admit the distinction granny dear  you are pleased to be sarcastic said lady casterley listen to me its the greatest nonsense to suppose that people in our caste are free to do as they please the sooner you realize that the better babs i am talking to you seriously the preservation of our position as a class depends on our observing certain decencies what do you imagine would happen to the royal family if they were allowed to marry as they liked all this marrying with gaiety girls and american money and people with pasts and writers and so forth is most damaging theres far too much of it and it ought to be stopped it may be tolerated for a few cranks or silly young men and these new women but for eustace lady casterley paused again and her fingers pinched barbaras arm or for youtheres only one sort of marriage possible as for eustace i shall speak to this good lady and see that he doesnt get entangled further  absorbed in the intensity of her purpose she did not observe a peculiar little smile playing round barbaras lips  you had better speak to nature too granny  lady casterley stopped short and looked up in her granddaughters face  now what do you mean by that she said tell me  but noticing that barbaras lips had closed tightly she gave her arm a hardif unintentionalpinch and walked on     chapter xii  lady casterleys rather malicious diagnosis of audrey noel was correct the unencumbered woman was up and in her garden when barbara and her grandmother appeared at the wicket gate but being near the limetree at the far end she did not hear the rapid colloquy which passed between them  you are going to be good granny  as to thatit will depend  you promised  hm  lady casterley could not possibly have provided herself with a better introduction than barbara whom mrs noel never met without the sheer pleasure felt by a sympathetic woman when she sees embodied in someone else that joy in life which fate has not permitted to herself  she came forward with her head a little on one side a trick of hers not at all affected and stood waiting  the unembarrassed barbara began at once  weve just had an encounter with a bull this is my grandmother lady casterley  the little old ladys demeanour confronted with this very pretty face and figure was a thought less autocratic and abrupt than usual her shrewd eyes saw at once that she had no common adventuress to deal with she was woman of the world enough too to know that birth was not what it had been in her young days that even money was rather rococo and that good looks manners and a knowledge of literature art and music and this woman looked like one of that sort were often considered socially more valuable she was therefore both wary and affable  how do you do she said i have heard of you may we sit down for a minute in your garden the bull was a wretch  but even in speaking she was uneasily conscious that mrs noels clear eyes were seeing very well what she had come for the look in them indeed was almost cynical and in spite of her sympathetic murmurs she did not somehow seem to believe in the bull this was disconcerting why had barbara condescended to mention the wretched brute and she decided to take him by the horns  babs she said go to the inn and order me a fly i shall drive back i feel very shaky and as mrs noel offered to send her maid she added  no no my granddaughter will go  barbara having departed with a quizzical look lady casterley patted the rustic seat and said  do come and sit down i want to talk to you  mrs noel obeyed and at once lady casterley perceived that she had a most difficult task before her she had not expected a woman with whom one could take no liberties those clear dark eyes and that soft perfectly graceful mannerto a person so sympathetic one should be able to say anything andone couldnt it was awkward and suddenly she noticed that mrs noel was sitting perfectly upright as uprightmore upright than she was herself a bad signa very bad sign taking out her handkerchief she put it to her lips  i suppose you think she said that we were not chased by a bull  i am sure you were  indeed ah but ive something else to talk to you about  mrs noels face quivered back as a flower might when it was going to be plucked and again lady casterley put her handkerchief to her lips this time she rubbed them hard there was nothing to come off to do so therefore was a satisfaction  i am an old woman she said and you mustnt mind what i say  mrs noel did not answer but looked straight at her visitor to whom it seemed suddenly that this was another person what was it about that face staring at her in a weird way it reminded her of a child that one had hurtwith those great eyes and that soft hair and the mouth thin in a line all of a sudden and as if it had been jerked out of her she said  i dont want to hurt you my dear its about my grandson of course  but mrs noel made neither sign nor motion and the feeling of irritation which so rapidly attacks the old when confronted by the unexpected came to lady casterleys aid  his name she said is being coupled with yours in a way thats doing him a great deal of harm you dont wish to injure him im sure  mrs noel shook her head and lady casterley went on  i dont know what theyre not saying since the evening your friend mr courtier hurt his knee miltoun has been most unwise you had not perhaps realized that  mrs noels answer was bitterly distinct  i didnt know anyone was sufficiently interested in my doings  lady casterley suffered a gesture of exasperation to escape her  good heavens she said every common person is interested in a woman whose position is anomalous living alone as you do and not a widow youre fair game for everybody especially in the country  mrs noels sidelong glance very clear and cynical seemed to say even for you  i am not entitled to ask your story lady casterley went on but if you make mysteries you must expect the worst interpretation put on them my grandson is a man of the highest principle he does not see things with the eyes of the world and that should have made you doubly careful not to compromise him especially at a time like this  mrs noel smiled this smile startled lady casterley it seemed by concealing everything to reveal depths of strength and subtlety would the woman never show her hand and she said abruptly  anything serious of course is out of the question  quite  that word which of all others seemed the right one was spoken so that lady casterley did not know in the least what it meant though occasionally employing irony she detested it in others no woman should be allowed to use it as a weapon but in these days when they were so foolish as to want votes one never knew what women would be at this particular woman however did not look like one of that sort she was femininevery femininethe sort of creature that spoiled men by being too nice to them and though she had come determined to find out all about everything and put an end to it she saw barbara reentering the wicket gate with considerable relief  i am ready to walk home now she said and getting up from the rustic seat she made mrs noel a satirical little bow  thank you for letting me rest give me your arm child  barbara gave her arm and over her shoulder threw a swift smile at mrs noel who did not answer it but stood looking quietly after them her eyes immensely dark and large  out in the lane lady casterley walked on very silent digesting her emotions  what about the fly granny  what fly  the one you told me to order  you dont mean to say that you took me seriously  no said barbara  ha  they proceeded some little way farther before lady casterley said suddenly  she is deep  and dark said barbara i am afraid you were not good  lady casterley glanced upwards  i detest this habit she said amongst you young people of taking nothing seriously not even bulls she added with a grim smile  barbara threw back her head and sighed  nor flys she said  lady casterley saw that she had closed her eyes and opened her lips and she thought  shes a very beautiful girl i had no idea she was so beautifulbut too big and she added aloud  shut your mouth you will get one down  they spoke no more till they had entered the avenue then lady casterley said sharply  who is this coming down the drive  mr courtier i think  what does he mean by it with that leg  he is coming to talk to you granny  lady casterley stopped short  you are a cat she said a sly cat now mind babs i wont have it  no darling murmured barbara you shant have itill take him off your hands  what does your mother mean stammered lady casterley letting you grow up like this youre as bad as she was at your age  worse said barbara i dreamed last night that i could fly  if you try that said lady casterley grimly youll soon come to grief goodmorning sir you ought to be in bed  courtier raised his hat  surely it is not for me to be where you are not and he added gloomily the war scares dead  ah said lady casterley your occupations gone then youll go back to london now i suppose looking suddenly at barbara she saw that the girls eyes were halfclosed and that she was smiling it seemed to lady casterley too or was it fancythat she shook her head     chapter xiii  thanks to lady valleys a patroness of birds no owl was ever shot on the monkland court estate and those softflying spirits of the dusk hooted and hunted to the great benefit of all except the creeping voles by every farm cottage and field they passed invisible quartering the dark air their voyages of discovery stretched up on to the moor as far as the wild stone man whose origin their wisdom perhaps knew round audrey noels cottage they were as thick as thieves for they had just there two habitations in a long old hollygrown wall and almost seemed to be guarding the mistress of that thatched dwellingso numerous were their fluttering rushes so tenderly prolonged their soft sentinel callings now that the weather was really warm so that joy of life was in the voles they found those succulent creatures of an extraordinarily pleasant flavour and on them each pair was bringing up a family of exceptionally fine little owls very solemn with big heads bright large eyes and wings as yet only able to fly downwards there was scarcely any hour from noon of the day for some of them had horns to the small sweet hours when no one heard them that they forgot to salute the very large quiet wingless owl whom they could espy moving about by day above their mouseruns or preening her white and sometimes blue and sometimes grey feathers morning and evening in a large square hole high up in the front wall and they could not understand at all why no swift depredating graces nor any habit of long soft hooting belonged to that ladybird  on the evening of the day when she received that early morning call as soon as dusk had fallen wrapped in a long thin cloak with black lace over her dark hair audrey noel herself fluttered out into the lanes as if to join the grave winged hunters of the invisible night those far continual sounds not stilled in the country till long after the sun dies had but just ceased from haunting the air where the late mayscent clung as close as fragrance clings to a womans robe there was just the barking of a dog the boom of migrating chafers the song of the stream and of the owls to proclaim the beating in the heart of this sweet night nor was there any light by which nights face could be seen it was hidden anonymous so that when a lamp in a cottage threw a blink over the opposite bank it was as if some wandering painter had wrought a picture of stones and leaves on the black air framed it in purple and left it hanging yet if it could only have been come at the night was as full of emotion as this woman who wandered shrinking away against the banks if anyone passed stopping to cool her hot face with the dew on the ferns walking swiftly to console her warm heart anonymous night seeking for a symbol could have found none better than this errant figure to express its hidden longings the fluttering unseen rushes of its dark wings and all its secret passion of revolt against its own anonymity  at monkland court save for little ann the morning passed but dumbly everyone feeling that something must be done and no one knowing what at lunch the only allusion to the situation had been harbingers inquiry  when does miltoun return  he had wired it seemed to say that he was motoring down that night  the sooner the better sir william murmured weve still a fortnight  but all had felt from the tone in which he spoke these words how serious was the position in the eyes of that experienced campaigner  what with the collapse of the war scare and this canard about mrs noel there was indeed cause for alarm  the afternoon post brought a letter from lord valleys marked express  lady valleys opened it with a slight grimace which deepened as she read her handsome florid face wore an expression of sadness seldom seen there there was in fact more than a touch of dignity in her reception of the unpalatable news  eustace declares his intention of marrying this mrs noelso ran her husbands letteri know unfortunately of no way in which i can prevent him if you can discover legitimate means of dissuasion it would be well to use them my dear its the very devil  it was the very devil for if miltoun had already made up his mind to marry her without knowledge of the malicious rumour what would not be his determination now and the woman of the world rose up in lady valleys this marriage must not come off it was contrary to almost every instinct of one who was practical not only by character but by habit of life and training her warm and fullblooded nature had a sneaking sympathy with love and pleasure and had she not been practical she might have found this side of her a serious drawback to the main tenor of a life so much in view of the public eye her consciousness of this danger in her own case made her extremely alive to the risks of an undesirable connectionespecially if it were a marriageto any public man at the same time the motherheart in her was stirred eustace had never been so deep in her affection as bertie still he was her firstborn and in face of news which meant that he was lost to herfor this must indeed be the marriage of two minds or whatever that quotation wasshe felt strangely jealous of a woman who had won her sons love when she herself had never won it the aching of this jealousy gave her face for a moment almost a spiritual expression then passed away into impatience why should he marry her things could be arranged people spoke of it already as an illicit relationship well then let people have what they had invented if the worst came to the worst this was not the only constituency in england and a dissolution could not be far off better anything than a marriage which would handicap him all his life but would it be so great a handicap after all beauty counted for much if only her story were not too conspicuous but what was her story not to know it was absurd that was the worst of people who were not in society it was so difficult to find out and there rose in her that almost brutal resentment which ferments very rapidly in those who from their youth up have been hedged round with the belief that they and they alone are the whole of the world in this mood lady valleys passed the letter to her daughters they read and in turn handed it to bertie who in silence returned it to his mother  but that evening in the billiardroom having manoeuvred to get him to herself barbara said to courtier  i wonder if you will answer me a question mr courtier  if i may and can  her lowcut dress was of yewgreen with little threads of flamecolour matching her hair so that there was about her a splendour of darkness and whiteness and gold almost dazzling and she stood very still leaning back against the lighter green of the billiardtable grasping its edge so tightly that the smooth strong backs of her hands quivered  we have just heard that miltoun is going to ask mrs noel to marry him people are never mysterious are they without good reason i wanted you to tell mewho is she  i dont think i quite grasp the situation murmured courtier you saidto marry him  seeing that she had put out her hand as if begging for the truth he added how can your brother marry hershes married  oh  id no idea you didnt know that much  we thought there was a divorce  the expression of which mention has been madethat peculiar whitehot sardonically jolly lookvisited courtiers face at once hoist with their own petard the usual thing let a pretty woman live alonethe tongues of men will do the rest  it was not so bad as that said barbara dryly they said she had divorced her husband  caught out thus characteristically riding past the hounds courtier bit his lips  you had better hear the story now her father was a country parson and a friend of my fathers so that ive known her from a child stephen lees noel was his curate it was a snap marriageshe was only twenty and had met hardly any men her father was ill and wanted to see her settled before he died well she found out almost directly like a good many other people that shed made an utter mistake  barbara came a little closer  what was the man like  not bad in his way but one of those narrow conscientious pigheaded fellows who make the most trying kind of husbandbone egoistic a parson of that type has no chance at all every mortal thing he has to do or say helps him to develop his worst points the wife of a man like thats no better than a slave she began to show the strain of it at last though shes the sort who goes on till she snaps it took him four years to realize then the question was what were they to do hes a very high churchman with all their feeling about marriage but luckily his pride was wounded anyway they separated two years ago and there she is left high and dry people say it was her fault she ought to have known her own mindat twenty she ought to have held on and hidden it up somehow confound their thickskinned charitable souls what do they know of how a sensitive woman suffers forgive me lady barbarai get hot over this he was silent then seeing her eyes fixed on him went on her mother died when she was born her father soon after her marriage shes enough money of her own luckily to live on quietly as for him he changed his parish and runs one somewhere in the midlands ones sorry for the poor devil too of course they never see each other and so far as i know they dont correspond that lady barbara is the simple history  barbara said thank you and turned away and he heard her mutter what a shame  but he could not tell whether it was mrs noels fate or the husbands fate or the thought of miltoun that had moved her to those words  she puzzled him by her selfpossession so almost hard her way of refusing to show feeling yet what a woman she would make if the drying curse of highcaste life were not allowed to stereotype and shrivel her if enthusiasm were suffered to penetrate and fertilize her soul she reminded him of a great tawny lily he had a vision of her as that flower floating freed of roots and the mould of its cultivated soil in the liberty of the impartial air what a passionate and noble thing she might become what radiance and perfume she would exhale a spirit fleurdelys sister to all the noble flowers of light that inhabited the wind  leaning in the deep embrasure of his window he looked at anonymous night he could hear the owls hoot and feel a heart beating out there somewhere in the darkness but there came no answer to his wondering would shethis great tawny lily of a girlever become unconscious of her environment not in manner merely but in the very soul so that she might be just a woman breathing suffering loving and rejoicing with the poet soul of all mankind would she ever be capable of riding out with the little company of big hearts naked of advantage courtier had not been inside a church for twenty years having long felt that he must not enter the mosques of his country without putting off the shoes of freedom but he read the bible considering it a very great poem and the old words came haunting him verily i say unto you it is harder for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven and now looking into the night whose darkness seemed to hold the answer to all secrets he tried to read the riddle of this girls future with which there seemed so interwoven that larger enigma how far the spirit can free itself in this life from the matter that encompasseth  the night whispered suddenly and low down as if rising from the sea came the moon dropping a wan robe of light till she gleamed out nude against the skycurtain night was no longer anonymous there in the dusky garden the statue of diana formed slowly before his eyes and behind heras it were her templerose the tall spire of the cypress tree     chapter xiv  a copy of the bucklandbury news containing an account of his evening adventure did not reach miltoun till he was just starting on his return journey it came marked with blue pencil together with a note   my dear eustace  the enclosedhowever unwarranted and impudentrequires attention but we shall do nothing till you come back  yours ever  william shropton   the effect on miltoun might perhaps have been different had he not been so conscious of his intention to ask audrey noel to be his wife but in any circumstances it is doubtful whether he would have done more than smile and tear the paper up truly that sort of thing had so little power to hurt or disturb him personally that he was incapable of seeing how it could hurt or disturb others if those who read it were affected so much the worse for them he had a real if unobtrusive contempt for groundlings of whatever class and it never entered his head to step an inch out of his course in deference to their vagaries nor did it come home to him that mrs noel wrapped in the glamour which he cast about her could possibly suffer from the meanness of vulgar minds shroptons note indeed caused him the more annoyance of those two documents it was like his brotherinlaw to make much of little  he hardly dozed at all during his swift journey through the sleeping country nor when he reached his room at monkland did he go to bed he had the wonderful upborne feeling of man on the verge of achievement his spirit and senses were both on firefor that was the quality of this woman she suffered no part of him to sleep and he was glad of her exactions  he drank some tea went out and took a path up to the moor it was not yet eight oclock when he reached the top of the nearest tor and there below him around and above was a land and sky transcending even his exaltation it was like a symphony of great music or the nobility of a stupendous mind laid bare it was god up there in his many moods serenity was spread in the middle heavens blue illimitable and along to the east three huge clouds like thoughts brooding over the destinies below moved slowly toward the sea so that great shadows filled the valleys and the land that lay under all the other sky was gleaming and quivering with every colour as it were clothed with the divine smile the wind from the north whereon floated the white birds of the smaller clouds had no voice for it was above barriers utterly free before miltoun turning to this wind lay the maze of the lower lands the misty greens rose pinks and browns of the fields and white and grey dots and strokes of cottages and church towers fading into the blue veil of distance confined by a far range of hills behind him there was nothing but the restless surface of the moor coloured purplishbrown on that untamed sea of graven wildness could be seen no ship of man save one on the far horizonthe grim hulk dartmoor prison there was no sound no scent and it seemed to miltoun as if his spirit had left his body and become part of the solemnity of god yet as he stood there with his head bared that strange smile which haunted him in moments of deep feeling showed that he had not surrendered to the universal that his own spirit was but being fortified and that this was the true and secret source of his delight he lay down in a scoop of the stones the sun entered there but no wind so that a dry sweet scent exuded from the young shoots of heather that warmth and perfume crept through the shield of his spirit and stole into his blood ardent images rose before him the vision of an unending embrace out of an embrace sprang life out of that the world was made this world with its innumerable forms and naturesno two alike and from him and her would spring forms to take their place in the great pattern this seemed wonderful and rightfor they would be worthy forms who would hand on those traditions which seemed to him so necessary and great and then there broke on him one of those delirious waves of natural desire against which he had so often fought so often with great pain conquered he got up and ran downhill leaping over the stones and the thicker clumps of heather  audrey noel too had been early astir though she had gone late enough to bed she dressed languidly but very carefully being one of those women who put on armour against fate because they are proud and dislike the thought that their sufferings should make others suffer because too their bodies are to them as it were sacred having been given them in trust to cause delight when she had finished she looked at herself in the glass rather more distrustfully than usual she felt that her sort of woman was at a discount in these days and being sensitive she was never content either with her appearance or her habits but for all that she went on behaving in unsatisfactory ways because she incorrigibly loved to look as charming as she could and even if no one were going to see her she never felt that she looked charming enough she wasas lady casterley had shrewdly guessedthe kind of woman who spoils men by being too nice to them of no use to those who wish women to assert themselves yet having a certain passive stoicism very disconcerting with little or no power of initiative she would do what she was set to do with a thoroughness that would shame an initiator temperamentally unable to beg anything of anybody she required love as a plant requires water she could give herself completely yet remain oddly incorruptible in a word hopeless and usually beloved of those who thought her so  with all this however she was not quite what is called a sweet womana phrase she detestedfor there was in her a queer vein of gentle cynicism she saw with extraordinary clearness as if she had been born in italy and still carried that clear dry atmosphere about her soul she loved glow and warmth and colour such mysticism as she felt was pagan and she had few aspirationssufficient to her were things as they showed themselves to be  this morning when she had made herself smell of geraniums and fastened all the small contrivances that hold even the best of women together she went downstairs to her little diningroom set the spirit lamp going and taking up her newspaper stood waiting to make tea  it was the hour of the day most dear to her if the dew had been brushed off her life it was still out there every morning on the face of nature and on the faces of her flowers there was before her all the pleasure of seeing how each of those little creatures in the garden had slept how many children had been born since the dawn who was ailing and needed attention there was also the feeling which renews itself every morning in people who live lonely lives that they are not lonely until the day wearing on assures them of the fact not that she was idle for she had obtained through courtier the work of reviewing music in a womans paper for which she was intuitively fitted this her flowers her own music and the affairs of certain families of cottagers filled nearly all her time and she asked no better fate than to have every minute occupied having that passion for work requiring no initiation which is natural to the owners of lazy minds  suddenly she dropped her newspaper went to the bowl of flowers on the breakfasttable and plucked forth two stalks of lavender holding them away from her she went out into the garden and flung them over the wall  this strange immolation of those two poor sprigs born so early gathered and placed before her with such kind intention by her maid seemed of all acts the least to be expected of one who hated to hurt peoples feelings and whose eyes always shone at the sight of flowers but in truth the smell of lavenderthat scent carried on her husbands handkerchief and clothesstill affected her so strongly that she could not bear to be in a room with it as nothing else did it brought before her one to live with whom had slowly become torture and freed by that scent the whole flood of memory broke in on her the memory of three years when her teeth had been set doggedly on her discovery that she was chained to unhappiness for life the memory of the abrupt end and of her creeping away to let her scorched nerves recover of how during the first year of this release which was not freedom she had twice changed her abode to get away from her own storynot because she was ashamed of it but because it reminded her of wretchedness of how she had then come to monkland where the quiet life had slowly given her elasticity again and then of her meeting with miltoun the unexpected delight of that companionship the frank enjoyment of the first four months and she remembered all her secret rejoicing her silent identification of another life with her own before she acknowledged or even suspected love and just three weeks ago now helping to tie up her roses he had touched her and she had known but even then until the night of courtiers accident she had not dared to realize more concerned now for him than for herself she asked herself a thousand times if she had been to blame she had let him grow fond of her a woman out of court a dead woman an unpardonable sin yet surely that depended on what she was prepared to give and she was frankly ready to give everything and ask for nothing he knew her position he had told her that he knew in her love for him she gloried would continue to glory would suffer for it without regret miltoun was right in believing that newspaper gossip was incapable of hurting her though her reasons for being so impervious were not what he supposed she was not like him secured from pain because such insinuations about the private affairs of others were mean and vulgar and beneath notice it had not as yet occurred to her to look at the matter in so lofty and general a light she simply was not hurt because she was already so deeply miltouns property in spirit that she was almost glad that they should assign him all the rest of her but for miltouns sake she was disturbed to the soul she had tarnished his shield in the eyes of men and for she was oddly practical and saw things in very clear proportion perhaps put back his career who knew how many years  she sat down to drink her tea not being a crying woman she suffered quietly she felt that miltoun would be coming to her she did not know at all what she should say when he did come he could not care for her so much as she cared for him he was a man men soon forget ah but he was not like most men one could not look at his eyes without feeling that he could suffer terribly in all this her own reputation concerned her not at all life and her clear way of looking at things had rooted in her the conviction that to a woman the preciousness of her reputation was a fiction invented by men entirely for mans benefit a secondhand fetish insidiously inevitably setup by men for worship in novels plays and lawcourts her instinct told her that men could not feel secure in the possession of their women unless they could believe that women set tremendous store by sexual reputation what they wanted to believe that they did believe but she knew otherwise such greatminded women as she had met or read of had always left on her the impression that reputation for them was a matter of the spirit having little to do with sex from her own feelings she knew that reputation for a simple woman meant to stand well in the eyes of him or her whom she loved best for worldly womenand there were so many kinds of those besides the merely fashionableshe had always noted that its value was not intrinsic but commercial not a crown of dignity but just a marketable asset she did not dread in the least what people might say of her friendship with miltoun nor did she feel at all that her indissoluble marriage forbade her loving him she had secretly felt free as soon as she had discovered that she had never really loved her husband she had only gone on dutifully until the separation from sheer passivity and because it was against her nature to cause pain to anyone the man who was still her husband was now as dead to her as if he had never been born she could not marry again it was true but she could and did love if that love was to be starved and die away it would not be because of any moral scruples  she opened her paper languidly and almost the first words she read under the heading of election news were these  apropos of the outrage on mr courtier we are requested to state that the lady who accompanied lord miltoun to the rescue of that gentleman was mrs lees noel wife of the rev stephen lees noel vicar of clathampton warwickshire  this dubious little daub of whitewash only brought a rather sad smile to her lips she left her tea and went out into the air there at the gate was miltoun coming in her heart leaped but she went forward quietly and greeted him with castdown eyes as if nothing were out of the ordinary     chapter xv  exaltation had not left miltoun his sallow face was flushed his eyes glowed with a sort of beauty and audrey noel who better than most women could read what was passing behind a face saw those eyes with the delight of a moth fluttering towards a lamp but in a very unemotional voice she said  so you have come to breakfast how nice of you  it was not in miltoun to observe the formalities of attack had he been going to fight a duel there would have been no preliminary just a look a bow and the swords crossed so in this first engagement of his with the soul of a woman  he neither sat down nor suffered her to sit but stood looking intently into her face and said  i love you  now that it had come with this disconcerting swiftness she was strangely calm and unashamed the elation of knowing for sure that she was loved was like a wand waving away all tremors stilling them to sweetness since nothing could take away that knowledge it seemed that she could never again be utterly unhappy then too in her nature so deeply unreasoningly incapable of perceiving the importance of any principle but love there was a secret feeling of assurance of triumph he did love her and she him well and suddenly panicstricken lest he should take back those words she put her hand up to his breast and said  and i love you  the feel of his arms round her the strength and passion of that moment were so terribly sweet that she died to thought just looking up at him with lips parted and eyes darker with the depth of her love than he had ever dreamed that eyes could be the madness of his own feeling kept him silent and they stood there so merged in one another that they knew and cared nothing for any other mortal thing it was very still in the room the roses and carnations in the lustre bowl seeming to know that their mistress was caught up into heaven had let their perfume steal forth and occupy every cranny of the abandoned air a hovering bee too circled round the lovers heads scenting it seemed the honey in their hearts  it has been said that miltouns face was not unhandsome for audrey noel at this moment when his eyes were so near hers and his lips touching her he was transfigured and had become the spirit of all beauty and she with heart beating fast against him her eyes half closing from delight and her hair asking to be praised with its fragrance her cheeks fainting pale with emotion and her arms too languid with happiness to embrace himshe to him was the incarnation of the woman that visits dreams  so passed that moment  the bee ended it who impatient with flowers that hid their honey so deep had entangled himself in audreys hair and then seeing that words those dreaded things were on his lips she tried to kiss them back but they came  when will you marry me  it all swayed a little and with marvellous rapidity the whole position started up before her she saw with preternatural insight into its nooks and corners something he had said one day when they were talking of the church view of marriage and divorce lighted all up so he had really never known about her at this moment of utter sickness she was saved from fainting by her sense of humourher cynicism not content to let her be peoples tongues had divorced her he had believed them and the crown of irony was that he should want to marry her when she felt so utterly so sacredly his to do what he liked with sans forms or ceremonies a surge of bitter feeling against the man who stood between her and miltoun almost made her cry out that man had captured her before she knew the world or her own soul and she was tied to him till by some beneficent chance he drew his last breath when her hair was grey and her eyes had no love light and her cheeks no longer grew pale when they were kissed when twilight had fallen and the flowers and bees no longer cared for her  it was that feeling the sudden revolt of the desperate prisoner which steeled her to put out her hand take up the paper and give it to miltoun  when he had read the little paragraph there followed one of those eternities which last perhaps two minutes  he said then  its true i suppose and at her silence added i am sorry  this queer dry saying was so much more terrible than any outcry that she remained deprived even of the power of breathing with her eyes still fixed on miltouns face  the smile of the old cardinal had come up there and was to her like a living accusation it seemed strange that the hum of the bees and flies and the gentle swishing of the limetree should still go on outside insisting that there was a world moving and breathing apart from her and careless of her misery then some of her courage came back and with it her womans mute power it came haunting about her face perfectly still about her lips sensitive and drawn about her eyes dark almost mutinous under their arched brows she stood drawing him with silence and beauty  at last he spoke  i have made a foolish mistake it seems i believed you were free  her lips just moved for the words to pass i thought you knew i never dreamed you would want to marry me  it seemed to her natural that he should be thinking only of himself but with the subtlest defensive instinct she put forward her own tragedy  i suppose i had got too used to knowing i was dead  is there no release  none we have neither of us done wrong besides with him marriage isfor ever  my god  she had broken his smile which had been cruel without meaning to be cruel and with a smile of her own that was cruel too she said  i didnt know that you believed in release either  then as though she had stabbed herself in stabbing him her face quivered  he looked at her now conscious at last that she was suffering and she felt that he was holding himself in with all his might from taking her again into his arms seeing this the warmth crept back to her lips and a little light into her eyes which she kept hidden from him though she stood so proudly still some wistful force was coming from her as from a magnet and miltouns hands and arms and face twitched as though palsied this struggle dumb and pitiful seemed never to be coming to an end in the little white room darkened by the thatch of the verandah and sweet with the scent of pinks and of a wood fire just lighted somewhere out at the back then without a word he turned and went out she heard the wicket gate swing to he was gone     chapter xvi  lord denis was flyfishingthe weather just too bright to allow the little trout of that shallow never silent stream to embrace with avidity the small enticements which he threw in their direction nevertheless he continued to invite them exploring every nook of their watery pathway with his softswishing line in a rough suit and battered hat adorned with those artificial and other flies which infest harris tweed he crept along among the hazel bushes and thorntrees perfectly happy like an old spaniel who has once gloried in the fetching of hares rabbits and all manner of fowl and is now glad if you will but throw a stick for him so one who had been a famous fisher before the lord who had harried the waters of scotland and norway florida and iceland now pursued trout no bigger than sardines the glamour of a thousand memories hallowed the hours he thus spent by that brown water he fished unhasting religious like some good catholic adding one more to the row of beads already told as though he would fish himself gravely without complaint into the other world with each fish caught he experienced a solemn satisfaction  though he would have liked barbara with him that morning he had only looked at her once after breakfast in such a way that she could not see him and with a dry smile gone off by himself down by the stream it was dappled both cool and warm windless the trees met over the river and there were many stones forming little basins which held up the ripple so that the casting of a fly required much cunning this long dingle ran for miles through the footgrowth of folding hills it was beloved of jays but of human beings there were none except a chickenfarmers widow who lived in a house thatched almost to the ground and made her livelihood by directing tourists with such cunning that they soon came back to her for tea  it was while throwing a rather longer line than usual to reach a little dark piece of crisp water that lord dennis heard the swishing and crackling of someone advancing at full speed he frowned slightly feeling for the nerves of his fishes whom he did not wish startled the invader was miltoun hot pale dishevelled with a queer hunted look on his face he stopped on seeing his greatuncle and instantly assumed the mask of his smile  lord dennis was not the man to see what was not intended for him and he merely said  well eustace as he might have spoken meeting his nephew in the hall of one of his london clubs  miltoun no less polite murmured  hope i havent lost you anything  lord dennis shook his head and laying his rod on the bank said  sit down and have a chat old fellow you dont fish i think  he had not in the least missed the suffering behind miltouns mask his eyes were still good and there was a little matter of some twenty years suffering of his own on account of a womanancient history nowwhich had left him quaintly sensitive for an old man to signs of suffering in others  miltoun would not have obeyed that invitation from anyone else but there was something about lord dennis which people did not resist his power lay in a dry ironic suavity which could not but persuade people that impoliteness was altogether too new and raw a thing to be indulged in  the two sat side by side on the roots of trees at first they talked a little of birds and then were dumb so dumb that the invisible creatures of the woods consulted together audibly lord dennis broke that silence  this place he said always reminds me of mark twains writingscant tell why unless its the evergreenness i like the evergreen philosophers twain and meredith theres no salvation except through courage though i never could stomach the strong mancaptain of his soul henley and nietzsche and that sortgoes against the grain with me what do you say eustace  they meant well answered miltoun but they protested too much  lord dennis moved his head in assent  to be captain of your soul continued miltoun in a bitter voice its a pretty phrase  pretty enough murmured lord dennis  miltoun looked at him  and suitable to you he said  no my dear lord dennis answered dryly a long way off that thank god  his eyes were fixed intently on the place where a large trout had risen in the stillest toffeecoloured pool he knew that fellow a halfpounder at least and his thoughts began flighting round the top of his head hovering over the various merits of the flies his fingers itched too but he made no movement and the ashtree under which he sat let its leaves tremble as though in sympathy  see that hawk said miltoun  at a height more than level with the tops of the hills a buzzard hawk was stationary in the blue directly over them inspired by curiosity at their stillness he was looking down to see whether they were edible the upcurved ends of his great wings flirted just once to show that he was part of the living glory of the aira symbol of freedom to men and fishes  lord dennis looked at his greatnephew the boyfor what else was thirty to seventysixwas taking it hard whatever it might be taking it very hard he was that sortran till he dropped the worst kind to helpthe sort that made for troublethat let things gnaw at them and there flashed before the old mans mind the image of prometheus devoured by the eagle it was his favourite tragedy which he still read periodically in the greek helping himself now and then out of his old lexicon to the meaning of some word which had flown to erebus yes eustace was a fellow for the heights and depths  he said quietly  you dont care to talk about it i suppose  miltoun shook his head and again there was silence  the buzzard hawk having seen them move quivered his wings like a moths and deserted that plane of air a robin from the dappled warmth of a mossy stone was regarding them instead there was another splash in the pool  lord dennis said gently  that fellows risen twice i believe hed take a wistmans treasure extracting from his hat its latest fly and binding it on he began softly to swish his line  i shall have him yet he muttered but miltoun had stolen away  the further piece of information about mrs noel already known by barbara and diffused by the bucklandbury news had not become common knowledge at the court till after lord dennis had started out to fish in combination with the report that miltoun had arrived and gone out without breakfast it had been received with mingled feelings bertie harbinger and shropton in a short conclave after agreeing that from the point of view of the election it was perhaps better than if she had been a divorcee were still inclined to the belief that no time was to be lostin doing what however they were unable to determine apart from the impossibility of knowing how a fellow like miltoun would take the matter they were faced with the devilish subtlety of all situations to which the proverb least said soonest mended applies they were in the presence of that aweinspiring thing the power of scandal simple statements of simple facts without moral drawn to which no legal exception could be taken laid before the public as pieces of interesting information or at the worst exposed in perfect good faith lest the public should blindly elect as their representative one whose private life might not stand the inspection of daylightwhat could be more justifiable and yet miltouns supporters knew that this simple statement of where he spent his evenings had a poisonous potency through its power of stimulating that side of the human imagination the most easily excited they recognized only too well how strong was a certain primitive desire especially in rural districts by yielding to which the world was made to go and how remarkably hard it was not to yield to it and how interesting and exciting to see or hear of others yielding to it and how though here of course men might differ secretly reprehensible of them to do so they recognized too well how a certain kind of conscience would appreciate this rumour and how the puritans would lick their lengthened chops they knew too how irresistible to people of any imagination at all was the mere combination of a member of a class traditionally supposed to be inclined to having what it wanted with a lady who lived alone as harbinger said it was really devilish awkward for to take any notice of it would be to make more people than ever believe it true and yet that it was working mischief they felt by the secret voice in their own souls telling them that they would have believed it if they had not known better they hung about waiting for miltoun to come in  the news was received by lady valleys with a sigh of intense relief and the remark that it was probably another lie when barbara confirmed it she only said poor eustace and at once wrote off to her husband to say that anonyma was still married so that the worst fortunately could not happen  miltoun came in to lunch but from his face and manner nothing could be guessed he was a thought more talkative than usual and spoke of brabrooks speechsome of which he had heard he looked at courtier meaningly and after lunch said to him  will you come round to my den  in that room the old withdrawingroom of the elizabethan wingwhere once had been the embroideries tapestries and missals of beruffled dames were now books pamphlets oakpanels pipes fencing gear and along one wall a collection of red indian weapons and ornaments brought back by miltoun from the united states high on the wall above these reigned the bronze deathmask of a famous apache chief cast from a plaster taken of the face by a professor of yale college who had declared it to be a perfect specimen of the vanishing race that visage which had a certain weird resemblance to dantes presided over the room with cruel tragic stoicism no one could look on it without feeling that there the human will had been pushed to its farthest limits of endurance  seeing it for the first time courtier said  fine thingthat only wants a soul  miltoun nodded  sit down he said  courtier sat down  there followed one of those silences in which men whose spirits though different have a certain bigness in commoncan say so much to one another  at last miltoun spoke  i have been living in the clouds it seems you are her oldest friend the immediate question is how to make it easiest for her in face of this miserable rumour  not even courtier himself could have put such whiplash sting into the word miserable  he answered  oh take no notice of that let them stew in their own juice she wont care  miltoun listened not moving a muscle of his face  your friends here went on courtier with a touch of contempt seem in a flutter dont let them do anything dont let them say a word treat the thing as it deserves to be treated itll die  miltoun however smiled  im not sure he said that the consequences will be as you think but i shall do as you say  as for your candidature any man with a spark of generosity in his soul will rally to you because of it  possibly said miltoun it will lose me the election for all that  then dimly conscious that their last words had revealed the difference of their temperaments and creeds they stared at one another  no said courtier i never will believe that people can be so mean  until they are  anyway though we get at it in different ways we agree  miltoun leaned his elbow on the mantelpiece and shading his face with his hand said  you know her story is there any way out of that for her  on courtiers face was the look which so often came when he was speaking for one of his lost causesas if the fumes from a fire in his heart had mounted to his head  only the way he answered calmly that i should take if i were you  and that  the law into your own hands  miltoun unshaded his face his gaze seemed to have to travel from an immense distance before it reached courtier he answered  yes i thought you would say that     chapter xvii  when everything that night was quiet barbara her hair hanging loose outside her dressing gown slipped from her room into the dim corridor with bare feet thrust into furcrowned slippers which made no noise she stole along looking at door after door through a long gothic window uncurtained the mild moonlight was coming she stopped just where that moonlight fell and tapped there came no answer she opened the door a little way and said  are you asleep eusty  there still came no answer and she went in  the curtains were drawn but a chink of moonlight peering through fell on the bed this was empty barbara stood uncertain listening in the heart of that darkness there seemed to be not sound but as it were the muffled soul of sound a sort of strange vibration like that of a flame noiselessly licking the air she put her hand to her heart which beat as though it would leap through the thin silk covering from what corner of the room was that mute tremor coming stealing to the window she parted the curtains and stared back into the shadows there on the far side lying on the floor with his arms pressed tightly round his head and his face to the wall was miltoun barbara let fall the curtains and stood breathless with such a queer sensation in her breast as she had never felt a sense of something outragedof scarred pride it was gone at once in a rush of pity she stepped forward quickly in the darkness was visited by fear and stopped he had seemed absolutely himself all the evening a little more talkative perhaps a little more caustic than usual and now to find him like this there was no great share of reverence in barbara but what little she possessed had always been kept for her eldest brother he had impressed her from a child with his aloofness and she had been proud of kissing him because he never seemed to let anybody else do so those caresses no doubt had the savour of conquest his face had been the undiscovered land for her lips she loved him as one loves that which ministers to ones pride had for him too a touch of motherly protection as for a doll that does not get on too well with the other dolls and withal a little unaccustomed awe  dared she now plunge in on this private agony could she have borne that anyone should see herself thus prostrate he had not heard her and she tried to regain the door but a board creaked she heard him move and flinging away her fears said its me babs and dropped on her knees beside him if it had not been so pitch dark she could never have done that she tried at once to take his head into her arms but could not see it and succeeded indifferently she could but stroke his arm continually wondering whether he would hate her ever afterwards and blessing the darkness which made it all seem as though it were not happening yet so much more poignant than if it had happened suddenly she felt him slip away from her and getting up stole out after the darkness of that room the corridor seemed full of grey filmy light as though dreamspiders had joined the walls with their cobwebs in which innumerable white moths so tiny that they could not be seen were struggling small eerie noises crept about a sudden frightened longing for warmth and light and colour came to barbara she fled back to her room but she could not sleep that terrible mute unseen vibration in the unlighted roomlike the noiseless licking of a flame at bland air the touch of miltouns hand hot as fire against her cheek and neck the whole tremulous dark episode possessed her through and through thus had the wayward force of love chosen to manifest itself to her in all its wistful violence at this fiat sight of the red flower of passion her cheeks burned up and down her between the cool sheets little hot cruel shivers ran she lay wideeyed staring at the ceiling she thought of the woman whom he so loved and wondered if she too were lying sleepless flung down on a bare floor trying to cool her forehead and lips against a cold wall  not for hours did she fall asleep and then dreamed of running desperately through fields full of tall spiky asphodellike flowers and behind her was running herself  in the morning she dreaded to go down could she meet miltoun now that she knew of the passion in him and he knew that she knew it she had her breakfast brought upstairs before she had finished miltoun himself came in he looked more than usually selfcontained not to say ironic and only remarked if youre going to ride you might take this note for me over to old haliday at wippincott by his coming she knew that he was saying all he ever meant to say about that dark incident and sympathizing completely with a reticence which she herself felt to be the only possible way out for both of them barbara looked at him gratefully took the note and said all right  then after glancing once or twice round the room miltoun went away  he left her restless divested of the cloak of course in a strange mood of questioning ready as it were for the sight of the magpie wings of life and to hear their quick flutterings talk jarred on her that morning with its sameness and attachment to the facts of the present and the future its essential concern with the world as it wasshe avoided all companionship on her ride she wanted to be told of things that were not yet might be to peep behind the curtain and see the very spirit of mortal happenings escaped from prison and this was all so unusual with barbara whose body was too perfect too sanely governed by the flow of her blood not to revel in the moment and the things thereof she knew it was unusual after her ride she avoided lunch and walked out into the lanes but about two oclock feeling very hungry she went into a farmhouse and asked for milk there in the kitchen like young jackdaws in a row with their mouths a little open were the three farm boys seated on a bench gripped to the alcove of the great fireway munching bread and cheese above their heads a gun was hung trigger upwards and two hams were mellowing in the smoke at the feet of a blackhaired girl who was slicing onions lay a sheep dog of tremendous age with nose stretched out on paws and in his little blue eyes a gleam of approaching immortality they all stared at barbara and one of the boys whose face had the delightful look of him who loses all sense of other things in what he is seeing at the moment smiled and continued smiling with sheer pleasure barbara drank her milk and wandered out again passing through a gate at the bottom of a steep rocky tor she sat down on a sunwarmed stone the sunlight fell greedily on her here like an invisible swift hand touching her all over and specially caressing her throat and face a very gentle wind which dived over the tor tops into the young fern stole down at her spiced with the fern sap all was warmth and peace and only the cuckoos on the far thorn treesas though stationed by the wistful master himselfwere there to disturb her heart but all the sweetness and piping of the day did not soothe her in truth she could not have said what was the matter except that she felt so discontented and as it were empty of all but a sort of aching impatience withwhat exactly she could not say she had that rather dreadful feeling of something slipping by which she could not catch it was so new to her to feel like thatfor no girl was less given to moods and repinings and all the time a sort of contempt for this soft and almost sentimental feeling made her tighten her lips and frown she felt distrustful and sarcastic towards a mood so utterly subversive of that fetich hardness to the unconscious worship of which she had been brought up to stand no sentiment or nonsense either in herself or others was the first article of faith not to slopover anywhere so that to feel as she did was almost horrible to barbara yet she could not get rid of the sensation with sudden recklessness she tried giving herself up to it entirely undoing the scarf at her throat she let the air play on her bared neck and stretched out her arms as if to hug the wind to her then with a sigh she got up and walked on and now she began thinking of anonyma turning her position over and over the idea that anyone young and beautiful should thus be clipped off in her life roused her impatient indignation let them try it with her they would soon see for all her cultivated hardness barbara really hated anything to suffer it seemed to her unnatural she never went to that hospital where lady valleys had a ward nor to their summer camp for crippled children nor to help in their annual concert for sweated workers without a feeling of such vehement pity that it was like being seized by the throat once when she had been singing to them the rows of wan pinched faces below had been too much for her she had broken down forgotten her words lost memory of the tune and just ended her performance with a smile worth more perhaps to her audience than those lost verses she never came away from such sights and places without a feeling of revolt amounting almost to rage and she only continued to go because she dimly knew that it was expected of her not to turn her back on such things in her section of society  but it was not this feeling which made her stop before mrs noels cottage nor was it curiosity it was a quite simple desire to squeeze her hand  anonyma seemed taking her trouble as only those women who are no good at selfassertion can take thingsdoing exactly as she would have done if nothing had happened a little paler than usual with lips pressed rather tightly together  they neither of them spoke at first but stood looking not at each others faces but at each others breasts at last barbara stepped forward impulsively and kissed her  after that like two children who kiss first and then make acquaintance they stood apart silent faintly smiling it had been given and returned in real sweetness and comradeship that kiss for a sign of womanhood making face against the world but now that it was over both felt a little awkward would that kiss have been given if fate had been auspicious was it not proof of misery so mrs noels smile seemed saying and barbaras smile unwillingly admitted perceiving that if they talked it could only be about the most ordinary things they began speaking of music flowers and the queerness of bees legs but all the time barbara though seemingly unconscious was noting with her smiling eyes the tiny movements by which one woman can tell what is passing in another she saw a little quiver tighten the corner of the lips the eyes suddenly grow large and dark the thin blouse desperately rise and fall and her fancy quickened by last nights memory saw this woman giving herself up to the memory of love in her thoughts at this sight she felt a little of that impatience which the conquering feel for the passive and perhaps just a touch of jealousy  whatever miltoun decided that would this woman accept such resignation while it simplified things offended the part of barbara which rebelled against all inaction all dictation even from her favourite brother she said suddenly  are you going to do nothing arent you going to try and free yourself if i were in your position i would never rest till id made them free me  but mrs noel did not answer and sweeping her glance from that crown of soft dark hair down the soft white figure to the very feet barbara cried  i believe you are a fatalist  soon after that not knowing what more to say she went away but walking home across the fields where full summer was swinging on the delicious air and there was now no bull but only red cows to crop short the milkmaids and buttercups she suffered from this strange revelation of the strength of softness and passivityas though she had seen in the white figure of anonyma and heard in her voice something from beyond symbolic inconceivable yet real     chapter xviii  lord valleys relieved from official pressure by subsidence of the war scare had returned for a long weekend to say that he had been intensely relieved by the news that mrs noel was not free would be to put it mildly though not oldfashioned like his motherinlaw in regard to the mixing of the castes prepared to admit that exclusiveness was out of date to pass over with a shrug and a laugh those numerous alliances by which his order were renewing the sinews of war and indeed in his capacity of an expert often pointing out the dangers of too much inbreedingyet he had a peculiar personal feeling about his own family and was perhaps a little extra sensitive because of agatha for shropton though a good fellow and extremely wealthy was only a third baronet and had originally been made of iron it was inadvisable to go outside the inner circle where there was no material necessity for so doing he had not done it himself moreover there was a sentiment about these things  on the morning after his arrival visiting the kennels before breakfast he stood chatting with his head man and caressing the wet noses of his two favourite pointerswith something of the feeling of a boy let out of school those pleasant creatures cowering and quivering with pride against his legs and turning up at him their yellow chinese eyes gave him that sense of warmth and comfort which visits men in the presence of their hobbies with this particular pair inbred to the uttermost he had successfully surmounted a great risk it was now touch and go whether he dared venture on one more cross to the original strain in the hope of eliminating the last clinging of liver colour it was a gambleand it was just that which rendered it so vastly interesting  a small voice diverted his attention he looked round and saw little ann she had been in bed when he arrived the night before and he was therefore the newest thing about  she carried in her arms a guineapig and began at once  grandpapa granny wants you shes on the terrace shes talking to mr courtier i like himhes a kind man if i put my guineapig down will they bite it poor darlingthey shant isnt it a darling  lord valleys twirling his moustache regarded the guineapig without favour he had rather a dislike for all senseless kinds of beasts  pressing the guineapig between her hands as it might be a concertina little ann jigged it gently above the pointers who wrinkling horribly their long noses gazed upwards fascinated  poor darlings they want itdont they grandpapa  yes  do you think the next puppies will be spotted quite all over  continuing to twirl his moustache lord valleys answered  i think it is not improbable ann  why do you like them spotted like that oh theyre kissing samboi must go  lord valleys followed her his eyebrows a little raised  as he approached the terrace his wife came towards him her colour was deeper than usual and she had the look higher and more resolute peculiar to her when she had been opposed in truth she had just been through a passage of arms with courtier who as the first revealer of mrs noels situation had become entitled to a certain confidence on this subject it had arisen from what she had intended as a perfectly natural and not unkind remark to the effect that all the trouble had come from mrs noel not having made her position clear to miltoun from the first  he had at once grown very red  its easy lady valleys for those who have never been in the position of a lonely woman to blame her  unaccustomed to be withstood she had looked at him intently  i am the last person to be hard on a woman for conventional reasons but i think it showed lack of character  courtiers reply had been almost rude  plants are not equally robust lady valleys some as we know are actually sensitive  she had retorted with decision  if you like to so dignify the simpler word weak  he had become very rigid at that biting deeply into his moustache  what crimes are not committed under the sanctity of that creed survival of the fittest which suits the book of all you fortunate people so well  priding herself on her restraint lady valleys answered  ah we must talk that out on the face of them your words sound a little unphilosophic dont they  he had looked straight at her with a queer unpleasant smile and she had felt at once disturbed and angry it was all very well to pet and even to admire these original sort of men but there were limits remembering however that he was her guest she had only said  perhaps after all we had better not talk it out and moving away she heard him answer in any case im certain audrey noel never wilfully kept your son in the dark shes much too proud  though rude she could not help liking the way he stuck up for this woman and she threw back at him the words  you and i mr courtier must have a good fight some day  she went towards her husband conscious of the rather pleasurable sensation which combat always roused in her  these two were very good comrades theirs had been a love match and making due allowance for human nature beset by opportunity had remained throughout a solid and efficient alliance taking as they both did such prominent parts in public and social matters the time they spent together was limited but productive of mutual benefit and reinforcement they had not yet had an opportunity of discussing their sons affair and slipping her hand through his arm lady valleys drew him away from the house  i want to talk to you about miltoun geoff  hm said lord valleys yes the boys looking worn good thing when this elections over  if hes beaten and hasnt something new and serious to concentrate himself on hell fret his heart out over that woman  lord valleys meditated a little before replying  i dont think that gertrude hes got plenty of spirit  of course but its a real passion and you know hes not like most boys wholl take what they can  she said this rather wistfully  im sorry for the woman mused lord valleys i really am  they say this rumours done a lot of harm  our influence is strong enough to survive that  itll be a squeak i wish i knew what he was going to do will you ask him  youre clearly the person to speak to him replied lord valleys im no hand at that sort of thing  but lady valleys with genuine discomfort murmured  my dear im so nervous with eustace when he puts on that smile of his im done for at once  this is obviously a womans business nobody like a mother  if it were only one of the others muttered lady valleys eustace has that queer way of making you feel lumpy  lord valleys looked at her askance he had that kind of critical fastidiousness which a word will rouse into activity was she lumpy the idea had never struck him  well ill do it if i must sighed lady valleys  when after breakfast she entered miltouns den he was buckling on his spurs preparatory to riding out to some of the remoter villages under the mask of the apache chief bertie was standing more inscrutable and neat than ever in a perfectly tied cravatte perfectly cut riding breeches and boots worn and polished till a sooty glow shone through their natural russet not specially dandified in his usual dress bertie caradoc would almost sooner have died than disgrace a horse his eyes the sharper because they had only half the space of the ordinary eye to glance from at once took in the fact that his mother wished to be alone with old miltoun and he discreetly left the room  that which disconcerted all who had dealings with miltoun was the discovery made soon or late that they could not be sure how anything would strike him in his mind as in his face there was a certain regularity and thenimpossible to say exactly whereit would shoot off and twist round a corner this was the legacy no doubt of the hardbitten individuality which had brought to the front so many of his ancestors for in miltoun was the blood not only of the caradocs and fitzharolds but of most other prominent families in the kingdom all of whom in those ages before money made the man must have had a forbear conspicuous by reason of qualities not always fine but always poignant  and now though lady valleys had the audacity of her physique and was not customarily abashed she began by speaking of politics hoping her son would give her an opening but he gave her none and she grew nervous at last summoning all her coolness she said  im dreadfully sorry about this affair dear boy your father told me of your talk with him try not to take it too hard  miltoun did not answer and silence being that which lady valleys habitually most dreaded she took refuge in further speech outlining for her son the whole episode as she saw it from her point of view and ending with these words  surely its not worth it  miltoun heard her with his peculiar look as of a man peering through a vizor then smiling he said  thank you and opened the door  lady valleys without quite knowing whether he intended her to do so indeed without quite knowing anything at the moment passed out and miltoun closed the door behind her  ten minutes later he and bertie were seen riding down the drive     chapter xix  that afternoon the wind which had been rising steadily brought a flurry of clouds up from the southwest formed out on the heart of the atlantic they sailed forward swift and fleecy at first like the skirmishing white shallops of a great fleet then in serried masses darkened the sun about four oclock they broke in rain which the wind drove horizontally with a cold whiffling murmur as youth and glamour die in a face before the cold rains of life so glory died on the moor the tors from being uplifted wild castles became mere grey excrescences distance failed the cuckoos were silent there was none of the beauty that there is in death no tragic greatnessall was moaning and monotony but about seven the sun tore its way back through the swathe and flared out like some huge star whose rays were stretching down to the horizon and up to the very top of the hill of air it shone with an amazing murky glamour the clouds splintered by its shafts and tinged saffron piled themselves up as if in wonder under the sultry warmth of this new great star the heather began to steam a little and the glitter of its wet unopened bells was like that of innumerable tiny smoking fires the two brothers were drenched as they cantered silently home good friends always they had never much to say to one another for miltoun was conscious that he thought on a different plane from bertie and bertie grudged even to his brother any inkling of what was passing in his spirit just as he grudged parting with diplomatic knowledge or stable secrets or indeed anything that might leave him less in command of life he grudged it because in a private sort of way it lowered his estimation of his own stoical selfsufficiency it hurt something proud in the withdrawingroom of his soul but though he talked little he had the power of contemplationoften found in men of decided character with a tendency to liver once in nepal where he had gone to shoot he had passed a month quite happily with only a ghoorka servant who could speak no english to those who asked him if he had not been horribly bored he had always answered not a bit did a lot of thinking  with miltouns trouble he had the professional sympathy of a brother and the natural intolerance of a confirmed bachelor women were to him very kittlecattle he distrusted from the bottom of his soul those who had such manifest power to draw things from you he was one of those men in whom some day a woman might awaken a really fine affection but who until that time would maintain the perfectly male attitude to the entire sex and after it to all the sex but one women were like life itself creatures to be watched carefully used and kept duly subservient the only allusion therefore that he made to miltouns trouble was very sudden  old man i hope youre going to cut your losses  the words were followed by undisturbed silence but passing mrs noels cottage miltoun said  take my horse on i want to go in here  she was sitting at her piano with her hands idle looking at a line of music she had been sitting thus for many minutes but had not yet taken in the notes  when miltouns shadow blotted the light by which she was seeing so little she gave a slight start and got up but she neither went towards him nor spoke and he without a word came in and stood by the hearth looking down at the empty grate a tortoiseshell cat which had been watching swallows disturbed by his entrance withdrew from the window beneath a chair  this silence in which the question of their future lives was to be decided seemed to both interminable yet neither could end it  at last touching his sleeve she said youre wet  miltoun shivered at that timid sign of possession and they again stood in silence broken only by the sound of the cat licking its paws  but her faculty for dumbness was stronger than his andhe had to speak first  forgive me for coming something must be settled thisrumour  oh that she said is there anything i can do to stop the harm to you  it was the turn of miltouns lips to curl god no let them talk  their eyes had come together now and once together seemed unable to part  mrs noel said at last  will you ever forgive me  what forit was my fault  no i should have known you better  the depth of meaning in those wordsthe tremendous and subtle admission they contained of all that she had been ready to do the despairing knowledge in them that he was not and never had been ready to bear it out even to the edge of doommade miltoun wince away  it is not from fearbelieve that anyway  i do  there followed another long long silence but though so close that they were almost touching they no longer looked at one another then miltoun said  there is only to say goodbye then  at those clear words spoken by lips which though just smiling failed so utterly to hide his misery mrs noels face became colourless as her white gown but her eyes which had grown immense seemed from the sheer lack of all other colour to have drawn into them the whole of her vitality to be pouring forth a proud and mournful reproach  shivering and crushing himself together with his arms miltoun walked towards the window there was not the faintest sound from her and he looked back she was following him with her eyes he threw his hand up over his face and went quickly out mrs noel stood for a little while where he had left her then sitting down once more at the piano began again to con over the line of music and the cat stole back to the window to watch the swallows the sunlight was dying slowly on the top branches of the limetree a drizzling rain began to fall     chapter xx  claud fresnay viscount harbinger was at the age of thirtyone perhaps the least encumbered peer in the united kingdom thanks to an ancestor who had acquired land and departed this life one hundred and thirty years before the town of nettlefold was built on a small portion of it and to a father who had died in his sons infancy after judiciously selling the said town he possessed a very large income independently of his landed interests tall and wellbuilt with handsome stronglymarked features he gave at first sight an impression of strengthwhich faded somewhat when he began to talk it was not so much the manner of his speechwith its rapid slang and its way of turning everything to a jestas the feeling it produced that the brain behind it took naturally the path of least resistance he was in fact one of those personalities who are often enough prominent in politics and social life by reason of their appearance position assurance and of a certain energy half genuine and half mere inherent predilection for short cuts certainly he was not idle had written a book travelled was a captain of yeomanry a justice of the peace a good cricketer and a constant and glib speaker it would have been unfair to call his enthusiasm for social reform spurious it was real enough in its way and did certainly testify that he was not altogether lacking either in imagination or goodheartedness but it was over and overlaid with the publicschool habitthat peculiar extraordinarily english habit so powerful and beguiling that it becomes a second nature stronger than the firstof relating everything in the universe to the standards and prejudices of a single class since practically all his intimate associates were immersed in it he was naturally not in the least conscious of this habit indeed there was nothing he deprecated so much in politics as the narrow and prejudiced outlook such as he had observed in the nonconformist or labour politician he would never have admitted for a moment that certain doors had been bangedto at his birth bolted when he went to eton and padlocked at cambridge no one would have denied that there was much that was valuable in his standardsa high level of honesty candour sportsmanship personal cleanliness and selfreliance together with a dislike of such cruelty as had been officially so to speak recognized as cruelty and a sense of public service to a state run by and for the public schools but it would have required far more originality than he possessed ever to look at life from any other point of view than that from which he had been born and bred to watch her to fully understand harbinger one must and with unprejudiced eyes and brain have attended one of those great cricket matches in which he had figured conspicuously as a boy and looking down from some high impartial spot have watched the ground at lunch time covered from rope to rope and stand to stand with a marvellous swarm all walking in precisely the same manner with precisely the same expression on their faces under precisely the same hatsa swarm enshrining the greatest identity of creed and habit ever known since the world began no his environment had not been favourable to originality moreover he was naturally rapid rather than deep and life hardly ever left him alone or left him silent brought into contact day and night with people to whom politics were more or less a game run after everywhere subjected to no form of disciplineit was a wonder that he was as serious as he was nor had he ever been in love until last year during her first season barbara had as he might have expressed itin the case of another bowled him middle stump though so deeply smitten he had not yet asked her to marry himhad not as it were had time nor perhaps quite the courage or conviction when he was near her it seemed impossible that he could go on longer without knowing his fate when he was away from her it was almost a relief because there were so many things to be done and said and so little time to do or say them in but now during this fortnight which for her sake he had devoted to miltouns cause his feeling had advanced beyond the point of comfort  he did not admit that the reason of this uneasiness was courtier for after all courtier was in a sense nobody and an extremist into the bargain and an extremist always affected the centre of harbingers anatomy causing it to give off a peculiar smile and tone of voice nevertheless his eyes whenever they fell on that sanguine steady ironic face shone with a sort of cold inquiry or were even darkened by the shade of fear they met seldom it is true for most of his day was spent in motoring and speaking and most of courtiers in writing and riding his leg being still too weak for walking but once or twice in the smoking room late at night he had embarked on some bantering discussion with the champion of lost causes and very soon an illconcealed impatience had crept into his voice why a man should waste his time flogging dead horses on a journey to the moon was incomprehensible facts were facts human nature would never be anything but human nature and it was peculiarly galling to see in courtiers eye a gleam to catch in his voice a tone as if he were thinking my young friend your soup is cold  on a morning after one of these encounters seeing barbara sally forth in riding clothes he asked if he too might go round the stables and started forth beside her unwontedly silent with an odd feeling about his heart and his throat unaccountably dry  the stables at monkland court were as large as many country houses accommodating thirty horses they were at present occupied by twentyone including the pony of little ann for height perfection of lighting gloss shine and purity of atmosphere they were unequalled in the county it seemed indeed impossible that any horse could ever so far forget himself in such a place as to remember that he was a horse every morning a little bin of carrots apples and lumps of sugar was set close to the main entrance ready for those who might desire to feed the dear inhabitants  reined up to a brass ring on either side of their stalls with their noses towards the doors they were always on view from nine to ten and would stand with their necks arched ears pricked and coats gleaming wondering about things soothed by the faint hissing of the still busy grooms and ready to move their noses up and down the moment they saw someone enter  in a large loosebox at the end of the north wing barbaras favourite chestnut hunter all but one saving sixteenth of whom had been entered in the stud book having heard her footstep was standing quite still with his neck turned he had been crumping up an apple placed amongst his feed and his senses struggled between the lingering flavour of that delicacyand the perception of a sound with which he connected carrots when she unlatched his door and said hal he at once went towards his manger to show his independence but when she said oh very well he turned round and came towards her his eyes which were full and of a soft brilliance under thick chestnut lashes explored her all over perceiving that her carrots were not in front he elongated his neck let his nose stray round her waist and gave her gauntletted hand a nip with his lips not tasting carrot he withdrew his nose and snuffled then stepping carefully so as not to tread on her foot he bunted her gently with his shoulder till with a quick manoeuvre he got behind her and breathed low and long on her neck even this did not smell of carrots and putting his muzzle over her shoulder against her cheek he slobbered a very little a carrot appeared about the level of her waist and hanging his head over he tried to reach it feeling it all firm and soft under his chin he snuffled again and gave her a gentle dig with his knee but still unable to reach the carrot he threw his head up withdrew and pretended not to see her and suddenly he felt two long substances round his neck and something soft against his nose he suffered this in silence laying his ears back the softness began puffing on his muzzle pricking his ears again he puffed back a little harder with more curiosity and the softness was withdrawn he perceived suddenly that he had a carrot in his mouth  harbinger had witnessed this episode oddly pale leaning against the loosebox wall he spoke as it came to an end  lady babs  the tone of his voice must have been as strange as it sounded to himself for barbara spun round  yes  how long am i going on like this  neither changing colour nor dropping her eyes she regarded him with a faintly inquisitive interest it was not a cruel look had not a trace of mischief or sex malice and yet it frightened him by its serene inscrutability impossible to tell what was going on behind it he took her hand bent over it and said in a low voice  you know what i feel dont be cruel to me  she did not pull away her hand it was as if she had not thought of it  i am not a bit cruel  looking up he saw her smiling  thenbabs  his face was close to hers but barbara did not shrink back she just shook her head and harbinger flushed up  why he asked and as though the enormous injustice of that rejecting gesture had suddenly struck him he dropped her hand  why he said again sharply  but the silence was only broken by the cheeping of sparrows outside the round window and the sound of the horse hal munching the last morsel of his carrot harbinger was aware in his every nerve of the sweetish slightly acrid husky odour of the loosebox mingling with the scent of barbaras hair and clothes and rather miserably he said for the third time  why  but folding her hands away behind her back she answered gently  my dear how should i know why  she was calmly exposed to his embrace if he had only dared but he did not dare and went back to the loosebox wall biting his finger he stared at her gloomily she was stroking the muzzle of her horse and a sort of dry rage began whisking and rustling in his heart she had refused himharbinger he had not known had not suspected how much he wanted her how could there be anybody else for him while that young calm sweetscented smiling thing lived to make his head go round his senses ache and to fill his heart with longing he seemed to himself at that moment the most unhappy of all men  i shall not give you up he muttered  barbaras answer was a smile faintly curious compassionate yet almost grateful as if she had said  thank youwho knows  and rather quickly a yard or so apart and talking of horses they returned to the house  it was about noon when accompanied by courtier she rode forth  the souwesterly spella matter of three dayshad given way before radiant stillness and merely to be alive was to feel emotion at a little stream running beside the moor under the wild stone man the riders stopped their horses just to listen and inhale the day the far sweet chorus of life was tuned to a most delicate rhythm not one of those small mingled pipings of streams and the lazy air of beasts men birds and bees jarred out too harshly through the garment of sound enwrapping the earth it was noonthe still momentbut this hymn to the sun after his too long absence never for a moment ceased to be murmured and the earth wore an underrobe of scent delicious very finely woven of the young fern sap heather buds larchtrees not yet odourless gorse just going brown drifted woodsmoke and the breath of hawthorn above earths twin vestments of sound and scent the blue enwrapping scarf of air that wistful wide champaign was spanned only by the wings of freedom  after that long drink of the day the riders mounted almost in silence to the very top of the moor there again they sat quite still on their horses examining the prospect far away to south and east lay the sea plainly visible two small groups of wild ponies were slowly grazing towards each other on the hillside below  courtier said in a low voice  thus will i sit and sing with love in my arms watching our two herds mingle together and below us the far divine cerulean sea  and after another silence looking steadily in barbaras face he added  lady barbara i am afraid this is the last time we shall be alone together while i have the chance therefore i must do homage you will always be the fixed star for my worship but your rays are too bright i shall worship from afar from your seventh heaven therefore look down on me with kindly eyes and do not quite forget me  under that speech so strangely compounded of irony and fervour barbara sat very still with glowing cheeks  yes said courtier only an immortal must embrace a goddess outside the purlieus of authority i shall sit crosslegged and prostrate myself three times a day  but barbara answered nothing  in the early morning went on courtier leaving the dark and dismal homes of freedom i shall look towards the temples of the great there with the eye of faith i shall see you  he stopped for barbaras lips were moving  dont hurt me please  courtier leaned over took her hand and put it to his lips we will now ride on  that night at dinner lord dennis seated opposite his greatniece was struck by her appearance  a very beautiful child he thought a most lovely young creature  she was placed between courtier and harbinger and the old mans still keen eyes carefully watched those two though attentive to their neighbours on the other side they were both of them keeping the corner of an eye on barbara and on each other the thing was transparent to lord dennis and a smile settled in that nest of gravity between his white peaked beard and moustaches but he waited the instinct of a fisherman bidding him to neglect no piece of water till he saw the child silent and in repose and watched carefully to see what would rise although she was so calmly so healthily eating her eyes stole round at courtier this quick look seemed to lord dennis perturbed as if something were exciting her then harbinger spoke and she turned to answer him her face was calm now faintly smiling a little eager provocative in its joy of life it made lord dennis think of his own youth what a splendid couple if babs married young harbinger there would not be a finer pair in all england his eyes travelled back to courtier manly enough they called him dangerous there was a look of effervescence carefully corked downmight perhaps be attractive to a girl to his essentially practical and sober mind a type like courtier was puzzling he liked the look of him but distrusted his ironic expression and that appearance of blood to the head fellowno doubtthat would ride off on his ideas humanitarian to lord dennis there was something queer about humanitarians they offended perhaps his dry and precise sense of form they were always looking out for cruelty or injustice seemed delighted when they found itswelled up as it were when they scented it and as there was a good deal about were never quite of normal size men who lived for ideas were in fact to one for whom facts sufficed always a little worrying a movement from barbara brought him back to actuality was the possessor of that crown of hair and those divine young shoulders the little babs who had ridden with him in the row time was certainly the devil her eyes were searching for something and following the direction of that glance lord dennis found himself observing miltoun what a difference between those two both no doubt in the great trouble of youth which sometimes as he knew too well lasted on almost to old age it was a curious look the child was giving her brother as if asking him to help her lord dennis had seen in his day many young creatures leave the shelter of their freedom and enter the house of the great lottery many who had drawn a prize and thereat lost forever the coldness of life many too the light of whose eyes had faded behind the shutters of that house having drawn a blank the thought of little babs on the threshold of that inexorable saloon filled him with an eager sadness and the sight of the two men watching for her waiting for her like hunters was to him distasteful in any case let her not for heavens sake go ranging as far as that red fellow of middle age who might have ideas but had no pedigree let her stick to youth and her own order and marry theyoung man confound him who looked like a greek god of the wrong period having grown a moustache he remembered her words the other evening about these two and the different lives they lived some romantic notion or other was working in her and again he looked at courtier a quixotic typethe sort that rode slapbang at everything all very wellbut not for babs she was not like the glorious garibaldis glorious anita it was truly characteristic of lord dennisand indeed of other peoplethat to him champions of liberty when dead were far dearer than champions of liberty when living yes babs would want more or was it less than just a life of sleeping under the stars for the man she loved and the cause he fought for she would want pleasure and not too much effort and presently a little power not the uncomfortable afterfame of a woman who went through fire but the fame and power of beauty and society prestige this fancy of hers if it were a fancy could be nothing but the romanticism of a young girl for the sake of a passing shadow to give up substance it wouldnt do and again lord dennis fixed his shrewd glance on his greatniece those eyes that smile yes she would grow out of this and take the greek god the dying gaulwhichever that young man was     chapter xxi  it was not till the morning of polling day itself that courtier left monkland court he had already suffered for some time from bad conscience for his knee was practically cured and he knew well that it was barbara and barbara alone who kept him staying there the atmosphere of that big house with its army of servants the impossibility of doing anything for himself and the feeling of hopeless insulation from the vivid and necessitous sides of life galled him greatly he felt a very genuine pity for these people who seemed to lead an existence as it were smothered under their own social importance it was not their fault he recognized that they did their best they were good specimens of their kind neither soft nor luxurious as things went in a degenerate and extravagant age they evidently tried to be simpleand this seemed to him to heighten the pathos of their situation fate had been too much for them what human spirit could emerge untrammelled and unshrunken from that great encompassing host of material advantage to a bedouin like courtier it was as though a subtle but very terrible tragedy was all the time being played before his eyes and in the very centre of this tragedy was the girl who so greatly attracted him every night when he retired to that lofty room which smelt so good and where without ostentation everything was so perfectly ordered for his comfort he thought  my god tomorrow ill be off  but every morning when he met her at breakfast his thought was precisely the same and there were moments when he caught himself wondering am i falling under the spell of this existenceam i getting soft he recognized as never before that the peculiar artificial hardness of the patrician was a brine or pickle in which with the instinct of selfpreservation they deliberately soaked themselves to prevent the decay of their overprotected fibre he perceived it even in barbaraa sort of sentimentproof overall a species of mistrust of the emotional or lyrical a kind of contempt of sympathy and feeling and every day he was more and more tempted to lay rude hands on this garment to see whether he could not make her catch fire and flare up with some emotion or idea in spite of her tantalizing youthful selfpossession he saw that she felt this longing in him and now and then he caught a glimpse of a streak of recklessness in her which lured him on  and yet when at last he was saying goodbye on the night before polling day he could not flatter himself that he had really struck any spark from her certainly she gave him no chance at that final interview but stood amongst the other women calm and smiling as if determined that he should not again mock her with his ironical devotion  he got up very early the next morning intending to pass away unseen in the car put at his disposal he found a small figure in a hollandfrock leaning back against the cushions so that some sandalled toes pointed up at the chauffeurs back they belonged to little ann who in the course of business had discovered the vehicle before the door her sudden little voice under her sudden little nose friendly but not too friendly was comforting to courtier  are you going i can come as far as the gate that is lucky  yes is that all your luggage  im afraid it is  oh its quite a lot really isnt it  as much as i deserve  of course you dont have to take guineapigs about with you  not as a rule  i always do theres greatgranny  there certainly was lady casterley standing a little back from the drive and directing a tall gardener how to deal with an old oaktree courtier alighted and went towards her to say goodbye she greeted him with a certain grim cordiality  so you are going i am glad of that though you quite understand that i like you personally  quite  her eyes gleamed maliciously  men who laugh like you are dangerous as ive told you before  then with great gravity she added  my granddaughter will marry lord harbinger i mention that mr courtier for your peace of mind you are a man of honour it will go no further  courtier bowing over her hand answered  he will be lucky  the little old lady regarded him unflinchingly  he will sir goodbye  courtier smilingly raised his hat his cheeks were burning regaining the car he looked round lady casterley was busy once more exhorting the tall gardener the voice of little ann broke in on his thoughts  i hope youll come again because i expect i shall be here at christmas and my brothers will be here then that is jock and tiddy not christopher because hes young i must go now goodbye hallo susie  courtier saw her slide away and join the little pale adoring figure of the lodgekeepers daughter  the car passed out into the lane  if lady casterley had planned this disclosure which indeed she had not for the impulse had only come over her at the sound of courtiers laugh she could not have devised one more effectual for there was deep down in him all a wanderers very real distrust amounting almost to contempt of people so settled and done for as aristocrats or bourgeois and all a man of actions horror of what he called puking and muling the pursuit of barbara with any other object but that of marriage had naturally not occurred to one who had little sense of conventional morality but much selfrespect and a secret endeavour to cut out harbinger ending in a marriage whereat he would figure as a sort of pirate was quite as little to the taste of a man not unaccustomed to think himself as good as other people  he caused the car to deviate up the lane that led to audrey noels hating to go away without a hail of cheer to that ship in distress  she came out to him on the verandah from the clasp of her hand thin and faintly brownedthe hand of a woman never quite idlehe felt that she relied on him to understand and sympathize and nothing so awakened the best in courtier as such mute appeals to his protection he said gently  dont let them think youre down and squeezing her hand hard why should you be wasted like this its a sin and shame  but he stopped in what he felt to be an unlucky speech at sight of her face which without movement expressed so much more than his words he was protesting as a civilized man her face was the protest of nature the soundless declaration of beauty wasted against its will beauty that was lifes invitation to the embrace which gave life birth  im clearing out myself he said you and i you know are not good for these people no birds of freedom allowed  pressing his hand she turned away into the house leaving courtier gazing at the patch of air where her white figure had stood he had always had a special protective feeling for audrey noel a feeling which with but little encouragement might have become something warmer but since she had been placed in her anomalous position he would not for the world have brushed the dew off her belief that she could trust him and now that he had fixed his own gaze elsewhere and she was in this bitter trouble he felt on her account the rancour that a brother feels when justice and pity have conspired to flout his sister the voice of frith the chauffeur roused him from gloomy reverie  lady barbara sir  following the mans eyes courtier saw against the skyline on the for above ashmans folly an equestrian statue he stopped the car at once and got out  he reached her at the ruin screened from the road by that divine chance which attends on men who take care that it shall he could not tell whether she knew of his approach and he would have given all he had which was not much to have seen through the stiff grey of her coat and the soft cream of her body into that mysterious cave her heart to have been for a moment like ashman done for good and all with material things and living the white life where are no barriers between man and woman the smile on her lips so baffled him puffed there by her spirit as a first flower is puffed through the sur face of earth to mock at the spring winds how tell what it signified yet he rather prided himself on his knowledge of women of whom he had seen something but all he found to say was  im glad of this chance  then suddenly looking up he found her strangely pale and quivering  i shall see you in london she said and touching her horse with her whip without looking back she rode away over the hill  courtier returned to the moor road and getting into the car muttered  faster please frith     chapter xxii  polling was already in brisk progress when courtier arrived in bucklandbury and partly from a not unnatural interest in the result partly from a halfunconscious clinging to the chance of catching another glimpse of barbara he took his bag to the hotel determined to stay for the announcement of the poll strolling out into the high street he began observing the humours of the day the bloom of political belief had long been brushed off the wings of one who had so flown the worlds winds he had seen too much of more vivid colours to be capable now of venerating greatly the dull and dubious tints of blue and yellow they left him feeling extremely philosophic yet it was impossible to get away from them for the very world that day seemed blue and yellow nor did the third colour of red adopted by both sides afford any clear assurance that either could see virtue in the other rather it seemed to symbolize the desire of each to have his enemys blood but courtier soon observed by the looks cast at his own detached and perhaps sarcastic face that even more hateful to either side than its antagonist was the philosophic eye unanimous was the longing to heave half a brick at it whenever it showed itself with its dd impartiality its habit of looking through the integument of things to see if there might be anything inside he felt that they regarded it as the real adversarythe eternal foe to all the little fat facts who dressed up in blue and yellow were swaggering and staggering calling each other names wiping each others eyes blooding each others noses to these little solemn delicious creatures all front and no behind the philosophic eye with its habit of looking round the corner was clearly detestable the very yellow and very blue bodies of these roistering small warriors with their hands on their tin swords and their lips on their tin trumpets started up in every window and on every wall confronting each citizen in turn persuading him that they and they alone were taking him to westminster nor had they apparently for the most part much trouble with electors who finding uncertainty distasteful passionately desired to be assured that the country could at once be saved by little yellow facts or little blue facts as the case might be who had no doubt a dozen other good reasons for being on the one side or the other as for instance that their father had been so before them that their bread was buttered yellow or buttered blue that they had been on the other side last time that they had thought it over and made up their minds that they had innocent blue or naive yellow beer within that his lordship was the man or that the words proper to their mouths were chilcox for bucklandbury and above all the one really creditable reason that so far as they could tell with the best of their intellect and feelings the truth at the moment was either blue or yellow  the narrow high street was thronged with voters tall policemen stationed there had nothing to do the certainty of all that they were going to win seemed to keep everyone in good humour there was as yet no need to break anyones head for though the sharpest lookout was kept for any signs of the philosophic eye it was only to be foundoutside courtierin the perambulators of babies in one old man who rode a bicycle waveringly along the street and stopped to ask a policeman what was the matter in the town and in two rather greenfaced fellows who trundled barrows full of favours both blue and yellow  but though courtier eyed the facts with such suspicion the keenness of everyone about the business struck him as really splendid they went at it with a will having looked forward to it for months they were going to look back on it for months it was evidently a religious ceremony summing up most high feelings and this seemed to one who was himself a man of action natural perhaps pathetic but certainly no matter for scorn  it was already late in the afternoon when there came debouching into the high street a long string of sandwichmen each bearing before and behind him a poster containing these words beautifully situated in large dark blue letters against a pale blue ground                      new complications                       danger not past           vote for miltoun and the government                     and save the empire  courtier stopped to look at them with peculiar indignation not only did this poster tramp in again on his cherished convictions about peace but he saw in it something more than met the unphilosophic eye it symbolized for him all that was catchpenny in the national lifean epitaph on the grave of generosity unutterably sad yet from a party point of view what could be more justifiable was it not desperately important that every blue nerve should be strained that day to turn yellow nerves if not blue at all events green before night fell was it not perfectly true that the empire could only be saved by voting blue could they help a blue paper printing the words new complications which he had read that morning no more than the yellows could help a yellow journal printing the words lord miltouns evening adventure their only business was to win ever fighting fair the yellows had not fought fair they never did and one of their most unfair tactics was the way they had of always accusing the blues of unfair fighting an accusation truly ludicrous as for truth that which helped the world to be blue was obviously true that which didnt as obviously not there was no middle policy the man who saw things neither was a softy and no proper citizen and as for giving the yellows credit for sinceritythe yellows never gave them credit but though courtier knew all that this poster seemed to him particularly damnable and he could not for the life of him resist striking one of the sandwichboards with his cane the resounding thwack startled a butchers pony standing by the pavement it reared and bolted forward with courtier who had naturally seized the rein hanging on a dog dashed past courtier tripped and fell the pony passing over struck him on the head with a hoof for a moment he lost consciousness then coming to himself refused assistance and went to his hotel he felt very giddy and after bandaging a nasty cut lay down on his bed  miltoun returning from that necessary exhibition of himself the crowning fact at every polling centre found time to go and see him  that last poster of yours courtier began at once  im having it withdrawn  its done the trickcongratulationsyoull get in  i knew nothing of it  my dear fellow i didnt suppose you did  when there is a desert courtier between a man and the sacred city he doesnt renounce his journey because he has to wash in dirty water on the way the mobhow i loathe it  there was such pentup fury in those words as to astonish even one whose life had been passed in conflict with majorities  i hate its mean stupidities i hate the sound of its voice and the look on its faceits so ugly its so little courtier i suffer purgatory from the thought that i shall scrape in by the votes of the mob there is sin in using this creature and i am expiating it  to this strange outburst courtier at first made no reply  youve been working too hard he said at last youre off your balance after all the mobs made up of men like you and me  no courtier the mob is not made up of men like you and me if it were it would not be the mob  it looks courtier answered gravely as if you had no business in this galley ive always steered clear of it myself  you follow your feelings i have not that happiness  so saying miltoun turned to the door  courtiers voice pursued him earnestly  drop your politicsif you feel like this about them dont waste your life following whatever it is you follow dont waste hers  but miltoun did not answer  it was a wondrous still night when a few minutes before twelve with his forehead bandaged under his hat the champion of lost causes left the hotel and made his way towards the grammar school for the declaration of the poll a sound as of some monster breathing guided him till from a steep empty street he came in sight of a surging crowd spread over the town square like a dark carpet patterned by splashes of lamplight high up above that crowd on the little peaked tower of the grammar school a brightly lighted clock face presided and over the passionate hopes in those thousands of hearts knit together by suspense the sky had lifted and showed no cloud between them and the purple fields of air to courtier descending towards the square the swaying white faces turned all one way seemed like the heads of giant wild flowers in a dark field shivered by wind the night had charmed away the blue and yellow facts and breathed down into that throng the spirit of emotion and he realized all at once the beauty and meaning of this sceneexpression of the quivering forces whose perpetual flux controlled by the spirit of balance was the soul of the world thousands of hearts with the thought of self lost in one overmastering excitement  an old man with a long grey beard standing close to his elbow murmured  tis anxious worki wouldnt ha missed this for anything in the world  fine eh answered courtier  aye said the old man tis fine ive not seen the like o this since the great yearfortyeight there they arethe aristocrats  following the direction of that skinny hand courtier saw on a balcony lord and lady valleys side by side looking steadily down at the crowd there too leaning against a window and talking to someone behind was barbara the old man went on muttering and courtier could see that his eyes had grown very bright his whole face transfigured by intense hostility he felt drawn to this old creature thus moved to the very soul then he saw barbara looking down at him with her hand raised to her temple to show that she saw his bandaged head he had the presence of mind not to lift his hat  the old man spoke again  you wouldnt remember fortyeight i suppose there was a feeling in the people thenwe would ha died for things in those days im eightyfour and he held his shaking hand up to his breast but the spirits alive here yet god send the radical gets in there was wafted from him a scent as of potatoes  far behind at the very edge of the vast dark throng some voices began singing way down upon the swanee ribber the tune floated forth ceased spurted up once more and died  then in the very centre of the square a stentorian baritone roared forth should auld acquaintance be forgot  the song swelled till every kind of voice from treble to the old chartists quavering bass was chanting it here and there the crowd heaved with the movement of linked arms courtier found the soft fingers of a young woman in his right hand the old chartists dry trembling paw in his left he himself sang loudly the grave and fearful music sprang straight up into they air rolled out right and left and was lost among the hills but it had no sooner died away than the same huge baritone yelled god save our gracious king the stature of the crowd seemed at once to leap up two feet and from under that platform of raised hats rose a stupendous shouting  this thought courtier is religion  they were singing even on the balconies by the lamplight he could see lord valleys mouth not opened quite enough as though his voice were just a little ashamed of coming out and barbara with her head flung back against the pillar pouring out her heart no mouth in all the crowd was silent it was as though the soul of the english people were escaping from its dungeon of reserve on the pinions of that chant  but suddenly like a shot bird closing wings the song fell silent and dived headlong back to earth out from under the clockface had moved a thin dark figure more figures came behind courtier could see miltoun a voice far away cried up chilcox a huge husill followed then such a silence that the sound of an engine shunting a mile away could be heard plainly  the dark figure moved forward and a tiny square of paper gleamed out white against the black of his frockcoat  ladies and gentlemen result of the poll  miltoun four thousand eight hundred and ninetyeight chilcox four thousand eight hundred and two  the silence seemed to fall to earth and break into a thousand pieces through the pandemonium of cheers and groaning courtier with all his strength forced himself towards the balcony he could see lord valleys leaning forward with a broad smile lady valleys passing her hand across her eyes barbara with her hand in harbingers looking straight into his face he stopped the old chartist was still beside him tears rolling down his cheeks into his beard  courtier saw miltoun come forward and stand unsmiling deathly pale     part ii     chapter i  at three oclock in the afternoon of the nineteenth of july little ann shropton commenced the ascent of the main staircase of valleys house london she climbed slowly in the very middle an extremely small white figure on those wide and shining stairs counting them aloud their number was never alike two days running which made them attractive to one for whom novelty was the salt of life  coming to that spot where they branched she paused to consider which of the two flights she had used last and unable to remember sat down she was the bearer of a message it had been new when she started but was already comparatively old and likely to become older in view of a design now conceived by her of travelling the whole length of the picture gallery and while she sat maturing this plan sunlight flooding through a large window drove a white refulgence down into the heart of the wide polished space of wood and marble whence she had come the nature of little ann habitually rejected fairies and all fantastic things finding them quite too much in the air and devoid of sufficient reality and go and this refulgence almost unearthly in its travelling glory passed over her small head and played strangely with the pillars in the hall without exciting in her any fancies or any sentiment the intention of discovering what was at the end of the picture gallery absorbed the whole of her essentially practical and active mind deciding on the lefthand flight of stairs she entered that immensely long narrow andwith blinds drawnrather dark saloon she walked carefully because the floor was very slippery here and with a kind of seriousness due partly to the darkness and partly to the pictures they were indeed in this light rather formidable those old caradocs black armoured creatures some of them who seemed to eye with a sort of burning grim defensive greed the small white figure of their descendant passing along between them but little ann who knew they were only pictures maintained her course steadily and every now and then as she passed one who seemed to her rather uglier than the others wrinkled her sudden little nose at the end as she had thought appeared a door she opened it and passed on to a landing there was a stone staircase in the corner and there were two doors it would be nice to go up the staircase but it would also be nice to open the doors going towards the first door with a little thrill she turned the handle it was one of those rooms necessary in houses for which she had no great liking and closing this door rather loudly she opened the other one finding herself in a chamber not resembling the rooms downstairs which were all high and nicely gilded but more like where she had lessons low and filled with books and leather chairs from the end of the room which she could not see she heard a sound as of someone kissing something and instinct had almost made her turn to go away when the word hallo suddenly opened her lips and almost directly she saw that granny and grandpapa were standing by the fireplace not knowing quite whether they were glad to see her she went forward and began at once  is this where you sit grandpapa  it is  its nice isnt it granny where does the stone staircase go to  to the roof of the tower ann  oh i have to give a message so i must go now  sorry to lose you  yes goodbye  hearing the door shut behind her lord and lady valleys looked at each other with a dubious smile  the little interview which she had interrupted had arisen in this way  accustomed to retire to this quiet and homely room which was not his official study where he was always liable to the attacks of secretaries lord valleys had come up here after lunch to smoke and chew the cud of a worry  the matter was one in connection with his pendridny estate in cornwall it had long agitated both his agent and himself and had now come to him for final decision the question affected two villages to the north of the property whose inhabitants were solely dependent on the working of a large quarry which had for some time been losing money  a kindly man he was extremely averse to any measure which would plunge his tenants into distress and especially in cases where there had been no question of opposition between himself and them but reduced to its essentials the matter stood thus apart from that particular quarry the pendridny estate was not only a going but even a profitable concern supporting itself and supplying some of the sinews of war towards valleys house and the racing establishment at newmarket and other general expenses with this quarry still running allowing for the upkeep of pendridny and the provision of pensions to superannuated servants it was rather the other way  sitting there that afternoon smoking his favourite pipe he had at last come to the conclusion that there was nothing for it but to close down he had not made this resolution lightly though to do him justice the knowledge that the decision would be bound to cause an outcry in the local and perhaps the national press had secretly rather spurred him on to the resolve than deterred him from it he felt as if he were being dictated to in advance and he did not like dictation to have to deprive these poor people of their immediate living was he knew a good deal more irksome to him than to those who would certainly make a fuss about it his conscience was clear and he could discount that future outcry as mere party spite he had very honestly tried to examine the thing all round and had reasoned thus if i keep this quarry open i am really admitting the principle of pauperization since i naturally look to each of my estates to support its own house grounds shooting and to contribute towards the support of this house and my family and racing stable and all the people employed about them both  to allow any business to be run on my estates which does not contribute to the general upkeep is to protect and really pauperize a portion of my tenants at the expense of the rest it must therefore be false economics and a secret sort of socialism further if logically followed out it might end in my ruin and to allow that though i might not personally object would be to imply that i do not believe that i am by virtue of my traditions and training the best machinery through which the state can work to secure the welfare of the people  when he had reached that point in his consideration of the question his mind or rather perhaps his essential self had not unnaturally risen up and said which is absurd  impersonality was in fashion and as a rule he believed in thinking impersonally there was a point however where the possibility of doing so ceased without treachery to oneself ones order and the country and to the argument which he was quite shrewd enough to put to himself sooner than have it put by anyone else that it was disproportionate for a single man by a stroke of the pen to be able to dispose of the livelihood of hundreds whose senses and feelings were similar to his ownhe had answered if i didnt some plutocrat or company wouldor worse still the state cooperative enterprise being in his opinion foreign to the spirit of the country there was so far as he could see no other alternative facts were facts and not to be got over  notwithstanding all this the necessity for the decision made him sorry for if he had no great sense of proportion he was at least humane  he was still smoking his pipe and staring at a sheet of paper covered with small figures when his wife entered though she had come to ask his advice on a very different subject she saw at once that he was vexed and said  whats the matter geoff  lord valleys rose went to the hearth deliberately tapped out his pipe then held out to her the sheet of paper  that quarry nothing for itmust go  lady valleys face changed  oh no it will mean such dreadful distress  lord valleys stared at his nails its putting a drag on the whole estate he said  i know but how could we face the peoplei should never be able to go down there and most of them have such enormous families  since lord valleys continued to bend on his nails that slow thoughtforming stare she went on earnestly  rather than that id make sacrifices id sooner pendridny were let than throw all those people out of work i suppose it would let  let best woodcock shooting in the world  lady valleys pursuing her thoughts went on  in time we might get the people drafted into other things have you consulted miltoun  no said lord valleys shortly and dont mean tohes too unpractical  he always seems to know what he wants very well  i tell you repeated lord valleys miltouns no good in a matter of this sorthe and his ideas throw back to the middle ages  lady valleys went closer and took him by the lapels of his collar  geoffreally to please me some other way  lord valleys frowned staring at her for some time and at last answered  to please youill leave it over another year  you think thats better than letting  i dont like the thought of some outsider there time enough to come to that if we must take it as my christmas present  lady valleys rather flushed bent forward and kissed his ear  it was at this moment that little ann had entered  when she was gone and they had exchanged that dubious look lady valleys said  i came about babs i dont know what to make of her since we came up shes not putting her heart into things  lord valleys answered almost sulkily  its the heat probablyor claud harbinger in spite of his easygoing parentalism he disliked the thought of losing the child whom he so affectionately admired  ah said lady valleys slowly im not so sure  how do you mean  theres something queer about her im by no means certain she hasnt got some sort of feeling for that mr courtier  what said lord valleys growing most unphilosophically red  exactly  confound it gertrude miltouns business was quite enough for one year  for twenty murmured lady valleys im watching her hes going to persia they say  and leaving his bones there i hope muttered lord valleys really its too much i should think youre all wrong though  lady valleys raised her eyebrows men were very queer about such things very queer and worse than helpless  well she said i must go to my meeting ill take her and see if i can get at something and she went away  it was the inaugural meeting of the society for the promotion of the birth rate over which she had promised to preside the scheme was one in which she had been prominent from the start appealing as it did to her large and fullblooded nature many movements to which she found it impossible to refuse her name had in themselves but small attraction and it was a real comfort to feel something approaching enthusiasm for one branch of her public work not that there was any academic consistency about her in the matter for in private life amongst her friends she was not narrowly dogmatic on the duty of wives to multiply exceedingly she thought imperially on the subject without bigotry large healthy families in all cases save individual ones the prime idea at the back of her mind wasnational expansion her motto and she intended if possible to make it the motto of the league was de laudace et encore de laudace it was a question of the full realization of the nation she had a true and in a sense touching belief in the flag apart from what it might cover it was her idealism you may talk she would say as much as you like about directing national life in accordance with social justice what does the nation care about social justice the thing is much bigger than that its a matter of sentiment we must expand  on the way to the meeting occupied with her speech she made no attempt to draw barbara into conversation that must wait the child though languid and pale was looking so beautiful that it was a pleasure to have her support in such a movement  in a little dark room behind the hall the committee were already assembled and they went at once on to the platform     chapter ii  unmoved by the stares of the audience barbara sat absorbed in moody thoughts  into the three weeks since miltouns election there had been crowded such a multitude of functions that she had found as it were no time no energy to know where she stood with herself since that morning in the stable when he had watched her with the horse hal harbinger had seemed to live only to be close to her and the consciousness of his passion gave her a tingling sense of pleasure she had been riding and dancing with him and sometimes this had been almost blissful but there were times too when she feltthough always with a certain contempt of herself as when she sat on that sunwarmed stone below the tora queer dissatisfaction a longing for something outside a world where she had to invent her own starvations and simplicities to makebelieve in earnestness  she had seen courtier three times once he had come to dine in response to an invitation from lady valleys worded in that charming almost wistful style which she had taught herself to use to those below her in social rank especially if they were intelligent once to the valleys house garden party and next day having told him what time she would be riding she had found him in the row not mounted but standing by the rail just where she must pass with that look on his face of mingled deference and ironic selfcontainment of which he was a master it appeared that he was leaving england and to her questions why and where he had only shrugged his shoulders up on this dusty platform in the hot bare hall facing all those people listening to speeches whose sense she was too languid and preoccupied to take in the whole medley of thoughts and faces round her and the sound of the speakers voices formed a kind of nightmare out of which she noted with extreme exactitude the colour of her mothers neck beneath a large black hat and the expression on the face of a committee man to the right who was biting his fingers under cover of a blue paper she realized that someone was speaking amongst the audience casting forth as it were small bunches of words she could see hima little man in a black coat with a white face which kept jerking up and down  i feel that this is terrible she heard him say i feel that this is blasphemy that we should try to tamper with the greatest force the greatest and the most sacred and secretforce thatthat moves in the world is to me horrible i cannot bear to listen it seems to make everything so small she saw him sit down and her mother rising to answer  we must all sympathize with the sincerity and to a certain extent with the intention of our friend in the body of the hall but we must ask ourselves  have we the right to allow ourselves the luxury of private feelings in a matter which concerns the national expansion we must not give way to sentiment our friend in the body of the hall spokehe will forgive me for saying solike a poet rather than a serious reformer i am afraid that if we let ourselves drop into poetry the birth rate of this country will very soon drop into poetry too and that i think it is impossible for us to contemplate with folded hands the resolution i was about to propose when our friend in the body of the hall  but barbaras attention had wandered off again into that queer medley of thoughts and feelings out of which the little man had so abruptly roused her then she realized that the meeting was breaking up and her mother saying  now my dear its hospital day weve just time  when they were once more in the car she leaned back very silent watching the traffic  lady valleys eyed her sidelong  what a little bombshell she said from that small person he must have got in by mistake i hear mr courtier has a card for helen gloucesters ball tonight babs  poor man  you will be there said lady valleys dryly  barbara drew back into her corner  dont tease me mother  an expression of compunction crossed lady valleys face she tried to possess herself of barbaras hand but that languid hand did not return her squeeze  i know the mood youre in dear it wants all ones pluck to shake it off dont let it grow on you youd better go down to uncle dennis tomorrow youve been overdoing it  barbara sighed  i wish it were tomorrow  the car had stopped and lady valleys said  will you come in or are you too tired it always does them good to see you  youre twice as tired as me barbara answered of course ill come  at the entrance of the two ladies there rose at once a faint buzz and murmur lady valleys whose ample presence radiated suddenly a businesslike and cheery confidence went to a bedside and sat down but barbara stood in a thin streak of the july sunlight uncertain where to begin amongst the faces turned towards her the poor dears looked so humble and so wistful and so tired there was one lying quite flat who had not even raised her head to see who had come in that slumbering pale high cheekboned face had a frailty as if a touch a breath would shatter it a wisp of the blackest hair finer than silk lay across the forehead the closed eyes were deep sunk one hand scarred almost to the bone with work rested above her breast she breathed between lips which had no colour about her sleeping was a kind of beauty and there came over the girl a queer rush of emotion the sleeper seemed so apart from everything there from all the formality and stiffness of the ward to look at her swept away the languid hollow feeling with which she had come in it made her think of the tors at home when the wind was blowing and all was bare and grand and sometimes terrible there was something elemental in that still sleep and the old lady in the next led with a brown wrinkled face and bright black eyes brimful of life seemed almost vulgar beside such remote tranquillity while she was telling barbara that a little bunch of heather in the better half of a soapdish on the windowsill had come from wales because as she explained my mother was born in stirling dearie so i likes a bit of heather though i never been out o bethnal green meself  but when barbara again passed the sleeping woman was sitting up and looked but a poor ordinary thingher strange fragile beauty all withdrawn  it was a relief when lady valleys said  my dear my naval bazaar at fivethirty and while im there you must go home and have a rest and freshen yourself up for the evening we dine at plassey house  the duchess of gloucesters ball a function which no one could very well miss had been fixed for this late date owing to the duchesss announced desire to prolong the season and so help the hackney cabmen and though everybody sympathized it had been felt by most that it would be simpler to go away motor up on the day of the ball and motor down again on the following morning and throughout the week by which the season was thus prolonged in long rows at the railway stations and on their stands the hackney cabmen unconscious of what was being done for them waited patient as their horses but since everybody was making this special effort an exceptionally large exclusive and brilliant company reassembled at gloucester house  in the vast ballroom over the medley of entwined revolving couples punkahs had been fixed to clear and freshen the languid air and these huge fans moving with incredible slowness drove a faint refreshing draught down over the sea of white shirtfronts and bare necks and freed the scent from innumerable flowers  late in the evening close by one of the great clumps of bloom a very pretty woman stood talking to bertie caradoc she was his cousin lily malvezin sister of geoffrey winlow and wife of a liberal peer a charming creature whose pink cheeks bright eyes quick lips and rounded figure endowed her with the prettiest air of animation and while she spoke she kept stealing sly glances at her partner trying as it were to pierce the armour of that selfcontained young man  no my dear she said in her mocking voice youll never persuade me that miltoun is going to catch on il est trop intransigeant ah theres babs  for the girl had come gliding by her eyes wandering lazily her lips just parted her neck hardly less pale than her white frock her face pale and marked with languor under the heavy coil of her tawny hair and her swaying body seeming with each turn of the waltz to be caught by the arms of her partner from out of a swoon  with that immobility of lips learned by all imprisoned in society lily malvezin murmured  whos that shes dancing with is it the dark horse bertie  through lips no less immobile bertie answered  forty to one no takers  but those inquisitive bright eyes still followed barbara drifting in the dance like a great waterlily caught in the swirl of a mill pool and the thought passed through that pretty head  shes hooked him its naughty of babs really and then she saw leaning against a pillar another whose eyes also were following those two and she thought hm poor claudno wonder hes looking like that oh babs  by one of the statues on the terrace barbara and her partner stood where trees disfigured by no gaudy lanterns offered the refreshment of their darkness and serenity  wrapped in her new pale languor still breathing deeply from the waltz she seemed to courtier too utterly moulded out of loveliness to what end should a man frame speeches to a vision she was but an incarnation of beauty imprinted on the air and would fade out at a touchlike the sudden ghosts of enchantment that came to one under the blue and the starlit snow of a mountain night or in a birch wood all wistful golden speech seemed but desecration besides what of interest was there for him to say in this world of hers so bewildering and of such glib assurancethis world that was like a building whose every window was shut and had a blind drawn down a building that admitted none who had not sworn as it were to believe it the world the whole world and nothing but the world outside which were only the nibbled remains of what had built it this world of society in which he felt like one travelling through a desert longing to meet a fellowcreature  the voice of harbinger behind them said  ladybabs  long did the punkahs waft their breeze over that bravehued wheel of pleasure and the sound of the violins quaver and wail out into the morning then quickly as the spangles of dew vanish off grass when the sun rises all melted away and in the great rooms were none but flunkeys presiding over the polished surfaces like flamingoes by some lakeside at dawn     chapter iii  a brick dowerhouse of the fitzharolds just outside the little seaside town of nettlefold sheltered the tranquil days of lord dennis in that southcoast air sanest and most healing in all england he raged very slowly taking little thought of death and much quiet pleasure in his life like the tall old house with its high windows and squat chimneys he was marvellously selfcontained his books for he somewhat passionately examined old civilizations and described their habits from time to time with a dry and not too poignant pen in a certain oldfashioned magazine his microscope for he studied infusoria and the fishing boat of his friend john bogle who had long perceived that lord dennis was the biggest fish he ever caught all these with occasional visitors and little runs to london to monkland and other country houses made up the sum of a life which if not desperately beneficial was uniformly kind and harmless and by its notorious simplicity had a certain negative influence not only on his own class but on the relations of that class with the country at large it was commonly said in nettlefold that he was a gentleman if they were all like him there wasnt much in all this talk against the lords the shop people and lodginghouse keepers felt that the interests of the country were safer in his hands than in the hands of people who wanted to meddle with everything for the good of those who were only anxious to be let alone a man too who could so completely forget he was the son of a duke that other people never forgot it was the man for their money it was true that he had never had a say in public affairs but this was overlooked because he could have had it if he liked and the fact that he did not like only showed once more that he was a gentleman  just as he was the one personality of the little town against whom practically nothing was ever said so was his house the one house which defied criticism time had made it utterly suitable the ivied walls and purplish roof lichened yellow in places the quiet meadows harbouring ponies and kine reaching from it to the seaall was mellow in truth it made all the other houses of the town seem shoddystanding alone beyond them like its master if anything a little too esthetically remote from common wants  he had practically no near neighbours of whom he saw anything except once in a way young harbinger three miles distant at whitewater but since he had the faculty of not being bored with his own society this did not worry him of local charity especially to the fishers of the town whose winter months were nowadays very bare of profit he was prodigal to the verge of extravagance for his income was not great but in politics beyond acting as the figurehead of certain municipal efforts he took little or no part his toryism indeed was of the mild order that had little belief in the regeneration of the country by any means but those of kindly feeling between the classes when asked how that was to be brought about he would answer with his dry slightly malicious suavity that if you stirred hornets nests with sticks the hornets would come forth having no land he was shy of expressing himself on that vexed question but if resolutely attacked would give utterance to some such sentiment as this the lands best in our hands on the whole but we want fewer dogsinthemanger among us  he had as became one of his race a feeling for land tender and protective and could not bear to think of its being put out to farm with that cold mother the state he was ironical over the views of radicals or socialists but disliked to hear such people personally abused behind their backs it must be confessed however that if contradicted he increased considerably the ironical decision of his sentiments withdrawn from all chance in public life of enforcing his views on others the natural aristocrat within him was forced to find some expression  each year towards the end of july he placed his house at the service of lord valleys who found it a convenient centre for attending goodwood  it was on the morning after the duchess of gloucesters ball that he received this note   valleys house  dearest uncle dennis  may i come down to you a little before time and rest london is so terribly hot mother has three functions still to stay for and i shall have to come back again for our last evening the political oneso i dont want to go all the way to monkland and anywhere else except with you would be rackety eustace looks so seedy ill try and bring him if i may granny is terribly well  best love dear from your  babs   the same afternoon she came but without miltoun driving up from the station in a fly lord dennis met her at the gate and having kissed her looked at her somewhat anxiously caressing his white peaked beard he had never yet known babs sick of anything except when he took her out in john bogles boat she was certainly looking pale and her hair was done differentlya fact disturbing to one who did not discover it slipping his arm through hers he led her out into a meadow still full of buttercups where an old white pony who had carried her in the row twelve years ago came up to them and rubbed his muzzle against her waist and suddenly there rose in lord dennis the thoroughly discomforting and strange suspicion that though the child was not going to cry she wanted time to get over the feeling that she was without appearing to separate himself from her he walked to the wall at the end of the field and stood looking at the sea  the tide was nearly up the south wind driving over it brought him the scent of the seaflowers and the crisp rustle of little waves swimming almost to his feet far out where the sunlight fell the smiling waters lay white and mysterious in july haze giving him a queer feeling but lord dennis though he had his moments of poetic sentiment was on the whole quite able to keep the sea in its proper placefor after all it was the english channel and like a good englishman he recognized that if you once let things get away from their names they ceased to be facts and if they ceased to be facts they becamethe devil in truth he was not thinking much of the sea but of barbara it was plain that she was in trouble of some kind and the notion that babs could find trouble in life was extraordinarily queer for he felt subconsciously what a great driving force of disturbance was necessary to penetrate the hundred folds of the luxurious cloak enwrapping one so young and fortunate it was not death therefore it must be love and he thought at once of that fellow with the red moustaches ideas were all very wellno one would object to as many as you liked in their proper placethe dinnertable for example but to fall in love if indeed it were so with a man who not only had ideas but an inclination to live up to them and on them and on nothing else seemed to lord dennis outre  she had followed him to the wall and he lookedat her dubiously  to rest in the waters of lethe babs by the way seen anything of our friend mr courtier very picturesquethat quixotic theory of life  and in saying that his voice like so many refined voices which have turned their backs on speculation was tripletonedmocking at ideas mocking at itself for mocking at ideas yet showing plainly that at bottom it only mocked at itself for mocking at ideas because it would be as it were crude not to do so  but barbara did not answer his question and began to speak of other things and all that afternoon and evening she talked away so lightly that lord dennis but for his instinct would have been deceived  that wonderful smiling maskthe inscrutability of youthwas laid aside by her at night sitting at her window under the moon a goldbright moth slowspinning up the sky she watched the darkness hungrily as though it were a great thought into whose heart she was trying to see now and then she stroked herself getting strange comfort out of the presence of her body she had that old unhappy feeling of having two selves within her and this soft night full of the quiet stir of the sea and of dark immensity woke in her a terrible longing to be at one with something somebody outside herself at the ball last night the flying feeling had seized on her again and was still therea queer manifestation of her streak of recklessness and this result of her contacts with courtier this cacoethes volandi and feeling of clipped wings hurt heras being forbidden hurts a child  she remembered how in the housekeepers room at monkland there lived a magpie who had once sought shelter in an orchidhouse from some pursuer as soon as they thought him wedded to civilization they had let him go to see whether he would come back for hours he had sat up in a high tree and at last come down again to his cage whereupon fearing lest the rooks should attack him when he next took this voyage of discovery they clipped one of his wings after that the twilight bird though he lived happily enough hopping about his cage and the terrace which served him for exercise yard would seem at times restive and frightened moving his wings as if flying in spirit and sad that he must stay on earth  so too at her window barbara fluttered her wings then getting into bed lay sighing and tossing a clock struck three and seized by an intolerable impatience at her own discomfort she slipped a motor coat over her nightgown put on slippers and stole out into the passage the house was very still she crept downstairs smothering her footsteps groping her way through the hall inhabited by the thin ghosts of wouldbe light she slid back the chain of the door and fled towards the sea she made no more noise running in the dew than a bird following the paths of air and the two ponies who felt her figure pass in the darkness snuffled sending out soft sighs of alarm amongst the closed buttercups she climbed the wall over to the beach while she was running she had fully meant to dash into the sea and cool herself but it was so black with just a thin edging scarf of white and the sky was black bereft of lights waiting for the day  she stood and looked and all the leapings and pulsings of flesh and spirit slowly died in that wide dark loneliness where the only sound was the wistful breaking of small waves she was well used to these dead hoursonly last night at this very time harbingers arm had been round her in a last waltz but here the dead hours had such different faces wideeyed solemn and there came to barbara staring out at them a sense that the darkness saw her very soul so that it felt little and timid within her she shivered in her furlined coat as if almost frightened at finding herself so marvellously nothing before that black sky and dark sea which seemed all one relentlessly great and crouching down she waited for the dawn to break  it came from over the downs sweeping a rush of cold air on its wings flighting towards the sea with it the daring soon crept back into her blood she stripped and ran down into the dark water fast growing pale it covered her jealously and she set to work to swim the water was warmer than the air she lay on her back and splashed watching the sky flush to bathe like this in the halfdark with her hair floating out and no wet clothes clinging to her limbs gave her the joy of a child doing a naughty thing she swam out of her depth then scared at her own adventure swam in again as the sun rose  she dashed into her two garments climbed the wall and scurried back to the house all her dejection and feverish uncertainty were gone she felt keen fresh terribly hungry and stealing into the dark diningroom began rummaging for food she found biscuits and was still munching when in the open doorway she saw lord dennis a pistol in one hand and a lighted candle in the other with his carved features and white beard above an old blue dressinggown he looked impressive having at the moment a distinct resemblance to lady casterley as though danger had armoured him in steel  you call this resting he said dryly then looking at her drowned hair added i see you have already entrusted your trouble to the waters of lethe  but without answer barbara vanished into the dim hall and up the stairs     chapter iv  while barbara was swimming to meet the dawn miltoun was bathing in those waters of mansuetude and truth which roll from wall to wall in the british house of commons  in that long debate on the land question for which he had waited to make his first speech he had already risen nine times without catching the speakers eye and slowly a sense of unreality was creeping over him surely this great chamber where without end rose the small sound of a single human voice and queer mechanical bursts of approbation and resentment did not exist at all but as a gigantic fancy of his own and all these figures were figments of his brain and when he at last spoke it would be himself alone that he addressed the torpid air tainted with human breath the unwinking stare of the countless lights the long rows of seats the queer distant rounds of pale listening flesh perched up so high they were all emanations of himself even the coming and going in the gangway was but the coming and going of little wilful parts of him and rustling deep down in this titanic creature of his fancy was the murmuration of his own unspoken speech sweeping away the puff balls of words flung up by that faraway small varying voice  then suddenly all that dream creature had vanished he was on his feet with a thumping heart speaking  soon he had no tremors only a dim consciousness that his words sounded strange and a queer icy pleasure in flinging them out into the silence round him there seemed no longer men only mouths and eyes and he had enjoyment in the feeling that with these words of his he was holding those hungry mouths and eyes dumb and unmoving then he knew that he had reached the end of what he had to say and sat down remaining motionless in the centre of a various sound staring at the back of the head in front of him with his hands clasped round his knee and soon when that little faraway voice was once more speaking he took his hat and glancing neither to right nor left went out  instead of the sensation of relief and wild elation which fills the heart of those who have taken the first plunge miltoun had nothing in his deep dark well but the waters of bitterness in truth with the delivery of that speech he had but parted with what had been a sort of anodyne to suffering he had only put the fine point on his conviction of how vain was his career now that he could not share it with audrey noel he walked slowly towards the temple along the riverside where the lamps were paling into nothingness before that daily celebration of divinity the meeting of dark and light  for miltoun was not one of those who take things lying down he took things desperately deeply and with revolt he took them like a rider riding himself plunging at the dig of his own spurs chafing and wincing at the cruel tugs of his own bitt bearing in his friendless proud heart all the burden of struggles which shallower or more genial natures shared with others  he looked hardly less haggard walking home than some of those homeless ones who slept nightly by the river as though they knew that to lie near one who could so readily grant oblivion alone could save them from seeking that consolation he was perhaps unhappier than they whose spirits at all events had long ceased to worry them having oozed out from their bodies under the foot of life  now that audrey noel was lost to him her loveliness and that indescribable quality which made her lovable floated before him the very tortureflowers of a beauty never to be graspedyet that he could grasp if he only would that was the heart and fervour of his suffering to be grasped if he only would he was suffering too physically from a kind of slow fever the result of his wetting on the day when he last saw her and through that latent fever things and feelings like his sensations in the house before his speech were all as it were muffled in a horrible way as if they all came to him wrapped in a sort of flannel coating through which he could not cut and all the time there seemed to be within him two men at mortal grips with one another the man of faith in divine sanction and authority on which all his beliefs had hitherto hinged and a desperate warmblooded hungry creature he was very miserable craving strangely for the society of someone who could understand what he was feeling and from long habit of making no confidants not knowing how to satisfy that craving  it was dawn when he reached his rooms and sure that he would not sleep he did not even go to bed but changed his clothes made himself some coffee and sat down at the window which overlooked the flowered courtyard  in middle temple hall a ball was still in progress though the glamour from its chinese lanterns was already darkened and gone miltoun saw a man and a girl sheltered by an old fountain sitting out their last dance her head had sunk on her partners shoulder their lips were joined and there floated up to the window the scent of heliotrope with the tune of the waltz that those two should have been dancing this couple so stealthily enlaced the gleam of their furtively turned eyes the whispering of their lips that stony niche below the twittering sparrows so cunningly sought outit was the world he had abjured when he looked again theylike a vision seenhad stolen away and gone the music too had ceased there was no scent of heliotrope in the stony niche crouched a stray cat watching the twittering sparrows  miltoun went out and turning into the empty strand walked onwithout heeding where till towards five oclock he found himself on putney bridge  he rested there leaning over the parapet looking down at the grey water the sun was just breaking through the heat haze early waggons were passing and already men were coming in to work to what end did the river wander up and down and a human river flow across it twice every day to what end were men and women suffering of the full current of this life miltoun could no more see the aim than that of the wheeling gulls in the early sunlight  leaving the bridge he made towards barnes common the night was still ensnared there on the gorse bushes grey with cobwebs and starry dewdrops he passed a tramp family still sleeping huddled all together even the homeless lay in each others arms  from the common he emerged on the road near the gates of ravensham turning in there he found his way to the kitchen garden and sat down on a bench close to the raspberry bushes they were protected from thieves but at miltouns approach two blackbirds flustered out through the netting and flew away  his long figure resting so motionless impressed itself on the eyes of a gardener who caused a report to be circulated that his young lordship was in the fruit garden it reached the ears of clifton who himself came out to see what this might mean the old man took his stand in front of miltoun very quietly  you have come to breakfast my lord  if my grandmother will have me clifton  i understood your lordship was speaking last night  i was  you find the house of commons satisfactory i hope  fairly thank you clifton  they are not what they were in the great days of your grandfather i believe he had a very good opinion of them they vary no doubt  tempora mutantur  that is so i find quite anew spirit towards public affairs the hapenny press one takes it in but one hardly approves i shall be anxious to read your speech they say a first speech is a great strain  it is rather  but you had no reason to be anxious im sure it was beautiful  miltoun saw that the old mans thin sallow cheeks had flushed to a deep orange between his snowwhite whiskers  i have looked forward to this day he stammered ever since i knew your lordshiptwentyeight years it is the beginning  or the end clifton  the old mans face fell in a look of deep and concerned astonishment  no no he said with your antecedents never  miltoun took his hand  sorry cliftondidnt mean to shock you  and for a minute neither spoke looking at their clasped hands as if surprised  would your lordship like a bathbreakfast is still at eight i can procure you a razor  when miltoun entered the breakfast room his grandmother with a copy of the times in her hands was seated before a grape fruit which with a shredded wheat biscuit constituted her first meal her appearance hardly warranted barbaras description of terribly well in truth she looked a little white as if she had been feeling the heat but there was no lack of animation in her little steelgrey eyes nor of decision in her manner  i see she said that youve taken a line of your own eustace ive nothing to say against that in fact quite the contrary but remember this my dear however you may change you mustnt wobble only one thing counts in that place hitting the same nail on the head with the same hammer all the time you arent looking at all well  miltoun bending to kiss her murmured  thanks im all right  nonsense replied lady casterley they dont look after you was your mother in the house  i dont think so  exactly and what is barbara about she ought to be seeing to you  barbara is down with uncle dennis  lady casterley set her jaw then looking her grandson through and through said  i shall take you down there this very day i shall have the sea to you what do you say clifton  his lordship does look pale  have the carriage and well go from clapham junction thomas can go in and fetch you some clothes or better though i dislike them we can telephone to your mother for a car its very hot for trains arrange that please clifton  to this project miltoun raised no objection and all through the drive he remained sunk in an indifference and lassitude which to lady casterley seemed in the highest degree ominous for lassitude to her was the strange the unpardonable state the little great ladycasket of the aristocratic principlewas permeated to the very backbone with the instinct of artificial energy of that alert vigour which those who have nothing socially to hope for are forced to develop lest they should decay and be again obliged to hope to speak honest truth she could not forbear an itch to run some sharp and foreign substance into her grandson to rouse him somehow for she knew the reason of his state and was temperamentally out of patience with such a cause for backsliding had it been any other of her grandchildren she would not have hesitated but there was that in miltoun which held even lady casterley in check and only once during the four hours of travel did she attempt to break down his reserve she did it in a manner very soft for herwas he not of all living things the hope and pride of her heart tucking her little thin sharp hand under his arm she said quietly  my dear dont brood over it that will never do  but miltoun removed her hand gently and laid it back on the dust rug nor did he answer or show other sign of having heard  and lady casterley deeply wounded pressed her faded lips together and said sharply  slower please frith     chapter v  it was to barbara that miltoun unfolded if but little the trouble of his spirit lying that same afternoon under a ragged tamarisk hedge with the tide far out he could never have done this if there had not been between them the accidental revelation of that night at monkland nor even then perhaps had he not felt in this young sister of his the warmth of life for which he was yearning in such a matter as love barbara was the elder of these two for besides the motherly knowledge of the heart peculiar to most women she had the inherent womanoftheworldliness to be expected of a daughter of lord and lady valleys if she herself were in doubt as to the state of her affections it was not as with miltoun on the score of the senses and the heart but on the score of her spirit and curiosity which courtier had awakened and caused to flap their wings a little she worried over miltouns forlorn case it hurt her too to think of mrs noel eating her heart out in that lonely cottage a sister sogood and earnest as agatha had ever inclined barbara to a rebellious view of morals and disinclined her altogether to religion and so she felt that if those two could not be happy apart they should be happy together in the name of all the joy there was in life  and while her brother lay face to the sky under the tamarisks she kept trying to think of how to console him conscious that she did not in the least understand the way he thought about things over the fields behind the larks were hymning the promise of the unripe corn the foreshore was painted all colours from vivid green to mushroom pink by the edge of the blue sea little black figures stooped gathering sapphire the air smelled sweet in the shade of the tamarisk there was ineffable peace and barbara covered by the network of sunlight could not help impatience with a suffering which seemed to her so corrigible by action at last she ventured  life is short eusty  miltouns answer given without movement startled her  persuade me that it is babs and ill bless you if the singing of these larks means nothing if that blue up there is a morass of our invention if we are pettily creeping on furthering nothing if theres no purpose in our lives persuade me of it for gods sake  carried suddenly beyond her depth barbara could only put out her hand and say oh dont take things so hard  since you say that life is short miltoun muttered with his smile you shouldnt spoil it by feeling pity in old days we went to the tower for our convictions we can stand a little private roasting i hope or has the sand run out of us altogether  stung by his tone barbara answered in rather a hard voice  what we must bear we must i suppose but why should we make trouble thats what i cant stand  o profound wisdom  barbara flushed  i love life she said  the galleons of the westering sun were already sailing in a broad gold fleet straight for that foreshore where the little black stooping figures had not yet finished their toil the larks still sang over the unripe cornwhen harbinger galloping along the sands from whitewater to sea house came on that silent couple walking home to dinner  it would not be safe to say of this young man that he readily diagnosed a spiritual atmosphere but this was the less his demerit since everything from his cradle up had conspired to keep the spiritual thermometer of his surroundings at 60 in the shade and the fact that his own spiritual thermometer had now run up so that it threatened to burst the bulb rendered him less likely than ever to see what was happening with other peoples yet he did notice that barbara was looking pale andit seemedsweeter than ever with her eldest brother he always somehow felt ill at ease he could not exactly afford to despise an uncompromising spirit in one of his own order but he was no more impervious than others to miltouns caustic thinlyveiled contempt for the commonplace and having a fullblooded belief in himselfusual with men of fine physique whose lots are so cast that this belief can never or almost never be really shakenhe greatly disliked the feeling of being a little looked down on it was an intense relief when saying that he wanted a certain magazine miltoun strode off into the town  to harbinger no less than to miltoun and barbara last night had been bitter and restless the sight of that pale swaying figure with the parted lips whirling round in courtiers arms had clung to his vision ever since the ball during his own last dance with her he had been almost savagely silent only by a great effort restraining his tongue from mordant allusions to that prancing redhaired fellow as he secretly called the champion of lost causes in fact his sensations there and since had been a revelation or would have teen if he could have stood apart to see them true he had gone about next day with his usual cool offhand manner because one naturally did not let people see but it was with such an inner aching and rage of want and jealousy as to really merit pity men of his physically big rather rushing type are the last to possess their souls in patience walking home after the ball he had determined to follow her down to the sea where she had said so maliciously that she was going after a second almost sleepless night he had no longer any hesitation he must see her after all a man might go to his own place with impunity he did not care if it were a pointed thing to do pointed the more pointed the better there was beginning to be roused in him an ugly stubbornness of male determination she should not escape him  but now that he was walking at her side all that determination and assurance melted to perplexed humility he marched along by his horse with his head down just feeling the ache of being so close to her and yet so far angry with his own silence and awkwardness almost angry with her for her loveliness and the pain it made him suffer when they reached the house and she left him at the stableyard saying she was going to get some flowers he jerked the beasts bridle and swore at it for its slowness in entering the stable he was terrified that she would be gone before he could get into the garden yet half afraid of finding her there but she was still plucking carnations by the box hedge which led to the conservatories and as she rose from gathering those blossoms before he knew what he was doing harbinger had thrown his arm around her held her as in a vice kissed her unmercifully  she seemed to offer no resistance her smooth cheeks growing warmer and warmer even her lips passive but suddenly he recoiled and his heart stood still at his own outrageous daring what had he done he saw her leaning back almost buried in the clipped box hedge and heard her say with a sort of faint mockery well  he would have flung himself down on his knees to ask for pardon but for the thought that someone might come he muttered hoarsely by god i was mad and stood glowering in sullen suspense between hardihood and fear he heard her say quietly  yes you wererather  then seeing her put her hand up to her lips as if he had hurt them he muttered brokenly  forgive me babs  there was a full minutes silence while he stood there no longer daring to look at her beaten all over by his emotions then with bewilderment he heard her say  i didnt mind itfor once  he looked up at that how could she love him and speak so coolly how could she not mind if she did not love him she was passing her hands over her face and neck and hair repairing the damage of his kisses  now shall we go in she said  harbinger took a step forward  i love you so he said i will put my life in your hands and you shall throw it away  at those words of whose exact nature he had very little knowledge he saw her smile  if i let you come within three yards will you be good  he bowed and in silence they walked towards the house  dinner that evening was a strange uncomfortable meal but its comedy too subtly played for miltoun and lord dennis seemed transparent to the eyes of lady casterley for when harbinger had sallied forth to ride back along the sands she took her candle and invited barbara to retire then having admitted her granddaughter to the apartment always reserved for herself and specially furnished with practically nothing she sat down opposite that tall young solid figure as it were taking stock of it and said  so you are coming to your senses at all events kiss me  barbara stooping to perform this rite saw a tear stealing down the carved fine nose knowing that to notice it would be too dreadful she raised herself and went to the window there staring out over the dark fields and dark sea by the side of which harbinger was riding home she put her hand up to her lips and thought for the hundredth time  so thats what its like     chapter vi  three days after his first and as he promised himself his last society ball courtier received a note from audrey noel saying that she had left monkland for the present and come up to a little flaton the riverside not far from westminster  when he made his way there that same july day the houses of parliament were bright under a sun which warmed all the grave air emanating from their counsels of perfection courtier passed by dubiously his feelings in the presence of those towers were always a little mixed there was not so much of the poet in him as to cause him to see nothing there at all save only same lines against the sky but there was enough of the poet to make him long to kick something and in this mood he wended his way to the riverside  mrs noel was not at home but since the maid informed him that she would be in directly he sat down to wait her flat which was onthe first floor overlooked the river and had evidently been taken furnished for there were visible marks of a recent struggle with an edwardian taste which flushed from triumph over victorianism had filled the rooms with early georgian remains on the only definite victory a rosecoloured window seat of great comfort and little age courtier sat down and resigned himself to doing nothing with the ease of an old soldier  to the protective feeling he had once had for a very graceful darkhaired child he joined not only the championing pity of a man of warm heart watching a woman in distress but the impatience of one who though temperamentally incapable of feeling oppressed himself rebelled at sight of all forms of tyranny affecting others  the sight of the grey towers still just visible under which miltoun and his father sat annoyed him deeply symbolizing to him authorityfoe to his deathless mistress the sweet invincible lost cause of liberty but presently the river bringing up in flood the unbound water that had bathed every shore touched all sands and seen the rising and falling of each mortal star so soothed him with its soundless hymn to freedom that audrey noel coming in with her hands full of flowers found him sleeping firmly with his mouth shut  noiselessly putting down the flowers she waited for his awakening that sanguine visage with its prominent chin flaring moustaches and eyebrows raised rather vshaped above his closed eyes wore an expression of cheery defiance even in sleep and perhaps no face in all london was so utterly its obverse as that of this dark softhaired woman delicate passive and tremulous with pleasure at sight of the only person in the world from whom she felt she might learn of miltoun without losing her selfrespect  he woke at last and manifesting no discomfiture said  it was like you not to wake me  they sat for a long while talking the riverside traffic drowsily accompanying their voices the flowers drowsily filling the room with scent and when courtier left his heart was sore she had not spoken of herself at all but had talked nearly all the time of barbara praising her beauty and high spirit growing pale once or twice and evidently drinking in with secret avidity every allusion to miltoun clearly her feelings had not changed though she would not show them courtiers pity for her became wellnigh violent  it was in such a mood mingled with very different feelings that he donned evening clothes and set out to attend the last gathering of the season at valleys house a function which held so late in july was perforce almost perfectly political  mounting the wide and shining staircase that had so often baffled the arithmetic of little ann he was reminded of a picture entitled the steps to heaven in his nursery fourandthirty years before at the top of this staircase and surrounded by acquaintances he came on harbinger who nodded curtly the young mans handsome face and figure appeared to courtiers jaundiced eye more obviously successful and complacent than ever so that he passed him by sardonically and manoeuvred his way towards lady valleys whom he could perceive stationed like a general in a little cleared space where to and fro flowed constant streams of people like the rays of a star she was looking her very best going well with great and highlypolished spaces and she greeted courtier with a special cordiality of tone which had in it besides kindness towards one who must be feeling a strange bird a certain diplomatic quality compounded of desire as it were to warn him off and fear of saying something that might irritate and make him more dangerous she had heard she said that he was bound for persia she hoped he was not going to try and make things more difficult there then with the words so good of you to have come she became once more the centre of her battlefield  perceiving that he was finished with courtier stood back against a wall and watched thus isolated he was like a solitary cuckoo contemplating the gyrations of a flock of rooks their motions seemed a little meaningless to one so far removed from all the fetishes and shibboleths of westminster he heard them discussing miltouns speech the real significance of which apparently had only just been grasped the words doctrinaire extremist came to his ears together with the saying a new force people were evidently puzzled disturbed not pleasedas if some star not hitherto accounted for had suddenly appeared amongst the proper constellations  searching this crowd for barbara courtier had all the time an uneasy sense of shame what business had he to come amongst these people so strange to him just for the sake of seeing her what business had he to be hankering after this girl at all knowing in his heart that he could not stand the atmosphere she lived in for a week and that she was utterly unsuited for any atmosphere that he could give her to say nothing of the unlikelihood that he could flutter the pulses of one half his age  a voice behind him said mr courtier  he turned and there was barbara  i want to talk to you about something serious will you come into the picture gallery  when at last they were close to a family group of georgian caradocs and could as it were shut out the throng sufficiently for private speech she began  miltouns so horribly unhappy i dont know what to do for him hes making himself ill  and she suddenly looked up in courtiers face she seemed to him very young and touching at that moment her eyes had a gleam of faith in them like a childs eyes as if she relied on him to straighten out this tangle to tell her not only about miltouns trouble but about all life its meaning and the secret of its happiness and he said gently  what can i do mrs noel is in town but thats no good unless not knowing how to finish this sentence he was silent  i wish i were miltoun she muttered  at that quaint saying courtier was hard put to it not to take hold of the hands so close to him this flash of rebellion in her had quickened all his blood but she seemed to have seen what had passed in him for her next speech was chilly  its no good stupid of me to be worrying you  it is quite impossible for you to worry me  her eyes lifted suddenly from her glove and looked straight into his  are you really going to persia  yes  but i dont want you to not yet and turning suddenly she left him  strangely disturbed courtier remained motionless consulting the grave stare of the group of georgian caradocs  a voice said  good painting isnt it  behind him was lord harbinger and once more the memory of lady casterleys words the memory of the two figures with joined hands on the balcony above the election crowd all his latent jealousy of this handsome young colossus his animus against one whom he could as it were smell out to be always fighting on the winning side all his consciousness too of what a lost cause his own was his doubt whether he were honourable to look on it as a cause at all flared up in courtier so that his answer was a stare on harbingers face too there had come a look of stubborn violence slowly working up towards the surface  i said good isnt it mr courtier  i heard you  and you were pleased to answer  nothing  with the civility which might be expected of your habits  coldly disdainful courtier answered  if you want to say that sort of thing please choose a place where i can reply to you and turned abruptly on his heel  but he ground his teeth as he made his way out into the street  in hyde park the grass was parched and dewless under a sky whose stars were veiled by the heat and dust haze never had courtier so bitterly wanted the skys consolationthe blessed sense of insignificance in the face of the nights dark beauty which dwarfing all petty rage and hunger made men part of its majesty exalted them to a sense of greatness     chapter vii  it was past four oclock the following day when barbara issued from valleys house on foot clad in a pale buff frock chosen for quietness she attracted every eye very soon entering a taxicab she drove to the temple stopped at the strand entrance and walked down the little narrow lane into the heart of the law its votaries were hurrying back from the courts streaming up from their chambers for tea or escaping desperately to lords or the parkyoung votaries unbound as yet by the fascination of fame or fees and each as he passed looked at barbara with his fingers itching to remove his hat and a feeling that this was she after a day spent amongst precedents and practice after six hours at least of trying to discover what chance a had of standing on his rights or b had of preventing him it was difficult to feel otherwise about that calm apparitionlike a golden slim tree walking one of them asked by her the way to miltouns staircase preceded her with shy ceremony and when she had vanished up those dusty stairs lingered on hoping that she might find her visitee out and be obliged to return and ask him the way back but she did not come and he went sadly away disturbed to the very bottom of all that he owned in fee simple  in fact no one answered barbaras knock and discovering that the door yielded she walked through the lobby past the clerks den converted to a kitchen into the sittingroom it was empty she had never been to miltouns rooms before and she stared about her curiously since he did not practise much of the proper gear was absent the room indeed had a worn carpet a few old chairs and was lined from floor to ceiling with books but the wall space between the windows was occupied by an enormous map of england scored all over with figures and crosses and before this map stood an immense desk on which were piles of double foolscap covered with miltouns neat and rather pointed writing barbara examined them puckering up her forehead she knew that he was working at a book on the land question but she had never realized that the making of a book requited so much writing papers too and blue books littered a large bureau on which stood bronze busts of aeschylus and dante  what an uncomfortable place she thought the room indeed had an atmosphere a spirit which depressed her horribly seeing a few flowers down in the court below she had a longing to get out to them then behind her she heard the sound of someone talking but there was no one in the room and the effect of this disrupted soliloquy which came from nowhere was so uncanny that she retreated to the door the sound as of two spirits speaking in one voice grew louder and involuntarily she glanced at the busts they seemed quite blameless though the sound had been behind her when she was at the window it was again behind her now that she was at the door and she suddenly realized that it was issuing from a bookcase in the centre of the wall barbara had her fathers nerve and walking up to the bookcase she perceived that it had been affixed to and covered a door that was not quite closed she pulled it towards her and passed through across the centre of an unkempt bedroom miltoun was striding dressed only in his shirt and trousers his feet were bare and his head and hair dripping wet the look on his thin dark face went to barbaras heart she ran forward and took his hand this was burning hot but the sight of her seemed to have frozen his tongue and eyes and the contrast of his burning hand with this frozen silence frightened barbara horribly she could think of nothing but to put her other hand to his forehead that too was burning hot  what brought you here he said  she could only murmur  oh eusty are you ill  miltoun took hold of her wrists  its all right ive been working too hard got a touch of fever  so i can feel murmured barbara you ought to be in bed come home with me  miltoun smiled its not a case for leeches  the look of his smile the sound of his voice sent a shudder through her  im not going to leave you here alone  but miltouns grasp tightened on her wrists  my dear babs you will do what i tell you go home hold your tongue and leave me to burn out in peace  barbara sustained that painful grip without wincing she had regained her calmness  you must come you havent anything here not even a cool drink  my god barley water  the scorn he put into those two words was more withering than a whole philippic against redemption by creature comforts and feeling it dart into her barbara closed her lips tight he had dropped her wrists and again begun pacing up and down suddenly he stopped          the stars sun moon all shrink away                a desert vast without a bound           and nothing left to eat or drink                 and a dark desert all around  you should read your blake audrey  barbara turned quickly and went out frightened she passed through the sittingroom and corridor on to the staircase he was illraving the fever in miltouns veins seemed to have stolen through the clutch of his hands into her own veins her face was burning she thought confusedly breathed unevenly she felt sore and at the same time terribly sorry and withal there kept rising in her the gusty memory of harbingers kiss  she hurried down the stairs turned by instinct downhill and found herself on the embankment and suddenly with her inherent power of swift decision she hailed a cab and drove to the nearest telephone office     chapter viii  to a woman like audrey noel born to be the counterpart and complement of anotherwhose occupations and effort were inherently divorced from the continuity of any stiff and strenuous purpose of her own the uprooting she had voluntarily undergone was a serious matter  bereaved of the faces of her flowers the friendly sighing of her limetree the wants of her cottagers bereaved of that busy monotony of little home things which is the stay and solace of lonely women she was extraordinarily lost even music for review seemed to have failed her she had never lived in london so that she had not the refuge of old haunts and habits but had to make her ownand to make habits and haunts required a heart that could at least stretch out feelers and lay hold of things and her heart was not now able when she had struggled with her edwardian flat and laid down her simple routine of meals she was as stranded as ever was convict let out of prison she had not even that great support the necessity of hiding her feelings for fear of disturbing others she was planted there with her longing and grief and nothing nobody to take her out of herself having wilfully embraced this position she tried to make the best of it feeling it less intolerable at all events than staying on at monkland where she had made that grievous and unpardonable errorfalling in love  this offence on the part of one who felt within herself a great capacity to enjoy and to confer happiness had arisenlike the other grievous and unpardonable offence her marriagefrom too much disposition to yield herself to the personality of another but it was cold comfort to know that the desire to give and to receive love had twice over left hera dead woman whatever the nature of those immature sensations with which as a girl of twenty she had accepted her husband in her feeling towards miltoun there was not only abandonment but the higher flame of selfrenunciation she wanted to do the best for him and had not even the consolation of the knowledge that she had sacrificed herself for his advantage all had been taken out of her hands yet with characteristic fatalism she did not feel rebellious if it were ordained that she should for fifty perhaps sixty years repent in sterility and ashes that first error of her girlhood rebellion was none the less too farfetched if she rebelled it would not be in spirit but in action general principles were nothing to her she lost no force brooding over the justice or injustice of her situation but merely tried to digest its facts  the whole day succeeding courtiers visit was spent by her in the national gallery whose roof alone of all in london seemed to offer her protection she had found one painting by an italian master the subject of which reminded her of miltoun and before this she sat for a very long time attracting at last the gouty stare of an official the still figure of this lady with the oval face and grave beauty both piqued his curiosity and stimulated certain moral qualms she was undoubtedly waiting for her lover no woman in his experience had ever sat so long before a picture without ulterior motive and he kept his eyes well opened to see what this motive would be like it gave him therefore a sensation almost amounting to chagrin when coming round once more he found they had eluded him and gone off together without coming under his inspection feeling his feet a good deal for he had been on them all day he sat down in the hollow which she had left behind her and against his will found himself also looking at the picture it was painted in a style he did not care for the face of the subject too gave him the queer feeling that the gentleman was being roasted inside he had not been sitting there long however before he perceived the lady standing by the picture and the lips of the gentleman in the picture moving it seemed to him against the rules and he got up at once and went towards it but as he did so he found that his eyes were shut and opened them hastily there was no one there  from the national gallery audrey had gone into an abc for tea and then home before the mansions was a taxicab and the maid met her with the news that lady caradoc was in the sittingroom  barbara was indeed standing in the middle of the room with a look on her face such as her father wore sometimes on the racecourse in the hunting field or at stormy cabinet meetings a look both resolute and sharp she spoke at once  i got your address from mr courtier my brother is ill im afraid itll be brain fever i think you had better go and see him at his rooms in the temple theres no time to be lost  to audrey everything in the room seemed to go round yet all her senses were preternaturally acute so that she could distinctly smell the mud of the river at low tide she said with a shudder  oh i will go yes i will go at once  hes quite alone he hasnt asked for you but i think your going is the only chance he took me for you you told me once you were a good nurse  yes  the room was steady enough now but she had lost the preternatural acuteness of her senses and felt confused she heard barbara say i can take you to the door in my cab and murmuring i will get ready went into her bedroom for a moment she was so utterly bewildered that she did nothing then every other thought was lost in a strange soft almost painful delight as if some new instinct were being born in her and quickly but without confusion or hurry she began packing she put into a valise her own toilet things then flannel cottonwool eau de cologne hotwater bottle etna shawls thermometer everything she had which could serve in illness changing to a plain dress she took up the valise and returned to barbara they went out together to the cab the moment it began to bear her to this ordeal at once so longedfor and so terrible fear came over her again so that she screwed herself into the corner very white and still she was aware of barbara calling to the driver go by the strand and stop at a poulterers for ice and when the bag of ice had been handed in heard her saying i will bring you all you wantif he is really going to be ill  then as the cab stopped and the open doorway of the staircase was before her all her courage came back  she felt the girls warm hand against her own and grasping her valise and the bag of ice got out and hurried up the steps     chapter ix  on leaving nettlefold miltoun had gone straight back to his rooms and begun at once to work at his book on the land question he worked all through that nighthis third night without sleep and all the following day in the evening feeling queer in the head he went out and walked up and down the embankment then fearing to go to bed and lie sleepless he sat down in his armchair falling asleep there he had fearful dreams and awoke unrefreshed after his bath he drank coffee and again forced himself to work by the middle of the day he felt dizzy and exhausted but utterly disinclined to eat he went out into the hot strand bought himself a necessary book and after drinking more coffee came back and again began to work at four oclock he found that he was not taking in the words his head was burning hot and he went into his bedroom to bathe it then somehow he began walking up and down talking to himself as barbara had found him  she had no sooner gone than he felt utterly exhausted a small crucifix hung over his bed and throwing himself down before it he remained motionless with his face buried in the coverlet and his arms stretched out towards the wall he did not pray but merely sought rest from sensation across his halfhypnotized consciousness little threads of burning fancy kept shooting then he could feel nothing but utter physical sickness and against this his will revolted he resolved that he would not be ill a ridiculous log for women to hang over but the moments of sickness grew longer and more frequent and to drive them away he rose from his knees and for some time again walked up and down then seized with vertigo he was obliged to sit on the bed to save himself from falling from being burning hot he had become deadly cold glad to cover himself with the bedclothes the heat soon flamed up in him again but with a sick mans instinct he did not throw off the clothes and stayed quite still the room seemed to have turned to a thick white substance like a cloud in which he lay enwrapped unable to move hand or foot his sense of smell and hearing had become unnaturally acute he smelled the distant streets flowers dust and the leather of his books even the scent left by barbaras clothes and a curious odour of river mud a clock struck six he counted each stroke and instantly the whole world seemed full of striking clocks the sound of horses hoofs bicycle bells peoples footfalls his sense of vision on the contrary was absorbed in consciousness of this white blanket of cloud wherein he was lifted above the earth in the midst of a dull incessant hammering on the surface of the cloud there seemed to be forming a number of little golden spots these spots were moving and he saw that they were toads then beyond them a huge face shaped itself very dark as if of bronze with eyes burning into his brain the more he struggled to get away from these eyes the more they bored and burned into him his voice was gone so that he was unable to cry out and suddenly the face marched over him  when he recovered consciousness his head was damp with moisture trickling from something held to his forehead by a figure leaning above him lifting his hand he touched a cheek and hearing a sob instantly suppressed he sighed his hand was gently taken he felt kisses on it  the room was so dark that he could scarcely see her facehis sight too was dim but he could hear her breathing and the least sound of her dress and movementsthe scent too of her hands and hair seemed to envelop him and in the midst of all the acute discomfort of his fever he felt the band round his brain relax he did not ask how long she had been there but lay quite still trying to keep his eyes on her for fear of that face which seemed lurking behind the air ready to march on him again then feeling suddenly that he could not hold it back he beckoned and clutched at her trying to cover himself with the protection of her breast this time his swoon was not so deep it gave way to delirium with intervals when he knew that she was there and by the shaded candle light could see her in a white garment floating close to him or sitting still with her hand on his he could even feel the faint comfort of the ice cap and of the scent of eau de cologne then he would lose all consciousness of her presence and pass through into the incoherent world where the crucifix above his bed seemed to bulge and hang out as if it must fall on him he conceived a violent longing to tear it down which grew till he had struggled up in bed and wrenched it from off the wall yet a mysterious consciousness of her presence permeated even his darkest journeys into the strange land and once she seemed to be with him where a strange light showed them fields and trees a dark line of moor and a bright sea all whitened and flashing with sweet violence  soon after dawn he had a long interval of consciousness and took in with a sort of wonder her presence in the low chair by his bed so still she sat in a white loose gown pale with watching her eyes immovably fixed on him her lips pressed together and quivering at his faintest motion he drank in desperately the sweetness of her face which had so lost remembrance of self     chapter x  barbara gave the news of her brothers illness to no one else common sense telling her to run no risk of disturbance of her own initiative she brought a doctor and went down twice a day to hear reports of miltouns progress  as a fact her father and mother had gone to lord dennis for goodwood and the chief difficulty had been to excuse her own neglect of that favourite meeting she had fallen back on the halftruth that eustace wanted her in town and since lord and lady valleys had neither of them shaken off a certain uneasiness about their son the pretext sufficed  it was not until the sixth day when the crisis was well past and miltoun quite free from fever that she again went down to nettlefold  on arriving she at once sought out her mother whom she found in her bedroom resting it had been very hot at goodwood  barbara was not afraid of hershe was not indeed afraid of anyone except miltoun and in some strange way a little perhaps of courtier yet when the maid had gone she did not at once begin her tale lady valleys who at goodwood had just heard details of a society scandal began a carefully expurgated account of it suitable to her daughters earsfor some account she felt she must give to somebody  mother said barbara suddenly eustace has been ill hes out of danger now and going on all right then looking hard at the bewildered lady she added mrs noel is nursing him  the past tense in which illness had been mentioned checking at the first moment any rush of panic in lady valleys left her confused by the situation conjured up in barbaras last words instead of feeding that part of man which loves a scandal she was being fed always an unenviable sensation a woman did not nurse a man under such circumstances without being everything to him in the worlds eyes her daughter went on  i took her to him it seemed the only thing to dosince its all through fretting for her nobody knows of course except the doctor andstacey  heavens muttered lady valleys  it has saved him  the mother instinct in lady valleys took sudden fright are you telling me the truth babs is he really out of danger how wrong of you not to let me know before  but barbara did not flinch and her mother relapsed into rumination  stacey is a cat she said suddenly the expurgated details of the scandal she had been retailing to her daughter had included the usual maid she could not find it in her to enjoy the irony of this coincidence then seeing barbara smile she said tartly  i fail to see the joke  only that i thought youd enjoy my throwing stacey in dear  what you mean she doesnt know  not a word  lady valleys smiled  what a little wretch you are babs maliciously she added claud and his mother are coming over from whitewater with bertie and lily malvezin youd better go and dress and her eyes searched her daughters so shrewdly that a flush rose to the girls cheeks  when she had gone lady valleys rang for her maid again and relapsed into meditation her first thought was to consult her husband her second that secrecy was strength since no one knew but barbara no one had better know  her astuteness and experience comprehended the farreaching probabilities of this affair it would not do to take a single false step if she had no ones action to control but her own and barbaras so much the less chance of a slip her mind was a strange medley of thoughts and feelings almost comic wellnigh tragic of worldly prudence and motherly instinct of warmblooded sympathy with all loveaffairs and coolblooded concern for her sons career it was not yet too late perhaps to prevent real mischief especially since it was agreed by everyone that the woman was no adventuress whatever was done they must not forget that she had nursed himsaved him barbara had said she must be treated with all kindness and consideration  hastening her toilette she in turn went to her daughters room  barbara was already dressed leaning out of her window towards the sea  lady valleys began almost timidly  my dear is eustace out of bed yet  he was to get up today for an hour or two  i see now would there be any danger if you and i went up and took charge over from mrs noel  poor eusty  yes yes but exercise your judgment would it harm him  barbara was silent no she said at last i dont suppose it would now but its for the doctor to say  lady valleys exhibited a manifest relief  well see him first of course eustace will have to have an ordinary nurse i suppose for a bit  looking stealthily at barbara she added  i mean to be very nice to her but one mustnt be romantic you know babs  from the little smile on barbaras lips she derived no sense of certainty indeed she was visited by all her late disquietude about her young daughter by all the feeling that she as well as miltoun was hovering on the verge of some folly  well my dear she said i am going down  but barbara lingered a little longer in that bedroom where ten nights ago she had lain tossing till in despair she went and cooled herself in the dark sea  her last little interview with courtier stood between her and a fresh meeting with harbinger whom at the valleys house gathering she had not suffered to be alone with her she came down late  that same evening out on the beach road under a sky swarming with stars the people were strollingfolk from the towns down for their fortnights holiday in twos and threes in parties of six or eight they passed the wall at the end of lord denniss little domain and the sound of their sparse talk and laughter together with the sighing of the young waves was blown over the wall to the ears of harbinger bertie barbara and lily malvezin when they strolled out after dinner to sniff the sea the holidaymakers stared dully at the four figures in evening dress looking out above their heads they had other things than these to think of becoming more and more silent as the night grew dark the four young people too were rather silent there was something in this warm night with its sighing and its darkness and its stars that was not favourable to talk so that presently they split into couples drifting a little apart  standing there gripping the wall it seemed to harbinger that there were no words left in the world not even his worst enemy could have called this young man romantic yet that figure beside him the gleam of her neck and her pale cheek in the dark gave him perhaps the most poignant glimpse of mystery that he had ever had his mind essentially that of a man of affairs by nature and by habit at home amongst the material aspects of things was but gropingly conscious that here in this dark night and the dark sea and the pale figure of this girl whose heart was dark to him and secret there was perhaps somethingyes somethingwhich surpassed the confines of his philosophy something beckoning him on out of his snug compound into the desert of divinity if so it was soon gone in the aching of his senses at the scent of her hair and the longing to escape from this weird silence  babs he said have you forgiven me  her answer came without turn of head natural indifferent  yesi told you so  is that all you have to say to a fellow  what shall we talk aboutthe running of casetta  deep down within him harbinger uttered a noiseless oath something sinister was making her behave like this to him it was that fellowthat fellow and suddenly he said  tell me this then speech seemed to stick in his throat no if there were anything in that he preferred not to hear it there was a limit  down below a pair of lovers passed very silent their arms round each others waists  barbara turned and walked away towards the house     chapter xi  the days when miltoun was first allowed out of bed were a time of mingled joy and sorrow to her who had nursed him to see him sitting up amazed at his own weakness was happiness yet to think that he would be no more wholly dependent no more that sacred thing a helpless creature brought her the sadness of a mother whose child no longer needs her with every hour he would now get farther from her back into the fastnesses of his own spirit with every hour she would be less his nurse and comforter more the woman he loved and though that thought shone out in the obscure future like a glamorous flower it brought too much wistful uncertainty to the present she was very tired too now that all excitement was overso tired that she hardly knew what she did or where she moved but a smile had become so faithful to her eyes that it clung there above the shadows of fatigue and kept taking her lips prisoner  between the two bronze busts she had placed a bowl of lilies of the valley and every free niche in that room of books had a little vase of roses to welcome miltouns return  he was lying back in his big leather chair wrapped in a turkish gown of lord valleyson which barbara had laid hands having failed to find anything resembling a dressinggown amongst her brothers austere clothing the perfume of lilies had overcome the scent of books and a bee dusky adventurer filled the room with his pleasant humming  they did not speak but smiled faintly looking at one another in this still moment before passion had returned to claim its own their spirits passed through the sleepy air and became entwined so that neither could withdraw that soft slow encountering glance in mutual contentment each to each close as music to the strings of a violin their spirits clungso lost the one in the other that neither for that brief time seemed to know which was self  in fulfilment of her resolution lady valleys who had returned to town by a morning train started with barbara for the temple about three in the after noon and stopped at the doctors on the way the whole thing would be much simpler if eustace were fit to be moved at once to valleys house and with much relief she found that the doctor saw no danger in this course the recovery had been remarkabletouch and go for bad brain fever just avoided lord miltouns constitution was extremely sound yes he would certainly favour a removal his rooms were too confined in this weather well nurseddecidedly oh yes quite and the doctors eyes became perhaps a trifle more intense not a professional he understood it might be as well to have another nurse if they were making the change they would have this lady knocking up just so yes he would see to that an ambulance carriage he thought advisable that could all be arranged for this afternoonat oncehe himself would look to it they might take lord miltoun off just as he was the men would know what to do and when they had him at valleys house the moment he showed interest in his food down to the seadown to the sea at this time of year nothing like it then with regard to nourishment he would be inclined already to shove in a leetle stimulant a thimbleful perhaps four times a day with foodnot withoutmixed with an egg with arrowroot with custard a week would see him on his legs a fortnight at the sea make him as good a man as ever overworkburning the candlea leetlemore would have seen a very different state of things quite so quite so would come round himself before dinner and make sure his patient might feel it just at first he bowed lady valleys out and when she had gone sat down at his telephone with a smile flickering on his cleancut lips  greatly fortified by this interview lady valleys rejoined her daughter in the ear but while it slid on amongst the multitudinous traffic signs of unwonted nervousness began to start out through the placidity of her face  i wish my dear she said suddenly that someone else had to do this suppose eustace refuses  he wont barbara answered she looks so tired poor dear besides  lady valleys gazed with curiosity at that young face which had flushed pink yes this daughter of hers was a woman already with all a womans intuitions she said gravely  it was a rash stroke of yours babs lets hope it wont lead to disaster  barbara bit her lips  if youd seen him as i saw him and what disaster maynt they love each other if they want  lady valleys swallowed a grimace it was so exactly her own point of view and yet  thats only the beginning she said you forget the sort of boy eustace is  why cant the poor thing be let out of her cage cried barbara what good does it do to anyone mother if ever when i am married i want to get free i will  the tone of her voice was so quivering and unlike the happy voice of barbara that lady valleys involuntarily caught hold of her hand and squeezed it hard  my dear sweet she said dont lets talk of such gloomy things  i mean it nothing shall stop me  but lady valleys face had suddenly become rather grim  so we think child its not so simple  it cant be worse anyway muttered barbara than being buried alive as that wretched woman is  for answer lady valleys only murmured  the doctor promised that ambulance carriage at four oclock what am i going to say  shell understand when you look at her shes that sort  the door was opened to them by mrs noel herself  it was the first time lady valleys had seen her in a house and there was real curiosity mixed with the assurance which masked her nervousness a pretty creature even lovely but the quite genuine sympathy in her words i am truly grateful you must be quite worn out did not prevent her adding hastily the doctor says he must be got home out of these hot rooms well wait here while you tell him  and then she saw that it was true this woman was the sort who understood  left in the dark passage she peered round at barbara  the girl was standing against the wall with her head thrown back lady valleys could not see her face but she felt all of a sudden exceedingly uncomfortable and whispered  two murders and a theft babs wasnt it our mutual friend  mother  what  her face when youre going to throw away a flower it looks at you  my dear murmured lady valleys thoroughly distressed what things youre saying today  this lurking in a dark passage this whispering girlit was all queer unlike an experience in proper life  and then through the reopened door she saw miltoun stretched out in a chair very pale but still with that look about his eyes and lips which of all things in the world had a chastening effect on lady valleys making her feel somehow incurably mundane  she said rather timidly  im so glad youre better dear what a time you must have had its too bad that i knew nothing till yesterday  but miltouns answer was as usual thoroughly disconcerting  thanks yes i have had a perfect timeand have now to pay for it i suppose  held back by his smile from bending to kiss him poor lady valleys fidgeted from head to foot a sudden impulse of sheer womanliness caused a tear to fall on his hand  when miltoun perceived that moisture he said  its all right mother im quite willing to come  still wounded by his voice lady valleys hardened instantly and while preparing for departure she watched the two furtively they hardly looked at one another and when they did their eyes baffled her the expression was outside her experience belonging as it were to a different world with its faintly smiling almost shining gravity  vastly relieved when miltoun covered with a fur had been taken down to the carriage she lingered to speak to mrs noel  we owe you a great debt it might have been so much worse you mustnt be disconsolate go to bed and have a good long rest and from the door she murmured again he will come and thank you when hes well  descending the stone stairs she thought anonymaanonymayes it was quite the name and suddenly she saw barbara come running up again  what is it babs  barbara answered  eustace would like some of those lilies and passing lady valleys she went on up to miltouns chambers  mrs noel was not in the sittingroom and going to the bedroom door the girl looked in  she was standing by the bed drawing her hand over and over the white surface of the pillow stealing noiselessly back barbara caught up the bunch of lilies and fled     chapter xii  miltoun whose constitution had the steellike quality of lady casterleys had a very rapid convalescence and having begun to take an interest in his food he was allowed to travel on the seventh day to sea house in charge of barbara  the two spent their time in a little summerhouse close to the sea lying out on the beach under the groynes and as miltoun grew stronger motoring and walking on the downs  to barbara keeping a close watch he seemed tranquilly enough drinking in from nature what was necessary to restore balance after the struggle and breakdown of the past weeks yet she could never get rid of a queer feeling that he was not really there at all to look at him was like watching an uninhabited house that was waiting for someone to enter  during a whole fortnight he did not make a single allusion to mrs noel till on the very last morning as they were watching the sea he said with his queer smile  it almost makes one believe her theory that the old gods are not dead do you ever see them babs or are you like me obtuse  certainly about those lithe invasions of the seanymph waves with ashy streaming hair flinging themselves into the arms of the land there was the old pagan rapture an inexhaustible delight a passionate soft acceptance of eternal fate a wonderful acquiescence in the untiring mystery of life  but barbara ever disconcerted by that tone in his voice and by this quick dive into the waters of unaccustomed thought failed to find an answer  miltoun went on  she says too we can hear apollo singing shall we try  but all that came was the sigh of the sea and of the wind in the tamarisk  no muttered miltoun at last she alone can hear it  and barbara saw once more on his face that look neither sad nor impatient but as of one uninhabited and waiting  she left sea house next day to rejoin her mother who having been to cowes and to the duchess of gloucesters was back in town waiting for parliament to rise before going off to scotland and that same afternoon the girl made her way to mrs noels flat in paying this visit she was moved not so much by compassion as by uneasiness and a strange curiosity now that miltoun was well again she was seriously disturbed in mind had she made a mistake in summoning mrs noel to nurse him  when she went into the little drawingroom audrey was sitting in the deepcushioned windowseat with a book on her knee and by the fact that it was open at the index barbara judged that she had not been reading too attentively she showed no signs of agitation at the sight of her visitor nor any eagerness to hear news of miltoun but the girl had not been five minutes in the room before the thought came to her why she has the same look as eustace she too was like an empty tenement without impatience discontent or griefwaiting barbara had scarcely realized this with a curious sense of discomposure when courtier was announced whether there was in this an absolute coincidence or just that amount of calculation which might follow on his part from receipt of a note written from sea housesaying that miltoun was well again that she was coming up and meant to go and thank mrs noelwas not clear nor were her own sensations and she drew over her face that armoured look which she perhaps knew courtier could not bear to see his face at all events was very red when he shook hands he had come he told mrs noel to say goodbye he was definitely off next week fighting had broken out the revolutionaries were greatly outnumbered indeed he ought to have been there long before  barbara had gone over to the window she turned suddenly and said  you were preaching peace two months ago  courtier bowed  we are not all perfectly consistent lady barbara these poor devils have a holy cause  barbara held out her hand to mrs noel  you only think their cause holy because they happen to be weak goodbye mrs noel the world is meant for the strong isnt it  she intended that to hurt him and from the tone of his voice she knew it had  dont lady barbara from your mother yes not from you  its what i believe goodbye and she went out  she had told him that she did not want him to gonot yet and he was going  but no sooner had she got outside after that strange outburst than she bit her lips to keep back an angry miserable feeling he had been rude to her she had been rude to him that was the way they had said goodbye then as she emerged into the sunlight she thought oh well he doesnt care and im sure i dont  she heard a voice behind her  may i get you a cab and at once the sore feeling began to die away but she did not look round only smiled and shook her head and made a little room for him on the pavement  but though they walked they did not at first talk there was rising within barbara a tantalizing devil of desire to know the feelings that really lay behind that deferential gravity to make him show her how much he really cared she kept her eyes demurely lowered but she let the glimmer of a smile flicker about her lips she knew too that her cheeks were glowing and for that she was not sorry was she not to have anyanywas he calmly to go awaywithoutand she thought he shall say something he shall show me without that horrible irony of his  she said suddenly  those two are just waitingsomething will happen  it is probable was his grave answer  she looked at him thenit pleased her to see him quiver as if that glance had gone right into him and she said softly  and i think they will be quite right  she knew those were reckless words nor cared very much what they meant but she knew the revolt in them would move him she saw from his face that it had and after a little pause said  happiness is the great thing and with soft wicked slowness isnt it mr courtier  but all the cheeriness had gone out of his face which had grown almost pale he lifted his hand and let it drop then she felt sorry it was just as if he had asked her to spare him  as to that he said the rough unfortunately has to be taken with the smooth but lifes frightfully jolly sometimes  as now  he looked at her with firm gravity and answered  as now  a sense of utter mortification seized on barbara he was too strong for herhe was quixotiche was hateful and determined not to show a sign to be at least as strong as he she said calmly  now i think ill have that cab  when she was in the cab and he was standing with his hat lifted she looked at him in the way that women can so that he did not realize that she had looked     chapter xiii  when miltoun came to thank her audrey noel was waiting in the middle of the room dressed in white her lips smiling her dark eyes smiling still as a flower on a windless day  in that first look passing between them they forgot everything but happiness swallows on the first day of summer in their discovery of the bland air can neither remember that cold winds blow nor imagine the death of sunlight on their feathers and flitting hour after hour over the golden fields seem no longer birds but just the breathing of a new seasonswallows were no more forgetful of misfortune than were those two his gaze was as still as her very self her look at him had in at the quietude of all emotion  when they sat down to talk it was as if they had gone back to those days at monkland when he had come to her so often to discuss everything in heaven and earth and yet over that tranquil eager drinkingin of each others presence hovered a sort of awe it was the mood of morning before the sun has soared the dewgrey cobwebs enwrapped the flowers of their heartsyet every prisoned flower could be seen and he and she seemed looking through that web at the colour and the deepdown forms enshrouded so jealously each feared too much to unveil the others heart they were like lovers who rambling in a shy wood never dare stay their babbling talk of the trees and birds and lost bluebells lest in the deep waters of a kiss their star of all that is to come should fall and be drowned to each hour its familiarand the spirit of that hour was the spirit of the white flowers in the bowl on the windowsill above her head  they spoke of monkland and miltouns illness of his first speech his impressions of the house of commons of music barbara courtier the river he told her of his health and described his days down by the sea she as ever spoke little of herself persuaded that it could not interest even him but she described a visit to the opera and how she had found a picture in the national gallery which reminded her of him to all these trivial things and countless others the tone of their voicessoft almost murmuring with a sort of delighted gentlenessgave a high sweet importance a halo that neither for the world would have dislodged from where it hovered  it was past six when he got up to go and there had not been a moment to break the calm of that sacred feeling in both their hearts they parted with another tranquil look which seemed to say it is well with uswe have drunk of happiness  and in this same amazing calm miltoun remained after he had gone away till about halfpast nine in the evening he started forth to walk down to the house it was now that sort of warm clear night which in the country has firefly magic and even over the town spreads a dark glamour and for miltoun in the delight of his new health and wellbeing with every sense alive and clean to walk through the warmth and beauty of this night was sheer pleasure he passed by way of st jamess park treading down the purple shadows of planetree leaves into the pools of lamplight almost with remorseso beautiful and as if alive were they there were moths abroad and gnats born on the water and scent of newmown grass drifted up from the lawns his heart felt light as a swallow he had seen that morning swooping at a grey feather carrying it along letting it flutter away then diving to seize it again such was his elation this beautiful night nearing the house of commons he thought he would walk a little longer and turned westward to the river on that warm evening the water without movement at turn of tide was like the black snakesmooth hair of nature streaming out on her couch of earth waiting for the caress of a divine hand far away on the further bank throbbed some huge machine not stilled as yet a few stars were out in the dark sky but no moon to invest with pallor the gleam of the lamps scarcely anyone passed miltoun strolled along the river wall then crossed and came back in front of the mansions where she lived by the railing he stood still in the sittingroom of her little flat there was no light but the casement window was wide open and the crown of white flowers in the bowl on the windowsill still gleamed out in the darkness like a crescent moon lying on its face suddenly he saw two pale hands riseone on either side of that bowl lift it and draw it in and he quivered as though they had touched him again those two hands came floating up they were parted now by darkness the moon of flowers was gone in its place had been set handfuls of purple or crimson blossoms and a puff of warm air rising quickly out of the night drifted their scent of cloves into his face so that he held his breath for fear of calling out her name  again the hands had vanishedthrough the open window there was nothing to be seen but darkness and such a rush of longing seized on miltoun as stole from him all power of movement he could hear her playing now the murmurous current of that melody was like the night itself sighing throbbing languorously soft it seemed that in this music she was calling him telling him that she too was longing her heart too empty it died away and at the window her white figure appeared from that vision he could not nor did he try to shrink but moved out into the lamplight and he saw her suddenly stretch out her hands to him and withdraw them to her breast then all save the madness of his longing deserted miltoun he ran down the little garden across the hall up the stairs  the door was open he passed through there in the sittingroom where the red flowers in the window scented all the air it was dark and he could not at first see her till against the piano he caught the glimmer of her white dress she was sitting with hands resting on the pale notes and falling on his knees he buried his face against her then without looking up he raised his hands her tears fell on them covering her heart that throbbed as if the passionate night itself were breathing in there and all but the night and her love had stolen forth     chapter xiv  on a spur of the sussex downs inland from nettlecold there stands a beechgrove the traveller who enters it out of the heat and brightness takes off the shoes of his spirit before its sanctity and reaching the centre across the clean beechmat he sits refreshing his brow with air and silence for the flowers of sunlight on the ground under those branches are pale and rare no insects hum the birds are almost mute and close to the border trees are the quiet milkwhite sheep in congregation escaping from noon heat here above fields and dwellings above the ceaseless network of mens doings and the vapour of their talk the traveller feels solemnity all seems conveying divinitythe great white clouds moving their wings above him the faint longing murmur of the boughs and in far distance the sea and for a space his restlessness and fear know the peace of god  so it was with miltoun when he reached this temple three days after that passionate night having walked for hours alone and full of conflict during those three days he had been borne forward on the flood tide and now tearing himself out of london where to think was impossible he had come to the solitude of the downs to walk and face his new position  for that position he saw to be very serious in the flush of full realization there was for him no question of renunciation she was his he hers that was determined but what then was he to do there was no chance of her getting free in her husbands view it seemed under no circumstances was marriage dissoluble nor indeed to miltoun would divorce have made things easier believing as he did that he and she were guilty and that for the guilty there could be no marriage she it was true asked nothing but just to be his in secret and that was the course he knew most men would take without further thought there was no material reason in the world why he should not so act and maintain unchanged every other current of his life it would be easy usual and with her faculty for selfeffacement he knew she would not be unhappy but conscience in miltoun was a terrible and fierce thing in the delirium of his illness it had become that great face which had marched over him and though during the weeks of his recuperation struggle of all kind had ceased now that he had yielded to his passion conscience in a new and dismal shape had crept up again to sit above his heart he must and would let this man her husband know but even if that caused no open scandal could he go on deceiving those who if they knew of an illicit love would no longer allow him to be their representative if it were known that she was his mistress he could no longer maintain his position in public lifewas he not therefore in honour bound of his own accord to resign it night and day he was haunted by the thought how can i living in defiance of authority pretend to authority over my fellows how can i remain in public life but if he did not remain in public life what was he to do that way of life was in his blood he had been bred and born into it had thought of nothing else since he was a boy there was no other occupation or interest that could hold him for a momenthe saw very plainly that he would be cast away on the waters of existence  so the battle raged in his proud and twisted spirit which took everything so hardhis nature imperatively commanding him to keep his work and his power for usefulness his conscience telling him as urgently that if he sought to wield authority he must obey it  he entered the beechgrove at the height of this misery flaming with rebellion against the dilemma which fate had placed before him visited by gusts of resentment against a passion which forced him to pay the price either of his career or of his selfrespect gusts followed by remorse that he could so for one moment regret his love for that tender creature the face of lucifer was not more dark more tortured than miltouns face in the twilight of the grove above those kingdoms of the world for which his ambition and his conscience fought he threw himself down among the trees and stretching out his arms by chance touched a beetle trying to crawl over the grassless soil some bird had maimed it he took the little creature up the beetle truly could no longer work but it was spared the fate lying before himself the beetle was not as he would be when his power of movement was destroyed conscious of his own wasted life the world would not roll away down there he would still see himself cumbering the ground when his powers were taken from him this thought was torture why had he been suffered to meet her to love her and to be loved by her what had made him so certain from the first moment if she were not meant for him if he lived to be a hundred he would never meet another why because of his love must he bury the will and force of a man if there were no more coherence in gods scheme than this let him too be incoherent let him hold authority and live outside authority why stifle his powers for the sake of a coherence which did not exist that would indeed be madness greater than that of a mad world  there was no answer to his thoughts in the stillness of the grove unless it were the cooing of a dove or the faint thudding of the sheep issuing again into sunlight but slowly that stillness stole into miltouns spirit is it like this in the grave he thought are the boughs of those trees the dark earth over me and the sound in them the sound the dead hear when flowers are growing and the wind passing through them and is the feel of this earth how it feels to lie looking up for ever at nothing is life anything but a nightmare a dream and is not this the reality and why my fury my insignificant flame blowing here and there when there is really no wind only a shroud of still air and these flowers of sunlight that have been dropped on me why not let my spirit sleep instead of eating itself away with rage why not resign myself at once to wait for the substance of which this is but the shadow  and he lay scarcely breathing looking up at the unmoving branches setting with their darkness the pearls of the sky  is not peace enough he thought is not love enough can i not be reconciled like a woman is not that salvation and happiness what is all the rest but sound and fury signifying nothing  and as though afraid to lose his hold of that thought he got up and hurried from the grove  the whole wide landscape of field and wood cut by the pale roads was glimmering under the afternoon sun here was no wild windswept land gleaming red and purple and guarded by the grey rocks no home of the winds and the wild gods it was all serene and silvergolden in place of the shrill wailing pipe of the hunting buzzardhawks half lost up in the wind invisible larks were letting fall hymns to tranquillity and even the seano adventuring spirit sweeping the shore with its wingseemed to lie resting by the side of the land     chapter xv  when on the afternoon of that same day miltoun did not come all the chilly doubts which his presence alone kept away crowded thick and fast into the mind of one only too prone to distrust her own happiness it could not lasthow could it  his nature and her own were so far apart even in that giving of herself which had been such happiness she had yet doubted for there was so much in him that was to her mysterious all that he loved in poetry and nature had in it something craggy and culminating the soft and fiery the subtle and harmonious seemed to leave him cold he had no particular love for all those simple natural things birds bees animals trees and flowers that seemed to her precious and divine  though it was not yet four oclock she was already beginning to droop like a flower that wants water but she sat down to her piano resolutely till tea came playing on and on with a spirit only half present the other half of her wandering in the town seeking for miltoun after tea she tried first to read then to sew and once more came back to her piano the clock struck six and as if its last stroke had broken the armour of her mind she felt suddenly sick with anxiety why was he so long but she kept on playing turning the pages without taking in the notes haunted by the idea that he might again have fallen ill should she telegraph what good when she could not tell in the least where he might be and all the unreasoning terror of not knowing where the loved one is beset her so that her hands in sheer numbness dropped from the keys unable to keep still now she wandered from window to door out into the little hall and back hastily to the window over her anxiety brooded a darkness compounded of vague growing fears what if it were the end what if he had chosen this as the most merciful way of leaving her but surely he would never be so cruel close on the heels of this too painful thought came reaction and she told herself that she was a fool he was at the house something quite ordinary was keeping him it was absurd to be anxious she would have to get used to this now to be a drag on him would be dreadful sooner than that she would ratheryesrather he never came back and she took up her book determined to read quietly till he came but the moment she sat down her fears returned with redoubled forcethe cold sickly horrible feeling of uncertainty of the knowledge that she could do nothing but wait till she was relieved by something over which she had no control and in the superstition that to stay there in the window where she could see him come was keeping him from her she went into her bedroom from there she could watch the sunset clouds winedark over the river a little talking wind shivered along the houses the dusk began creeping in she would not turn on the light unwilling to admit that it was really getting late but began to change her dress lingering desperately over every little detail of her toilette deriving therefrom a faint mysterious comfort trying to make herself feel beautiful from sheer dread of going back before he came she let her hair fall though it was quite smooth and tidy and began brushing it suddenly she thought with horror of her efforts at adornmentby specially preparing for him she must seem presumptuous to fate at any little sound she stopped and stood listeningsave for her hair and eyes as white from head to foot as a double narcissus flower in the dusk bending towards some faint tune played to it somewhere oft in the fields but all those little sounds ceased one after anotherthey had meant nothing and each time her spirit returningwithin the pale walls of the room began once more to inhabit her lingering fingers during that hour in her bedroom she lived through years it was dark when she left it     chapter xvi  when miltoun at last came it was past nine oclock  silent but quivering all over she clung to him in the hall and this passion of emotion without sound to give it substance affected him profoundly how terribly sensitive and tender she was she seemed to have no armour but though so stirred by her emotion he was none the less exasperated she incarnated at that moment the life to which he must now resign himselfa life of unending tenderness consideration and passivity  for a long time he could not bring himself to speak of his decision every look of her eyes every movement of her body seemed pleading with him to keep silence but in miltouns character there was an element of rigidity which never suffered him to diverge from an objective once determined  when he had finished telling her she only said  why cant we go on in secret  and he felt with a sort of horror that he must begin his struggle over again he got up and threw open the window the sky was dark above the river the wind had risen that restless murmuration and the width of the night with its scattered stars seemed to come rushing at his face he withdrew from it and leaning on the sill looked down at her what flowerlike delicacy she had there flashed across him the memory of a drooping blossom which in the spring he had seen her throw into the flames with the words i cant bear flowers to fade i always want to burn them he could see again those waxen petals yield to the fierce clutch of the little red creeping sparks and the slender stalk quivering and glowing and writhing to blackness like a live thing and distraught he began  i cant live a lie what right have i to lead if i cant follow im not like our friend courtier who believes in liberty i never have i never shall liberty what is liberty but only those who conform to authority have the right to wield authority a man is a churl who enforces laws when he himself has not the strength to observe them i will not be one of whom it can be said he can rule others himself  no one will know  miltoun turned away  i shall know he said but he saw clearly that she did not understand him her face had a strange brooding shutaway look as though he had frightened her and the thought that she could not understand angered him  he said stubbornly no i cant remain in public life  but what has it to do with politics its such a little thing  if it had been a little thing to me should i have left you at monkland and spent those five weeks in purgatory before my illness a little thing  she exclaimed with sudden fire  circumstances aye the little thing its love thats the great thing  miltoun stared at her for the first time understanding that she had a philosophy as deep and stubborn as his own but he answered cruelly  well the great thing has conquered me  and then he saw her looking at him as if seeing into the recesses of his soul she had made some ghastly discovery the look was so mournful so uncannily intent that he turned away from it  perhaps it is a little thing he muttered i dont know i cant see my way ive lost my bearings i must find them again before i can do anything  but as if she had not heard or not taken in the sense of his words she said again  oh dont let us alter anything i wont ever want what you cant give  and this stubbornness when he was doing the very thing that would give him to her utterly seemed to him unreasonable  ive had it out with myself he said dont lets talk about it any more  again with a sort of dry anguish she murmured  no no let us go on as we are  feeling that he had borne all he could miltoun put his hands on her shoulders and said thats enough  then in sudden remorse he lifted her and clasped her to him  but she stood inert in his arms her eyes closed not returning his kisses     chapter xvii  on the last day before parliament rose lord valleys with a light heart mounted his horse for a gallop in the row though she was a blood mare he rode her with a plain snaffle having the horsemanship of one who has hunted from the age of seven and been for twenty years a colonel of yeomanry greeting affably everyone he knew he maintained a frank demeanour on all subjects especially of government policy secretly enjoying the surmises and prognostications so pleasantly wide of the mark and the way questions and hints perished before his sphinxlike candour he spoke cheerily too of miltoun who was all right again and burning for the fray when the house met again in the autumn and he chaffed lord malvezin about his wife if anythinghe saidcould make bertie take an interest in politics it would be she he had two capital gallops being well known to the police the day was bright and he was sorry to turn home falling in with harbinger he asked him to come back to lunch there had seemed something different lately an almost morose look about young harbinger and his wifes disquieting words about barbara came back to lord valleys with a shock he had seen little of the child lately and in the general clearing up of this time of year had forgotten all about the matter  agatha who was still staying at valleys house with little ann waiting to travel up to scotland with her mother was out and there was no one at lunch except lady valleys and barbara herself conversation flagged for the young people were extremely silent lady valleys was considering the draft of a report which had to be settled before she left and lord valleys himself was rather carefully watching his daughter the news that lord miltoun was in the study came as a surprise and somewhat of a relief to all to an exhortation to luring him in to lunch the servant replied that lord miltoun had lunched and would wait  does he know theres no one here  yes my lady  lady valleys pushed back her plate and rose  oh well she said ive finished  lord valleys also got up and they went out together leaving barbara who had risen looking doubtfully at the door  lord valleys had recently been told of the nursing episode and had received the news with the dubious air of one hearing something about an eccentric person which heard about anyone else could have had but one significance if eustace had been a normal young man his father would have shrugged his shoulders and thought oh well there it is as it was he had literally not known what to think  and now crossing the saloon which intervened between the diningroom and the study he said to his wife uneasily  is it this woman again gertrudeor what  lady valleys answered with a shrug  goodness knows my dear  miltoun was standing in the embrasure of a window above the terrace he looked well and his greeting was the same as usual  well my dear fellow said lord valleys youre all right again evidentlywhats the news  only that ive decided to resign my seat  lord valleys stared  what on earth for  but lady valleys with the greater quickness of women divining already something of the reason had flushed a deep pink  nonsense my dear she said it cant possibly be necessary even if recovering herself she added dryly  give us some reason  the reason is simply that ive joined my life to mrs noels and i cant go on as i am living a lie if it were known i should obviously have to resign at once  good god exclaimed lord valleys  lady valleys made a rapid movement in the face of what she felt to be a really serious crisis between these two utterly different creatures of the other sex her husband and her son she had dropped her mask and become a genuine woman unconsciously both men felt this change and in speaking turned towards her  i cant argue it said miltoun i consider myself bound in honour  and then she asked  lord valleys with a note of real feeling interjected  by heaven i did think you put your country above your private affairs  geoff said lady valleys  but lord valleys went on  no eustace im out of touch with your view of things altogether i dont even begin to understand it  that is true said miltoun  listen to me both of you said lady valleys you two are altogether different and you must not quarrel i wont have that now eustace you are our son and you have got to be kind and considerate sit down and lets talk it over  and motioning her husband to a chair she sat down in the embrasure of a window miltoun remained standing visited by a sudden dread lady valleys said  is ityouve notthere isnt going to be a scandal  miltoun smiled grimly  i shall tell this man of course but you may make your minds easy i imagine i understand that his view of marriage does not permit of divorce in any case whatever  lady valleys sighed with an utter and undisguised relief  well then my dear boy she began even if you do feel you must tell him there is surely no reason why it should not otherwise be kept secret  lord valleys interrupted her  i should be glad if you would point out the connection between your honour and the resignation of your seat he said stiffly  miltoun shook his head  if you dont see already it would be useless  i do not see the whole matter isis unfortunate but to give up your work so long as there is no absolute necessity seems to me farfetched and absurd how many men are there into whose lives there has not entered some such relation at one time or another this idea would disqualify half the nation his eyes seemed in that crisis both to consult and to avoid his wifes as though he were at once asking her endorsement of his point of view and observing the proprieties and for a moment in the midst of her anxiety her sense of humour got the better of lady valleys it was so funny that geoff should have to give himself away she could not for the life of her help fixing him with her eyes  my dear she murmured you underestimate threequarters at the very least  but lord valleys confronted with danger was growing steadier  it passes my comprehension he said why you should want to mix up sex and politics at all  miltouns answer came very slowly as if the confession were hurting his lips  there isforgive me for using the wordsuch a thing as ones religion i dont happen to regard life as divided into public and private departments my vision is gonebrokeni can see no object before me now in public lifeno goalno certainty  lady valleys caught his hand  oh my dear she said thats too dreadfully puritanical but at miltouns queer smile she added hastily logicali mean  consult your common sense eustace for goodness sake broke in lord valleys isnt it your simple duty to put your scruples in your pocket and do the best you can for your country with the powers that have been given you  i have no common sense  in that case of course it may be just as well that you should leave public life  miltoun bowed  nonsense cried lady valleys you dont understand geoffrey i ask you again eustace what will you do afterwards  i dont know  you will eat your heart out  quite possibly  if you cant come to a reasonable arrangement with your conscience again broke in lord valleys for heavens sake give her up like a man and cut all these knots  i beg your pardon sir said miltoun icily  lady valleys laid her hand on his arm you must allow us a little logic too my dear you dont seriously imagine that she would wish you to throw away your life for her im not such a bad judge of character as that  she stopped before the expression on miltouns face  you go too fast he said i may become a free spirit yet  to this saying which seemed to her cryptic and sinister lady valleys did not know what to answer  if you feel as you say lord valleys began once more that the bottom has been knocked out of things for you by thisthis affair dont for goodness sake do anything in a hurry wait go abroad get your balance back youll find the thing settle itself in a few months dont precipitate matters you can make your health an excuse to miss the autumn session  lady valleys chimed in eagerly  you really are seeing the thing out of all proportion what is a loveaffair my dear boy do you suppose for a moment anyone would think the worse of you even if they knew and really not a soul need know  it has not occurred to me to consider what they would think  then cried lady valleys nettled its simply your own pride  you have said  lord valleys who had turned away spoke in an almost tragic voice  i did not think that on a point of honour i should differ from my son  catching at the word honour lady valleys cried suddenly  eustace promise me before you do anything to consult your uncle dennis  miltoun smiled  this becomes comic he said  at that word which indeed seemed to them quite wanton lord and lady valleys turned on their son and the three stood staring perfectly silent a little noise from the doorway interrupted them     chapter xviii  left by her father and mother to the further entertainment of harbinger barbara had said  lets have coffee in here and passed into the withdrawing room  except for that one evening when together by the sea wall they stood contemplating the populace she had not been alone with him since he kissed her under the shelter of the box hedge and now after the first moment she looked at him calmly though in her breast there was a fluttering as if an imprisoned bird were struggling ever so feebly against that soft and solid cage her last jangled talk with courtier had left an ache in her heart besides did she not know all that harbinger could give her  like a nymph pursued by a faun who held dominion over the groves she fugitive kept looking back there was nothing in that fair wood of his with which she was not familiar no thicket she had not travelled no stream she had not crossed no kiss she could not return his was a discovered land in which as of right she would reign she had nothing to hope from him but power and solid pleasure her eyes said how am i to know whether i shall not want more than you feel suffocated in your arms be surfeited by all that you will bring me have i not already got all that  she knew from his downcast gloomy face how cruel she seemed and was sorry she wanted to be good to him and said almost shyly  are you angry with me claud  harbinger looked up  what makes you so cruel  i am not cruel  you are where is your heart  here said barbara touching her breast  ah muttered harbinger im not joking  she said gently  is it as bad as that my dear  but the softness of her voice seemed to fan the smouldering fires in him  theres something behind all this he stammered youve no right to make a fool of me  and what is the something please  thats for you to say but im not blind what about this fellow courtier  at that moment there was revealed to barbara a new acquaintancethe male proper no to live with him would not be quite lacking in adventure  his face had darkened his eyes were dilated his whole figure seemed to have grown she suddenly noticed the hair which covered his clenched fists all his suavity had left him he came very close  how long that look between them lasted and of all there was in it she had no clear knowledge thought after thought wave after wave of feeling rushed through her revolt and attraction contempt and admiration queer sensations of disgust and pleasure all mingledas on a may day one may see the hail fall and the sun suddenly burn through and steam from the grass  then he said hoarsely  oh babs you madden me so  smoothing her lips as if to regain control of them she answered  yes i think i have had enough and went out into her fathers study  the sight of lord and lady valleys so intently staring at miltoun restored hex selfpossession  it struck her as slightly comic not knowing that the little scene was the outcome of that word in truth the contrast between miltoun and his parents at this moment was almost ludicrous  lady valleys was the first to speak  better comic than romantic i suppose barbara may know considering her contribution to this matter your brother is resigning his seat my dear his conscience will not permit him to retain it under certain circumstances that have arisen  oh cried barbara but surely  the matter has been argued babs lord valleys said shortly unless you have some better reason to advance than those of ordinary common sense public spirit and consideration for ones family it will hardly be worth your while to reopen the discussion  barbara looked up at miltoun whose face all but the eyes was like a mask  oh eusty she said youre not going to spoil your life like this just think how i shall feel  miltoun answered stonily  you did what you thought right as i am doing  does she want you to  no  there is i should imagine put in lord valleys not a solitary creature in the whole world except your brother himself who would wish for this consummation but with him such a consideration does not weigh  oh sighed barbara think of granny  i prefer not to think of her murmured lady valleys  shes so wrapped up in you eusty she always has believed in you intensely  miltoun sighed and encouraged by that sound barbara went closer  it was plain enough that behind his impassivity a desperate struggle was going on in miltoun he spoke at last  if i have not already yielded to one who is naturally more to me than anything when she begged and entreated it is because i feel this in a way you dont realize i apologize for using the word comic just now i should have said tragic ill enlighten uncle dennis if that will comfort you but this is not exactly a matter for anyone except myself and without another look or word he went out  as the door closed barbara ran towards it and with a motion strangely like the wringing of hands said  oh dear oh dear then turning away to a bookcase she began to cry  this ebullition of feeling surpassing even their own came as a real shock to lady and lord valleys ignorant of how strungup she had been before she entered the room they had not seen barbara cry since she was a tiny girl and in face of her emotion any animus they might have shown her for having thrown miltoun into mrs noels arms now melted away lord valleys especially moved went up to his daughter and stood with her in that dark corner saying nothing but gently stroking her hand lady valleys who herself felt very much inclined to cry went out of sight into the embrasure of the window  barbaras sobbing was soon subdued  its his face she said and why why its so unnecessary  lord valleys continually twisting his moustache muttered  exactly he makes things for himself  yes murmured lady valleys from the window he was always uncomfortable like that i remember him as a baby bertie never was  and then the silence was only broken by the little angry sounds of barbara blowing her nose  i shall go and see mother said lady valleys suddenly the boys whole life may be ruined if we cant stop this are you coming child  but barbara refused  she went to her room instead this crisis in miltouns life had strangely shaken her it was as if fate had suddenly revealed all that any step out of the beaten path might lead to had brought her sharply up against herself to wing out into the blue see what it meant if miltoun kept to his resolve and gave up public life he was lost and she herself the fascination of courtiers chivalrous manner of a sort of innate gallantry suggesting the quest of everlasting dangerwas it not rather absurd andwas she fascinated was it not simply that she liked the feeling of fascinating him through the maze of these thoughts darted the memory of harbingers face close to her own his clenched hands the swift revelation of his dangerous masculinity it was all a nightmare of scaring queer sensations of things that could never be settled she was stirred for once out of all her normal conquering philosophy her thoughts flew back to miltoun that which she had seen in their faces then had come to pass and picturing agathas horror when she came to hear of it barbara could not help a smile poor eustace why did he take things so hardly if he really carried out his resolveand he never changed his mindit would be tragic it would mean the end of everything for him  perhaps now he would get tired of mrs noel but she was not the sort of woman a man would get tired of even barbara in her inexperience felt that she would always be too delicately careful never to cloy him never to exact anything from him or let him feel that he was bound to her by so much as a hair ah why couldnt they go on as if nothing had happened could nobody persuade him she thought again of courtier if he who knew them both and was so fond of mrs noel would talk to miltoun about the right to be happy the right to revolt eustace ought to revolt it was his duty she sat down to write then putting on her hat took the note and slipped downstairs     chapter xix  the flowers of summer in the great glass house at ravensham were keeping the last afternoonwatch when clifton summoned lady casterley with the words  lady valleys in the white room  since the news of miltouns illness and of mrs noels nursing the little old lady had possessed her soul in patience often it is true afflicted with poignant misgivings as to this new influence in the life of her favourite affected too by a sort of jealousy not to be admitted even in her prayers which though regular enough were perhaps somewhat formal having small liking now for leaving home even for catton her country place she was still at ravensham where lord dennis had come up to stay with her as soon as miltoun had left sea house but lady casterley was never very dependent on company she retained unimpaired her intense interest in politics and still corresponded freely with prominent men of late too a slight revival of the june war scare had made its mark on her in a certain rejuvenescence which always accompanied her contemplation of national crises even when such were a little in the air at blast of trumpet her spirit still leaped forward unsheathed its sword and stood at the salute at such times she rose earlier went to bed later was far less susceptible to draughts and refused with asperity any food between meals she wrote too with her own hand letters which she would otherwise have dictated to her secretary unfortunately the scare had died down again almost at once and the passing of danger always left her rather irritable lady valleys visit came as a timely consolation  she kissed her daughter critically for there was that about her manner which she did not like  yes of course i am well she said why didnt you bring barbara  she was tired  hm afraid of meeting me since she committed that piece of folly over eustace you must be careful of that child gertrude or she will be doing something silly herself i dont like the way she keeps claud harbinger hanging in the wind  her daughter cut her short  there is bad news about eustace  lady casterley lost the little colour in her cheeks lost too all her superfluity of irritable energy  tell me at once  having heard she said nothing but lady valleys noticed with alarm that over her eyes had come suddenly the peculiar filminess of age  well what do you advise she asked  herself tired and troubled she was conscious of a quite unwonted feeling of discouragement before this silent little figure in the silent white room she had never before seen her mother look as if she heard defeat passing on its dark wings and moved by sudden tenderness for the little frail body that had borne her so long ago she murmured almost with surprise  mother dear  yes said lady casterley as if speaking to herself the boy saves things up he stores his feelingsthey burst and sweep him away first his passion now his conscience there are two men in him but this will be the death of one of them and suddenly turning on her daughter she said  did you ever hear about him at oxford gertrude he broke out once and ate husks with the gadarenes you never knew of courseyou never have known anything of him  resentment rose in lady valleys that anyone should knew her son better than herself but she lost it again looking at the little figure and said sighing  well  lady casterley murmured  go away child i must think you say hes to consult dennis do you know her address ask barbara when you get back and telephone it to me and at her daughters kiss she added grimly  i shall live to see him in the saddle yet though i am seventyeight  when the sound of her daughters car had died away she rang the bell  if lady valleys rings up clifton dont take the message but call me and seeing that clifton did not move she added sharply well  there is no bad news of his young lordships health i hope  no  forgive me my lady but i have had it on my mind for some time to ask you something  and the old man raised his hand with a peculiar dignity seeming to say you will excuse me that for the moment i am a human being speaking to a human being  the matter of his attachment he went on is known to me it has given me acute anxiety knowing his lordship as i do and having heard him say something singular when he was here in july i should be grateful if you would assureme that there is to be no hitch in his career my lady  the expression on lady casterleys face was strangely compounded of surprise kindliness defence and impatience as with a child  not if i can prevent it clifton she said shortly in fact you need not concern yourself  clifton bowed  excuse me mentioning it my lady a quiver ran over his face between its long white whiskers but his young lordships career is more to me than my own  when he had left her lady casterley sat down in a little low chairlong she sat there by the empty hearth till the daylight was all gone     chapter xx  not far from the darkhaloed indeterminate limbo where dwelt that bugbear of charles courtier the great halftruth authority he himself had a couple of rooms at fifteen shillings a week their chief attraction was that the great halftruth liberty had recommended them they tied him to nothing and were ever at his disposal when he was in london for his landlady though not bound by agreement so to do let them in such a way that she could turn anyone else out at a weeks notice she was a gentle soul married to a socialistic plumber twenty years her senior the worthy man had given her two little boys and the three of them kept her in such permanent order that to be in the presence of courtier was the greatest pleasure she knew when he disappeared on one of his nomadic missions explorations or adventures she enclosed the whole of his belongings in two tin trunks and placed them in a cupboard which smelled a little of mice when he reappeared the trunks were reopened and a powerful scent of dried roseleaves would escape for recognizing the mortality of things human she procured every summer from her sister the wife of a market gardener a consignment of this commodity which she passionately sewed up in bags and continued to deposit year by year in courtiers trunks  this and the way she made his toastvery crispand aired his linenvery dry were practically the only things she could do for a man naturally inclined to independence and accustomed from his manner of life to fend for himself  at first signs of his departure she would go into some closet or other away from the plumber and the two marks of his affection and cry quietly but never in courtiers presence did she dream of manifesting griefas soon weep in the presence of death or birth or any other fundamental tragedy or joy in face of the realities of life she had known from her youth up the value of the simple verb stostareto stand fast  and to her courtier was a reality the chief reality of life the focus of her aspiration the morning and the evening star  the request then five days after his farewell visit to mrs noelfor the elephanthide trunk which accompanied his rovings produced her habitual period of seclusion followed by her habitual appearance in his sittingroom bearing a note and some bags of dried roseleaves on a tray she found him in his shirt sleeves packing  well mrs benton off again  mrs benton plaiting her hands for she had not yet lost something of the look and manner of a little girl answered in her flat but serene voice  yes sir and i hope youre not going anywhere very dangerous this time i always think you go to such dangerous places  to persia mrs benton where the carpets come from  oh yes sir your washings just come home  her apparently castdown eyes stored up a wealth of little details the way his hair grew the set of his back the colour of his braces but suddenly she said in a surprising voice  you havent a photograph you could spare sir to leave behind mr benton was only saying to me yesterday weve nothing to remember him by in case he shouldnt come back  heres an old one  mrs benton took the photograph  oh she said you can see who it is and holding it perhaps too tightly for her fingers trembled she added  a note please sir and the messenger boy is waiting foran answer  while he read the note she noticed with concern how packing had brought the blood into his head  when in response to that note courtier entered the wellknown confectioners called gustards it was still not quite teatime and there seemed to him at first no one in the room save three middleaged women packing sweets then in the corner he saw barbara the blood was no longer in his head he was pale walking down that mahoganycoloured room impregnated with the scent of weddingcake barbara too was pale  so close to her that he could count her every eyelash and inhale the scent of her hair and clothes to listen to her story of miltoun so hesitatingly so wistfully told seemed very like being kept waiting with the rope already round his neck to hear about another persons toothache he felt this to have been unnecessary on the part of fate and there came to him perversely the memory of that ride over the sunwarmed heather when he had paraphrased the old sicilian song here will i sit and sing he was a long way from singing now nor was there love in his arms there was instead a cup of tea and in his nostrils the scent of cake with now and then a whiff of orangeflower water  i see he said when she had finished telling him libertys a glorious feast you want me to go to your brother and quote bums you know of course that he regards me as dangerous  yes but he respects and likes you  and i respect and like him answered courtier  one of the middleaged females passed carrying a large white cardboard box and the creaking of her stays broke the hush  you have been very sweet to me said barbara suddenly  courtiers heart stirred as if it were turning over within him and gazing into his teacup he answered  all men are decent to the evening star i will go at once and find your brother when shall i bring you news  tomorrow at five ill be at home  and repeating tomorrow at five he rose  looking back from the door he saw her face puzzled rather reproachful and went out gloomily the scent of cake and orangeflower water the creaking of the females stays the colour of mahogany still clung to his nose and ears and eyes but within him it was all dull baffled rage why had he not made the most of this unexpected chance why had he not made desperate love to her a conscientious ass and yetthe whole thing was absurd she was so young god knew he would be glad to be out of it if he stayed he was afraid that he would play the fool but the memory of her words you have been very sweet to me would not leave him nor the memory of her face so puzzled and reproachful yes if he stayed he would play the fool he would be asking her to marry a man double her age of no position but that which he had carved for himself and without a rap and he would be asking her in such a way that she might possibly have some little difficulty in refusing he would be letting himself go and she was only twentyfor all her womanoftheworld air a child no he would be useful to her if possible this once and then clear out     chapter xxi  when miltoun left valleys house he walked in the direction of westminster during the five days that he had been back in london he had not yet entered the house of commons after the seclusion of his illness he still felt a yearning almost painful towards the movement and stir of the town everything he heard and saw made an intensely vivid impression the lions in trafalgar square the great buildings of whitehall filled him with a sort of exultation he was like a man who after a long sea voyage first catches sight of land and stands straining his eyes hardly breathing taking in one by one the lost features of that face he walked on to westminster bridge and going to an embrasure in the very centre looked back towards the towers  it was said that the love of those towers passed into the blood it was said that he who had sat beneath them could never again be quite the same miltoun knew that it was truedesperately true of himself in person he had sat there but three weeks but in soul he seemed to have been sitting there hundreds of years and now he would sit there no more an almost frantic desire to free himself from this coil rose up within him to be held a prisoner by that most secret of all his instincts the instinct for authority to be unable to wield authority because to wield authority was to insult authority god it was hard he turned his back on the towers and sought distraction in the faces of the passersby  each of these he knew had his struggle to keep selfrespect or was it that they were unconscious of struggle or of selfrespect and just let things drift they looked like that most of them and all his inherent contempt for the average or common welled up as he watched them yes they looked like that ironically the sight of those from whom he had desired the comfort of compromise served instead to stimulate that part of him which refused to let him compromise they looked soft soggy without pride or will as though they knew that life was too much for them and had shamefully accepted the fact they so obviously needed to be told what they might do and which way they should go they would accept orders as they accepted their work or pleasures and the thought that he was now debarred from the right to give them orders rankled in him furiously they in their turn glanced casually at his tall figure leaning against the parapet not knowing how their fate was trembling in the balance his thin sallow face and hungry eyes gave one or two of them perhaps a feeling of interest or discomfort but to most he was assuredly no more than any other man or woman in the hurlyburly that dark figure of conscious power struggling in the fetters of its own belief in power was a piece of sculpture they had neither time nor wish to understand having no taste for tragedyfor witnessing the human spirit driven to the wall  it was five oclock before miltoun left the bridge and passed like an exile before the gates of church and state on his way to his uncles club he stopped to telegraph to audrey the time he would be coming tomorrow afternoon and on leaving the postoffice noticed in the window of the adjoining shop some reproductions of old italian masterpieces amongst them one of botticellis birth of venus he had never seen that picture and remembering that she had told him it was her favourite he stopped to look at it averagely well versed in such matters as became one of his caste miltoun had not the power of letting a work of art insidiously steal the private self from his soul and replace it with the self of all the world and he examined this farfamed presentment of the heathen goddess with aloofness even irritation the drawing of the body seemed to him crude the whole picture a little flat and early he did not like the figure of the flora the golden serenity and tenderness of which she had spoken left him cold then he found himself looking at the face and slowly but with uncanny certainty began to feel that he was looking at the face of audrey herself the hair was golden and different the eyes grey and different the mouth a little fuller yetit was her face the same oval shape the same farapart arched brows the same strangely tender elusive spirit and as though offended he turned and walked on in the window of that little shop was the effigy of her for whom he had bartered away his lifethe incarnation of passive and entwining love that gentle creature who had given herself to him so utterly for whom love and the flowers and trees and birds music the sky and the quickflowing streams were allsufficing and who like the goddess in the picture seemed wondering at her own existence he had a sudden glimpse of understanding strange indeed in one who had so little power of seeing into others hearts ought she ever to have been born into a world like this but the flash of insight yielded quickly to that sickening consciousness of his own position which never left him now whatever else he did he must get rid of that malaise but what could he do in that coming life write books what sort of books could he write only such as expressed his views of citizenship his political and social beliefs as well remain sitting and speaking beneath those towers he could never join the happy band of artists those soft and indeterminate spirits for whom barriers had no meaning contentto understand interpret and create what should he be doing in that galley the thought was inconceivable a career at the baryes he might take that up but to what end to become a judge as well continue to sit beneath those towers too late for diplomacy too late for the army besides he had not the faintest taste for military glory bury himself in the country like uncle dennis and administer one of his fathers estates it would be death go amongst the poor for a moment he thought he had found a new vocation but in what capacityto order their lives when he himself could not order his own or as a mere conduit pipe for money when he believed that charity was rotting the nation to its core at the head of every avenue stood an angel or devil with drawn sword and then there came to him another thought since he was being cast forth from church and state could he not play the fallen spirit like a manbe lucifer and destroy and instinctively he at once saw himself returning to those towers and beneath them crossing the floor joining the revolutionaries the radicals the freethinkers scourging his present party the party of authority and institutions the idea struck him as supremely comic and he laughed out loud in the street  the club which lord dennis frequented was in st jamess untouched by the tides of the waters of fashionsteadily swinging to its moorings in a quiet backwater and miltoun found his uncle in the library he was reading a volume of burtons travels and drinking tea  nobody comes here he said so in spite of that word on the door we shall talk waiter bring some more tea please  impatiently but with a sort of pity miltoun watched lord denniss urbane movements wherein old age was pathetically trying to make each little thing seem important if only to the doer nothing his greatuncle could say would outweigh the warning of his picturesque old figure to be a bystander to see it all go past you to let your sword rust in its sheath as this poor old fellow had done the notion of explaining what he had come about was particularly hateful to miltoun but since he had given his word he nerved himself with secret anger and began  i promised my mother to ask you a question uncle dennis you know of my attachment i believe  lord dennis nodded  well i have joined my life to this ladys there will be no scandal but i consider it my duty to resign my seat and leave public life alone is that right or wrong according to your view  lord dennis looked at his nephew in silence a faint flush coloured his brown cheeks he had the appearance of one travelling in mind over the past  wrong i think he said at last  why if i may ask  i have not the pleasure of knowing this lady and am therefore somewhat in the dark but it appears to me that your decision is not fair to her  that is beyond me said miltoun  lord dennis answered firmly  you have asked me a frank question expecting a frank answer i suppose  miltoun nodded  then my dear dont blame me if what i say is unpalatable  i shall not  good you say you are going to give up public life for the sake of your conscience i should have no criticism to make if it stopped there  he paused and for quite a minute remained silent evidently searching for words to express some intricate thread of thought  but it wont eustace the public man in you is far stronger than the other you want leadership more than you want love your sacrifice will kill your affection what you imagine is your loss and hurt will prove to be this ladys in the end  miltoun smiled  lord dennis continued very dryly and with a touch of malice  you are not listening to me but i can see very well that the process has begun already underneath theres a curious streak of the jesuit in you eustace what you dont want to see you wont look at  you advise me then to compromise  on the contrary i point out that you will be compromising if you try to keep both your conscience and your love you will be seeking to have it both ways  that is interesting  and you will find yourself having it neither said lord dennis sharply  miltoun rose in other words you like the others recommend me to desert this lady who loves me and whom i love and yet uncle they say that in your own case  but lord dennis had risen too having lost all the appanage and manner of old age  of my own case he said bluntly we wont talk i dont advise you to desert anyone you quite mistake me i advise you to know yourself and i tell you my opinion of youyou were cut out by nature for a statesman not a lover theres something driedup in you eustace im not sure there isnt something driedup in all our caste weve had to do with forms and ceremonies too long were not good at taking the lyrical point of view  unfortunately said miltoun i cannot to fit in with a theory of yours commit a baseness  lord dennis began pacing up and down he was keeping his lips closed very tight  a man who gives advice he said at last is always something of a fool for all that you have mistaken mine i am not so presumptuous as to attempt to enter the inner chamber of your spirit i have merely told you that in my opinion it would be more honest to yourself and fairer to this lady to compound with your conscience and keep both your love and your public life than to pretend that you were capable of sacrificing what i know is the stronger element in you for the sake of the weaker you remember the saying democritus i think each mans nature or character is his fate or god i recommend it to you  for a full minute miltoun stood without replying then said  i am sorry to have troubled you uncle dennis a middle policy is no use to me goodbye and without shaking hands he went out     chapter xxii  in the hall someone rose from a sofa and came towards him it was courtier  run you to earth at last he said i wish youd come and dine with me im leaving england tomorrow night and there are things i want to say  there passed through miltouns mind the rapid thought does he know he assented however and they went out together  its difficult to find a quiet place said courtier but this might do  the place chosen was a little hostel frequented by racing men and famed for the excellence of its steaks and as they sat down opposite each other in the almost empty room miltoun thought yes he does know can i stand any more of this he waited almost savagely for the attack he felt was coming  so you are going to give up your seat said courtier  miltoun looked at him for some seconds before replying  from what towncrier did you hear that  but there was that in courtiers face which checked his anger its friendliness was transparent  i am about her only friend courtier proceeded earnestly and this is my last chanceto say nothing of my feeling towards you which believe me is very cordial  go on then miltoun muttered  forgive me for putting it bluntly have you considered what her position was before she met you  miltoun felt the blood rushing to his face but he sat still clenching his nails into the palms of his hands  yes yes said courtier but that attitude of mindyou used to have it yourselfwhich decrees either living death or spiritual adultery to women makes my blood boil you cant deny that those were the alternatives and i say you had the right fundamentally to protest against them not only in words but deeds you did protest i know but this present decision of yours is a climb down as much as to say that your protest was wrong  miltoun rose from his seat i cannot discuss this he said i cannot  for her sake you must if you give up your public work youll spoil her life a second time  miltoun again sat down at the word must a steely feeling had come to his aid his eyes began to resemble the old cardinals your nature and mine courtier he said are too far apart we shall never understand each other  never mind that answered courtier admitting those two alternatives to be horrible which you never would have done unless the facts had been brought home to you personally  that said miltoun icily i deny your right to say  anyway you do admit themif you believe you had not the right to rescue her on what principle do you base that belief  miltoun placed his elbow on the table and leaning his chin on his hand regarded the champion of lost causes without speaking there was such a turmoil going on within him that with difficulty he could force his lips to obey him  by what right do you ask me that he said at last he saw courtiers face grow scarlet and his fingers twisting furiously at those flamelike moustaches but his answer was as steadily ironical as usual  well i can hardly sit still my last evening in england without lifting a finger while you immolate a woman to whom i feel like a brother ill tell you what your principle is authority unjust or just desirable or undesirable must be implicitly obeyed to break a law no matter on what provocation or for whose sake is to break the commandment  dont hesitatesay of god  of an infallible fixed power is that a true definition of your principle  yes said miltoun between his teeth i think so  exceptions prove the rule  hard cases make bad law  courtier smiled i knew you were coming out with that i deny that they do with this law which is altogether behind the times you had the right to rescue this woman  no courtier if we must fight let us fight on the naked facts i have not rescued anyone i have merely stolen sooner than starve that is why i cannot go on pretending to be a pattern if it were known i could not retain my seat an hour i cant take advantage of an accidental secrecy could you  courtier was silent and with his eyes miltoun pressed on him as though he would despatch him with that glance  i could said courtier at last when this law by enforcing spiritual adultery on those who have come to hate their mates destroys the sanctity of the married statethe very sanctity it professes to uphold you must expect to have it broken by reasoning men and women without their feeling shame or losing selfrespect  in miltoun there was rising that vast and subtle passion for dialectic combat which was of his very fibre he had almost lost the feeling that this was his own future being discussed he saw before him in this sanguine man whose voice and eyes had such a whitehot sound and look the incarnation of all that he temperamentally opposed  that he said is devils advocacy i admit no individual as judge in his own case  ah now were coming to it by the way shall we get out of this heat  they were no sooner in the cooler street than the voice of courtier began again  distrust of human nature fearits the whole basis of action for men of your stamp you deny the right of the individual to judge because youve no faith in the essential goodness of men at heart you believe them bad you give them no freedom you allow them no consent because you believe that their decisions would move downwards and not upwards well its the whole difference between the aristocratic and the democratic view of life as you once told me you hate and fear the crowd  miltoun eyed that steady sanguine face askance  yes he said i do believe that men are raised in spite of themselves  youre honest by whom  again miltoun felt rising within him a sort of fury once for all he would slay this redhaired rebel he answered with almost savage irony  strangely enough by that being to mention whom you objectworking through the medium of the best  highpriest look at that girl slinking along there with her eye on us suppose instead of withdrawing your garment you went over and talked to her got her to tell you what she really felt and thought youd find things that would astonish you at bottom mankind is splendid and theyre raised sir by the aspiration thats in all of them havent you ever noticed that public sentiment is always in advance of the law  and you said miltoun are the man who is never on the side of the majority  the champion of lost causes uttered a short laugh  not so logical as all that he answered the wind still blows and lifes not a set of rules hung up in an office lets see where are we they had been brought to a standstill by a group on the pavement in front of the queens hall shall we go in and hear some music and cool our tongues  miltoun nodded and they went in  the great lighted hall filled with the faint bluefish vapour from hundreds of little rolls of tobacco leaf was crowded from floor to ceiling  taking his stand among the strawhatted throng miltoun heard that steady ironical voice behind him  profanum vulgus come to listen to the finest piece of music ever written folk whom you wouldnt trust a yard to know what was good for them deplorable sight isnt it  he made no answer the first slow notes of the seventh symphony of beethoven had begun to steal forth across the bank of flowers and save for the steady rising of that bluefish vapour as it were incense burnt to the god of melody the crowd had become deathly still as though one mind one spirit possessed each pale face inclined towards that music rising and falling like the sighing of the winds that welcome from death the freed spirits of the beautiful  when the last notes had died away he turned and walked out  well said the voice behind him hasnt that shown you how things swell and grow how splendid the world is  miltoun smiled  it has shown me how beautiful the world can be made by a great man  and suddenly as if the music had loosened some band within him he began to pour forth words  look at the crowd in this street courtier which of all crowds in the whole world can best afford to be left to itself secure from pestilence earthquake cyclone drought from extremes of heat and cold in the heart of the greatest and safest city in the world and yetsee the figure of that policeman running through all the good behaviour of this crowd however safe and free it looks there is there always must be a central force holding it together where does that central force come from from the crowd itself you say i answer no look back at the origin of human states from the beginnings of things the best man has been the unconscious medium of authority of the controlling principle of the divine force he felt that power within himphysical at firsthe used it to take the lead he has held the lead ever since he must always hold it all your processes of election your socalled democratic apparatus are only a blind to the inquiring a sop to the hungry a salve to the pride of the rebellious they are merely surface machinery they cannot prevent the best man from coming to the top for the best man stands nearest to the deity and is the first to receive the waves that come from him im not speaking of heredity the best man is not necessarily born in my class and i at all events do not believe he is any more frequent there than in other classes  he stopped as suddenly as he had begun  you neednt be afraid answered courtier that i take you for an average specimen youre at one end and i at the other and we probably both miss the golden mark but the world is not ruled by power and the fear which power produces as you think its ruled by love society is held together by the natural decency in man by fellowfeeling the democratic principle which you despise at root means nothing at all but that man left to himself is on the upward lay if it werent so do you imagine for a moment your boys in blue could keep order a man knows unconsciously what he can and what he cant do without losing his selfrespect he sucks that knowledge in with every breath laws and authority are not the beall and endall they are conveniences machinery conduit pipes main roads theyre not of the structure of the buildingtheyre only scaffolding  miltoun lunged out with the retort  without which no building could be built  courtier parried  thats rather different my friend from identifying them with the building they are things to be taken down as fast as ever they can be cleared away to make room for an edifice that begins on earth not in the sky all the scaffolding of law is merely there to save time to prevent the temple as it mounts from losing its way and straying out of form  no said miltoun no the scaffolding as you call it is the material projection of the architects conception without which the temple does not and cannot rise and the architect is god working through the minds and spirits most akin to himself  we are now at the bedrock cried courtier your god is outside this world mine within it  and never the twain shall meet  in the silence that followed miltoun saw that they were in leicester square all quiet as yet before the theatres had disgorged quiet yet waiting with the lights like yellow stars lowdriven from the dark heavens clinging to the white shapes of musichalls and cafes and a sort of flying glamour blanching the still foliage of the plane trees  a whitely wantonthis square said courtier alive as a face no end to its queer beauty and by jove if you went deep enough youd find goodness even here  and youd ignore the vice miltoun answered  he felt weary all of a sudden anxious to get to his rooms unwilling to continue this battle of words that brought him no nearer to relief it was with strange lassitude that he heard the voice still speaking  we must make a night of it since tomorrow we die you would curb licence from withouti from within when i get up and when i go to bed when i draw a breath see a face or a flower or a treeif i didnt feel that i was looking on the deity i believe i should quit this palace of varieties from sheer boredom you i understand cant look on your god unless you withdraw into some high place isnt it a bit lonely there  there are worse things than loneliness and they walked on in silence till suddenly miltoun broke out  you talk of tyranny what tyranny could equal this tyranny of your freedom what tyranny in the world like that of this free vulgar narrow street with its hundred journals teeming like ants nests to producewhat in the entrails of that creature of your freedom courtier there is room neither for exaltation discipline nor sacrifice there is room only for commerce and licence  there was no answer for a moment and from those tall houses whose lighted windows he had apostrophized miltoun turned away towards the river no said the voice beside him for all its faults the wind blows in that street and theres a chance for everything by god i would rather see a few stars struggle out in a black sky than any of your perfect artificial lighting  and suddenly it seemed to miltoun that he could never free himself from the echoes of that voiceit was not worth while to try we are repeating ourselves he said dryly  the rivers black water was making stilly slow recessional under a halfmoon beneath the cloak of night the chaos on the far bank the forms of cranes high buildings jetties the bodies of the sleeping barges amillion queer dark shapes were invested with emotion all was religious out there all beautiful all strange and over this great quiet friend of man lampsthose humble flowers of night were throwing down the faint continual glamour of fallen petals and a sweetscented wind stole along from the west very slow as yet bringing in advance the tremor and perfume of the innumerable trees and fields which the river had loved as she came by  a murmur that was no true sound but like the whisper of a heart to a heart accompanied this voyage of the dark water  then a small blunt skiffmanned by two rowers came by under the wall with the thudding and the creak of oars  so tomorrow we die said miltoun you mean i suppose that public life is the breath of my nostrils and i must die because i give it up  courtier nodded  am i right in thinking that it was my young sister who sent you on this crusade  courtier did not answer  and so miltoun went on looking him through and through tomorrow is to be your last day too well youre right to go she is not an ugly duckling who can live out of the social pond shell always want her native element and now well say goodbye whatever happens to us both i shall remember this evening smiling he put out his hand moriturus te saluto     chapter xxiii  courtier sat in hyde park waiting for five oclock the day had recovered somewhat from a grey morning as though the glow of that long hot summer were too burntin on the air to yield to the first assault the sun piercing the crisped clouds those breast feathers of heavenly doves darted its beams at the mellowed leaves and showered to the ground their delicate shadow stains the first too early scent from leaves about to fall penetrated to the heart and sorrowful sweet birds were tuning their little autumn pipes blowing into them fragments of spring odes to liberty  courtier thought of miltoun and his mistress by what a strange fate had those two been thrown together to what end was their love coming the seeds of grief were already sown what flowers of darkness or of tumult would come up he saw her again as a little grave considering child with her soft eyes set wide apart under the dark arched brows and the little tuck at the corner of her mouth that used to come when he teased her and to that gentle creature who would sooner die than force anyone to anything had been given this queer lover this aristocrat by birth and nature with the dried fervent soul whose every fibre had been bred and trained in and to the service of authority this rejecter of the unity of life this worshipper of an old god a god that stood whip in hand driving men to obedience a god that even now courtier could conjure up staring at him from the walls of his nursery the god his own father had believed in a god of the old testament knowing neither sympathy nor understanding strange that he should be alive still that there should still be thousands who worshipped him yet not so very strange if as they said man made god in his own image here indeed was a curious mating of what the philosophers would call the will to love and the will to power  a soldier and his girl came and sat down on a bench close by they looked askance at this trim and upright figure with the fighting face then some subtle thing informing them that he was not of the disturbing breed called officer they ceased to regard him abandoning themselves to dumb and inexpressive felicity arm in arm touching each other they seemed to courtier very jolly having that look of living entirely in the moment which always especially appealed to one whose blood ran too fast to allow him to speculate much upon the future or brood much over the past  a leaf from the bough above him loosened by the suns kisses dropped and fell yellow at his feet the leaves were turning very soon  it was characteristic of this man who could be so hot over the lost causes of others that sitting there within half an hour of the final loss of his own cause he could be so calm so almost apathetic this apathy was partly due to the hopelessness which nature had long perceived of trying to make him feel oppressed but also to the habits of a man incurably accustomed to carrying his fortunes in his hand and that hand open it did not seem real to him that he was actually going to suffer a defeat to have to confess that he had hankered after this girl all these past weeks and that tomorrow all would be wasted and she as dead to him as if he had never seen her no it was not exactly resignation it was rather sheer lack of commercial instinct if only this had been the lost cause of another person how gallantly he would have rushed to the assault and taken her by storm if only he himself could have been that other person how easily how passionately could he not have pleaded letting forth from him all those words which had knocked at his teeth ever since he knew her and which would have seemed so ridiculous and so unworthy spoken on his own behalf yes for that other person he could have cut her out from under the guns of the enemy he could have taken her that fairest prize and in queer cheerylooking apathynot far removed perhaps from despairhe sat watching the leaves turn over and fall and now and then cutting with his stick at the air where autumn was already riding and if in imagination he saw himself carrying her away into the wilderness and with his devotion making her happiness to grow it was so far a flight that a smile crept about his lips and once or twice he snapped his jaws  the soldier and his girl rose passing in front of him down the row he watched their scarlet and blue figures moving slowly towards the sun and another couple close to the rails crossing those receding forms very straight and tall there was something exhilarating in the way this new couple swung along holding their heads up turning towards each other to exchange words or smiles even at that distance they could be seen to be of high fashion in their gait was the almost insolent poise of those who are above doubts and cares certain of the world and of themselves the girls dress was tawny brown her hair and hat too of the same hue and the pursuing sunlight endowed her with a hazy splendour then courtier saw who they werethat couple  except for an unconscious grinding of his teeth he made no sound or movement so that they went by without seeing him her voice though not the words came to him distinctly he saw her hand slip up under harbingers arm and swiftly down again a smile of whose existence he was unaware settled on his lips he got up shook himself as a dog shakes off a beating and walked away with his mouth set very firm     chapter xxiv  left alone among the little mahogany tables of gustards where the scent of cake and of orangeflower water made happy all the air barbara had sat for some minutes her eyes cast downas a child from whom a toy has been taken contemplates the ground not knowing precisely what she is feeling then paying one of the middleaged females she went out into the square there a german band was playing delibes coppelia and the murdered tune came haunting her a very ghost of incongruity  she went straight back to valleys house in the room where three hours ago she had been left alone after lunch with harbinger her sister was seated in the window looking decidedly upset in fact agatha had just spent an awkward hour chancing with little ann into that confectioners where she could best obtain a particularly gummy sweet which she believed wholesome for her children she had been engaged in purchasing a pound when looking down she perceived ann standing stockstill with her sudden little nose pointed down the shop and her mouth opening glancing in the direction of those frank enquiring eyes agatha saw to her amazement her sister and a man whom she recognized as courtier with a readiness which did her complete credit she placed a sweet in anns mouth and saying to the middleaged female then youll send those please come ann went out shocks never coming singly she had no sooner reached home than from her father she learned of the development of miltouns love affair when barbara returned she was sitting unfeignedly disturbed and grieved unable to decide whether or no she ought to divulge what she herself had seen but withal buoyedup by that peculiar indignation of the essentially domestic woman whose ideals have been outraged  judging at once from the expression of her face that she must have heard the news of miltoun barbara said  well my dear angel any lecture for me  agatha answered coldly  i think you were quite mad to take mrs noel to him  the whole duty of woman murmured barbara includes a little madness  agatha looked at her in silence  i cant make you out she said at last youre not a fool  only a knave  you may think it right to joke over the ruin of miltouns life murmured agatha i dont  barbaras eyes grew bright and in a hard voice she answered  the world is not your nursery angel  agatha closed her lips very tightly as who should imply then it ought to be but she only answered  i dont think you know that i saw you just now in gustards  barbara eyed her for a moment in amazement and began to laugh  i see she said monstrous depravitypoor old gustards and still laughing that dangerous laugh she turned on her heel and went out  at dinner and afterwards that evening she was very silent having on her face the same look that she wore out hunting especially when in difficulties of any kind or if advised to take a pull when she got away to her own room she had a longing to relieve herself by some kind of action that would hurt someone if only herself to go to bed and toss about in a feverfor she knew herself in these thwarted moodswas of no use for a moment she thought of going out that would be fun and hurt them too but it was difficult she did not want to be seen and have the humiliation of an open row then there came into her head the memory of the roof of the tower where she had once been as a little girl she would be in the air there she would be able to breathe to get rid of this feverishness with the unhappy pleasure of a spoiled child taking its revenge she took care to leave her bedroom door open so that her maid would wonder where she was and perhaps be anxious and make them anxious slipping through the moonlit picture gallery on to the landing outside her fathers sanctum whence rose the stone staircase leading to the roof she began to mount she was breathless when after that unending flight of stairs she emerged on to the roof at the extreme northern end of the big house where below her was a sheer drop of a hundred feet at first she stood a little giddy grasping the rail that ran round that garden of lead still absorbed in her brooding rebellious thoughts gradually she lost consciousness of everything save the scene before her high above all neighbouring houses she was almost appalled by the majesty of what she saw this nightclothed city so remote and dark so whitegleaming and alive on whose purple hills and valleys grew such myriad golden flowers of light from whose heart came this deep incessant murmurcould it possibly be the same city through which she had been walking that very day from its sleeping body the supreme wistful spirit had emerged in dark loveliness and was lowflying down there tempting her barbara turned round to take in all that amazing prospect from the black glades of hyde park in front to the powdery white ghost of a church tower away to the east how marvellous was this city of night and as in presence of that wide darkness of the sea before dawn her spirit had felt little and timid within herso it felt now in face of this great brooding beautiful creature whom man had made she singled out the shapes of the piccadilly hotels and beyond them the palaces and towers of westminster and whitehall and everywhere the inextricable loveliness of dim blue forms and sinuous pallid lines of light under an indigodark sky near at hand she could see plainly the stilllighted windows the motorcars gliding by far down even the tiny shapes of people walking and the thought that each of them meant someone like herself seemed strange  drinking of this wondercup she began to experience a queer intoxication and lost the sense of being little rather she had the feeling of power as in her dream at monkland she too as well as this great thing below her seemed to have shed her body to be emancipated from every barrierfloating deliciously identified with air she seemed to be one with the enfranchised spirit of the city drowned in perception of its beauty then all that feeling went and left her frowning shivering though the wind from the west was warm her whole adventure of coming up here seemed bizarre ridiculous very stealthily she crept down and had reached once more the door into the picture gallery when she heard her mothers voice say in amazement that you babs and turning saw her coming from the doorway of the sanctum  of a sudden very cool with all her faculties about her barbara smiled and stood looking at lady valleys who said with hesitation  come in here dear a minute will you  in that room resorted to for comfort lord valleys was standing with his back to the hearth and an expression on his face that wavered between vexation and decision the doubt in agathas mind whether she should tell or no had been terribly resolved by little ann who in a pause of conversation had announced we saw auntie babs and mr courtier in gustards but we didnt speak to them  upset by the events of the afternoon lady valleys had not shown her usual savoir faire she had told her husband a meeting of this sort in a shop celebrated for little save its wedding cakes was in a sense of no importance but being disturbed already by the news of miltoun it seemed to them both nothing less than sinister as though the heavens were in league for the demolition of their house to lord valleys it was peculiarly mortifying because of his real admiration for his daughter and because he had paid so little attention to his wifes warning of some weeks back in consultation however they had only succeeded in deciding that lady valleys should talk with her though without much spiritual insight they had each of them a certain cool judgment and were fully alive to the danger of thwarting barbara this had not prevented lord valleys from expressing himself strongly on the confounded unscrupulousness of that fellow and secretly forming his own plan for dealing with this matter lady valleys more deeply conversant with her daughters nature and by reason of femininity more lenient towards the other sex had not tried to excuse courtier but had thought privately babs is rather a flirt for she could not altogether help remembering herself at the same age  summoned thus unexpectedly barbara her lips very firmly pressed together took her stand coolly enough by her fathers writingtable  seeing her suddenly appear lord valleys instinctively relaxed his frown his experience of men and things his thousands of diplomatic hours served to give him an air of coolness and detachment which he was very far from feeling in truth he would rather have faced a hostile mob than his favourite daughter in such circumstances his tanned face with its crisp grey moustache his whole head indeed took on unconsciously a more than ordinarily soldierlike appearance his eyelids drooped a little his brows rose slightly  she was wearing a blue wrap over her evening frock and he seized instinctively on that indifferent trifle to begin this talk  ah babs have you been out  alive to her very fingernails with every nerve tingling but showing no sign barbara answered  no on the roof of the tower  it gave her a real malicious pleasure to feel the perplexity beneath her fathers dignified exterior and detecting that covert mockery lord valleys said dryly  stargazing  then with that sudden resolution peculiar to him as though he were bored with having to delay and temporize he added  do you know i doubt whether its wise to make appointments in confectioners shops when ann is in london  the dangerous little gleam in barbaras eyes escaped his vision but not that of lady valleys who said at once  no doubt you had the best of reasons my dear  barbara curled her lip had it not been for the scene they had been through that day with miltoun and for their very real anxiety both would have seen then that while their daughter was in this mood least said was soonest mended but their nerves were not quite within control and with more than a touch of impatience lord valleys ejaculated  it doesnt appear to you i suppose to require any explanation  barbara answered  no  ah said lord valleys i see an explanation can be had no doubt from the gentleman whose sense of proportion was such as to cause him to suggest such a thing  he did not suggest it i did  lord valleys eyebrows rose still higher  indeed he said  geoffrey murmured lady valleys i thought i was to talk to babs  it would no doubt be wiser  in barbara thus for the first time in her life seriously reprimanded there was at work the most peculiar sensation she had ever felt as if something were scraping her very skina sick and at the same time devilish feeling at that moment she could have struck her father dead but she showed nothing having lowered the lids of her eyes  anything else she said  lord valleys jaw had become suddenly more prominent  as a sequel to your share in miltouns business it is peculiarly entrancing  my dear broke in lady valleys very suddenly babs will tell me its nothing of course  barbaras calm voice said again  anything else  the repetition of this phrase in that maddening cool voice almost broke down her fathers sorely tried control  nothing from you he said with deadly coldness i shall have the honour of telling this gentleman what i think of him  at those words barbara drew herself together and turned her eyes from one face to the other  under that gaze which for all its cool hardness was so furiously alive neither lord nor lady valleys could keep quite still it was as if she had stripped from them the wellbred mask of those whose spirits by long unquestioning acceptance of themselves have become inelastic inexpansive commoner than they knew in fact a rather awful moment then barbara said  if theres nothing else im going to bed goodnight  and as calmly as she had come in she went out  when she had regained her room she locked the door threw off her cloak and looked at herself in the glass with pleasure she saw how firmly her teeth were clenched how her breast was heaving and how her eyes seemed to be stabbing herself and all the time she thought  very well my dears very well     chapter xxv  in that mood of rebellious mortification she fell asleep and curiously enough dreamed not of him whom she had in mind been so furiously defending but of harbinger she fancied herself in prison lying in a cell fashioned like the drawingroom at sea house and in the next cell into which she could somehow look harbinger was digging at the wall with his nails she could distinctly see the hair on the back of his hands and hear him breathing the hole he was making grew larger and larger her heart began to beat furiously she awoke  she rose with a new and malicious resolution to show no sign of rebellion to go through the day as if nothing had happened to deceive them all and then exactly what and then meant she did not explain even to herself  in accordance with this plan of action she presented an untroubled front at breakfast went out riding with little ann and shopping with her mother afterwards owing to this news of miltoun the journey to scotland had been postponed she parried with cool ingenuity each attempt made by lady valleys to draw her into conversation on the subject of that meeting at gustards nor would she talk of her brother in every other way she was her usual self in the afternoon she even volunteered to accompany her mother to old lady harbingers in the neighbourhood of princes gate she knew that harbinger would be there and with the thought of meeting that other at five oclock had a cynical pleasure in thus encountering him it was so complete a blind to them all then feeling that she was accomplishing a masterstroke she even told him in her mothers hearing that she would walk home and he might come if he cared he did care  but when once she had begun to swing along in the mellow afternoon under the mellow trees where the air was sweetened by the southwest wind all that mutinous reckless mood of hers vanished she felt suddenly happy and kind glad to be walking with him today too he was cheerful as if determined not to spoil her gaiety and she was grateful for this once or twice she even put her hand up and touched his sleeve calling his attention to birds or trees friendly and glad after all those hours of bitter feelings to be giving happiness when they parted at the door of valleys house she looked back at him with a queer halfrueful smile for now the hour had come  in a little unfrequented anteroom all white panels and polish she sat down to wait the entrance drive was visible from here and she meant to encounter courtier casually in the hall she was excited and a little scornful of her own excitement she had expected him to be punctual but it was already past five and soon she began to feel uneasy almost ridiculous sitting in this room where no one ever came going to the window she looked out  a sudden voice behind her said  auntie babs  turning she saw little ann regarding her with those wide frank hazel eyes a shiver of nerves passed through barbara  is this your room its a nice room isnt it  she answered  quite a nice room ann  yes ive never been in here before theres somebody just come so i must go now  barbara involuntarily put her hands up to her cheeks and quickly passed with her niece into the hall at the very door the footman william handed her a note she looked at the superscription it was from courtier she went back into the room through its halfclosed door the figure of little ann could be seen with her legs rather wide apart and her hands clasped on her lowdown belt pointing up at william her sudden little nose barbara shut the door abruptly broke the seal and read   dear lady barbara  i am sorry to say my interview with your brother was fruitless  i happened to be sitting in the park just now and i want to wish you every happiness before i go it has been the greatest pleasure to know you i shall never have a thought of you that will not be my pride nor a memory that will not help me to believe that life is good if i am tempted to feel that things are dark i shall remember that you are breathing this same mortal air and to beauty and joy i shall take off my hat with the greater reverence that once i was permitted to walk and talk with you and so goodbye and god bless you  your faithful servant  charles courtier   her cheeks burned quick sighs escaped her lips she read the letter again but before getting to the end could not see the words for mist if in that letter there had been a word of complaint or even of regret she could not let him go like this without goodbye without any explanation at all he should not think of her as a cold stony flirt who had been merely stealing a few weeks amusement out of him she would explain to him at all events that it had not been that she would make him understand that it was not what he thoughtthat something in her wantedwanted her mind was all confused what was it she thought what did i do and sore with anger at herself she screwed the letter up in her glove and ran out she walked swiftly down to piccadilly and crossed into the green park there she passed lord malvezin and a friend strolling up towards hyde park corner and gave them a very faint bow the composure of those two precise and wellgroomed figures sickened her just then she wanted to run to fly to this meeting that should remove from him the odious feelings he must have that she barbara caradoc was a vulgar enchantress a common traitress and coquette and his letterwithout a syllable of reproach her cheeks burned so that she could not help trying to hide them from people who passed  as she drew nearer to his rooms she walked slower forcing herself to think what she should do what she should let him do but she continued resolutely forward she would not shrink nowwhatever came of it her heart fluttered seemed to stop beating fluttered again she set her teeth a sort of desperate hilarity rose in her it was an adventure then she was gripped by the feeling that had come to her on the roof the whole thing was bizarre ridiculous she stopped and drew the letter from her glove it might be ridiculous but it was due from her and closing her lips very tight she walked on in thought she was already standing close to him her eyes shut waiting with her heart beating wildly to know what she would feel when his lips had spoken perhaps touched her face or hand and she had a sort of mirage vision of herself with eyelashes resting on her cheeks lips a little parted arms helpless at her sides yet incomprehensibly his figure was invisible she discovered then that she was standing before his door  she rang the bell calmly but instead of dropping her hand pressed the little bare patch of palm left open by the glove to her face to see whether it was indeed her own cheek flaming so  the door had been opened by some unseen agency disclosing a passage and flight of stairs covered by a red carpet at the foot of which lay an old tangled brownwhite dog full of fleas and sorrow unreasoning terror seized on barbara her body remained rigid but her spirit began flying back across the green park to the very hall of valleys house then she saw coming towards her a youngish woman in a blue apron with mild reddened eyes  is this where mr courtier lives  yes miss the teeth of the young woman were few in number and rather black and barbara could only stand there saying nothing as if her body had been deserted between the sunlight and this dim red passage which led towhat  the woman spoke again  im sorry if you was wanting him miss hes just gone away  barbara felt a movement in her heart like the twang and quiver of an elastic band suddenly relaxed she bent to stroke the head of the old dog who was smelling her shoes the woman said  and of course i cant give you his address because hes gone to foreign parts  with a murmur of whose sense she knew nothing barbara hurried out into the sunshine was she glad was she sorry at the corner of the street she turned and looked back the two heads of the woman and the dog were there still poked out through the doorway  a horrible inclination to laugh seized her followed by as horrible a desire to cry     chapter xxvi  by the river the west wind whose murmuring had visited courtier and miltoun the night before was bringing up the first sky of autumn slowcreeping and fleecy grey the clouds seemed trying to overpower a sun that shone but fitfully even thus early in the day while audrey noel was dressing sunbeams danced desperately on the white wall like little lost souls with no tomorrow or gnats that wheel and wheel in brief joy leaving no footmarks on the air through the chinks of a side window covered by a dark blind some smoky filaments of light were tethered to the back of her mirror compounded of trembling grey spirals so thick to the eye that her hand felt astonishment when it failed to grasp them and so jealous as ghosts of the space they occupied they brought a moments distraction to a heart not happy for how could she be happy her lover away from her now thirty hours without having overcome with his last kisses the feeling of disaster which had settled on her when he told her of his resolve her eyes had seen deeper than his her instinct had received a message from fate  to be the draggerdown the destroyer of his usefulness to be not the helpmate but the clog not the inspiring sky but the cloud and because of a scruple which she could not understand she had no anger with that unintelligible scruple but her fatalism and her sympathy had followed it out into his future things being so it could not be long before he felt that her love was maiming him even if he went on desiring her it would be only with his body and if for this scruple he were capable of giving up his public life he would be capable of living on with her after his love was dead this thought she could not bear it stung to the very marrow of her nerves and yet surely life could not be so cruel as to have given her such happiness meaning to take it from her surely her love was not to be only one summers day his love but an embrace and thenfor ever nothing  this morning fortified by despair she admitted her own beauty he would he must want her more than that other life at the very thought of which her face darkened that other life so hard and far from her so loveless formal and yetto him so real so desperately accursedly real if he must indeed give up his career then surely the life they could live together would make up to hima life among simple and sweet things all over the world with music and pictures and the flowers and all nature and friends who sought them for themselves and in being kind to everyone and helping the poor and the unfortunate and loving each other but he did not want that sort of life what was the good of pretending that he did it was right and natural he should want to use his powers to lead and serve she would not have him otherwise with these thoughts hovering and darting within her she went on twisting and coiling her dark hair and burying her heart beneath its lace defences she noted too with her usual care two fading blossoms in the bowl of flowers on her dressingtable and removing them emptied out the water and refilled the bowl  before she left her bedroom the sunbeams had already ceased to dance the grey filaments of light were gone autumn sky had come into its own passing the mirror in the hall which was always rough with her she had not courage to glance at it then suddenly a womans belief in the power of her charm came to her aid she felt almost happysurely he must love her better than his conscience but that confidence was very tremulous ready to yield to the first rebuff even the friendly freshcheeked maid seemed that morning to be regarding her with compassion and all the innate sense not of good form but of form which made her shrink from anything that should disturb or hurt another or make anyone think she was to be pitied rose up at once within her she became more than ever careful to show nothing even to herself so she passed the morning mechanically doing the little usual things an overpowering longing was with her all the time to get him away with her from england and see whether the thousand beauties she could show him would not fire him with love of the things she loved as a girl she had spent nearly three years abroad and eustace had never been to italy nor to her beloved mountain valleys then the remembrance of his rooms at the temple broke in on that vision and shattered it no titians feast of gentian tawny brown and alpenrose could intoxicate the lover of those books those papers that great map and the scent of leather came to her now as poignantly as if she were once more flitting about noiselessly on her business of nursing then there rushed through her again the warm wonderful sense that had been with her all those precious daysof love that knew secretly of its approaching triumph and fulfilment the delicious sense of giving every minute of her time every thought and movement and all the sweet unconscious waiting for the divine irrevocable moment when at last she would give herself and be his the remembrance too of how tired how sacredly tired she had been and of how she had smiled all the time with her inner joy of being tired for him  the sound of the bell startled her his telegram had said the afternoon she determined to show nothing of the trouble darkening the whole world for her and drew a deep breath waiting for his kiss  it was not miltoun but lady casterley  the shock sent the blood buzzing into her temples then she noticed that the little figure before her was also trembling drawing up a chair she said wont you sit down  the tone of that old voice thanking her brought back sharply the memory of her garden at monkland bathed in the sweetness and shimmer of summer and of barbara standing at her gate towering above this little figure which now sat there so silent with very white face those carved features those keen yet veiled eyes had too often haunted her thoughts they were like a bad dream come true  my grandson is not here is he  audrey shook her head  we have heard of his decision i will not beat about the bush with you it is a disaster for me a calamity i have known and loved him since he was born and i have been foolish enough to dream dreams about him i wondered perhaps whether you knew how much we counted on him you must forgive an old womans coming here like this at my age there are few things that matter but they matter very much  and audrey thought and at my age there is but one thing that matters and that matters worse than death but she did not speak to whom to what should she speak to this hard old woman who personified the world of what use words  i can say to you went on the voice of the little figure that seemed so to fill the room with its grey presence what i could not bring myself to say to others for you are not hardhearted  a quiver passed up from the heart so praised to the still lips no she was not hardhearted she could even feel for this old woman from whose voice anxiety had stolen its despotism  eustace cannot live without his career his career is himself he must be doing and leading and spending his powers what he has given you is not his true self i dont want to hurt you but the truth is the truth and we must all bow before it i may be hard but i can respect sorrow  to respect sorrow yes this grey visitor could do that as the wind passing over the sea respects its surface as the air respects the surface of a rose but to penetrate to the heart to understand her sorrow that old age could not do for youth as well try to track out the secret of the twistings in the flight of those swallows out there above the river or to follow to its source the faint scent of the lilies in that bowl how should she know what was passing in herethis little old woman whose blood was cold and audrey had the sensation of watching someone pelt her with the rind and husks of what her own spirit had long devoured she had a longing to get up and take the hand the chill spidery hand of age and thrust it into her breast and say feel that and cease  but withal she never lost her queer dull compassion for the owner of that white carved face it was not her visitors fault that she had come again lady casterley was speaking  it is early days if you do not end it now at once it will only come harder on you presently you know how determined he is he will not change his mind if you cut him off from his work in life it will but recoil on you i can only expect your hatred for talking like this but believe me its for your good as well as his in the long run  a tumultuous heartbeating of ironical rage seized on the listener to that speech her good the good of a corse that the breath is just abandoning the good of a flower beneath a heel the good of an old dog whose master leaves it for the last time slowly a weight like lead stopped all that fluttering of her heart if she did not end it at once the words had now been spoken that for so many hours she knew had lain unspoken within her own breast yes if she did not she could never know a moments peace feeling that she was forcing him to a death in life desecrating her own love and pride and the spur had been given by another the thought that someonethis hard old woman of the hard worldshould have shaped in words the hauntings of her love and pride through all those ages since miltoun spoke to her of his resolve that someone else should have had to tell her what her heart had so long known it must dothis stabbed her like a knife this at all events she could not bear  she stood up and said  please leave me now i have a great many things to do before i go  with a sort of pleasure she saw a look of bewilderment cover that old face with a sort of pleasure she marked the trembling of the hands raising their owner from the chair and heard the stammering in the voice you are going beforebefore he comes youyou wont be seeing him again with a sort of pleasure she marked the hesitation which did not know whether to thank or bless or just say nothing and creep away with a sort of pleasure she watched the flush mount in the faded cheeks the faded lips pressed together then at the scarcely whispered words thank you my dear she turned unable to bear further sight or sound she went to the window and pressed her forehead against the glass trying to think of nothing she heard the sound of wheelslady casterley had gone and then of all the awful feelings man or woman can know she experienced the worst she could not cry  at this most bitter and deserted moment of her life she felt strangely calm foreseeing clearly exactly what she must do and where go quickly it must be done or it would never be done quickly and without fuss she put some things together sent the maid out for a cab and sat down to write  she must do and say nothing that could excite him and bring back his illness let it all be sober reasonable it would be easy to let him know where she was going to write a letter that would bring him flying after her but to write the calm reasonable words that would keep him waiting and thinking till he never again came to her broke her heart  when she had finished and sealed the letter she sat motionless with a numb feeling in hands and brain trying to realize what she had next to do to go and that was all  her trunks had been taken down already she chose the little hat that he liked her best in and over it fastened her thickest veil then putting on her travelling coat and gloves she looked in the long mirror and seeing that there was nothing more to keep her lifted her dressing bag and went down  over on the embankment a child was crying and the passionate screaming sound broken by the gulping of tears made her cover her lips as though she had heard her own escaped soul wailing out there  she leaned out of the cab to say to the maid  go and comfort that crying ella  only when she was alone in the train secure from all eyes did she give way to desperate weeping the white smoke rolling past the windows was not more evanescent than her joy had been for she had no illusionsit was over from first to lastnot quite a year but even at this moment not for all the world would she have been without her love gone to its grave like a dead child that evermore would be touching her breast with its wistful fingers     chapter xxvii  barbara returning from her visit to courtiers deserted rooms was met at valleys house with the message would she please go at once to lady casterley  when in obedience she reached ravensham she found her grandmother and lorddennis in the white room they were standing by one of the tall windows apparently contemplating the view they turned indeed at sound of barbaras approach but neither of them spoke or nodded not having seen her grandfather since before miltouns illness barbara found it strange to be so treated she too took her stand silently before the window a very large wasp was crawling up the pane then slipping down with a faint buzz  suddenly lady casterley spoke  kill that thing  lord dennis drew forth his handkerchief  not with that dennis it will make a mess take a paper knife  i was going to put it out murmured lord dennis  let barbara with her gloves  barbara moved towards the pane  its a hornet i think she said  so he is said lord dennis dreamily  nonsense murmured lady casterley its a common wasp  i know its a hornet granny the rings are darker  lady casterley bent down when she raised herself she had a slipper in her hand  dont irritate him cried barbara catching her wrist but lady casterley freed her hand  i will she said and brought the sole of the slipper down on the insect so that it dropped on the floor dead he has no business in here  and as if that little incident had happened to three other people they again stood silently looking through the window  then lady casterley turned to barbara  well have you realized the mischief that youve done  ann murmured lord dennis  yes yes she is your favourite but that wont save her this womanto her great crediti say to her great credithas gone away so as to put herself out of eustaces reach until he has recovered his senses  with a sharpdrawn breath barbara said  oh poor thing  but on lady casterleys face had come an almost cruel look  ah she said exactly but curiously enough i am thinking of eustace her little figure was quivering from head to foot this will be a lesson to you not to play with fire  ann murmured lord dennis again slipping his arm through barbaras  the world went on lady casterley is a place of facts not of romantic fancies you have done more harm than can possibly be repaired i went to her myself i was very much moved if it hadnt been for your foolish conduct  ann said lord dennis once more  lady casterley paused tapping the floor with her little foot barbaras eyes were gleaming  is there anything else you would like to squash dear  babs murmured lord dennis but unconsciously pressing his hand against her heart the girl went on  you are lucky to be abusing me todayif it had been yesterday  at these dark words lady casterley turned away her shoes leaving little dull stains on the polished floor  barbara raised to her cheek the fingers which she had been so convulsively embracing dont let her go on uncle she whispered not just now  no no my dear lord dennis murmured certainly notit is enough  it has been your sentimental folly came lady casterleys voice from a far corner which has brought this on the boy  responding to the pressure of the hand back now at her waist barbara did not answer and the sound of the little feet retracing their steps rose in the stillness neither of those two at the window turned their heads once more the feet receded and again began coming back  suddenly barbara pointing to the floor cried  oh granny for heavens sake stand still havent you squashed the hornet enough even if he did come in where he hadnt any business  lady casterley looked down at the debris of the insect  disgusting she said but when she next spoke it was in a less hard more querulous voice  that manwhat was his namehave you got rid of him  barbara went crimson  abuse my friends and i will go straight home and never speak to you again  for a moment lady casterley looked almost as if she might strike her granddaughter then a little sardonic smile broke out on her face  a creditable sentiment she said  letting fall her uncles hand barbara cried  in any case id better go i dont know why you sent for me  lady casterley answered coldly  to let you and your mother know of this womans most unselfish behaviour to put you on the qui vive for what eustace may do now to give you a chance to make up for your folly moreover to warn you against she paused  yes  let me interrupted lord dennis  no uncle dennis let granny take her shoe  she had withdrawn against the wall tall and as it were formidable with her head up lady casterley remained silent  have you got it ready cried barbara unfortunately hes flown  a voice said  lord miltoun  he had come in quietly and quickly preceding the announcement and stood almost touching that little group at the window before they caught sight of him his face had the rather ghastly look of sunburnt faces from which emotion has driven the blood and his eyes always so much the most living part of him were full of such stabbing anger that involuntarily they all looked down  i want to speak to you alone he said to lady casterley  visibly for perhaps the first time in her life that indomitable little figure flinched lord dennis drew barbara away but at the door he whispered  stay here quietly babs i dont like the look of this  unnoticed barbara remained hovering  the two voices low and so far off in the long white room were uncannily distinct emotion charging each word with preternatural power of penetration and every movement of the speakers had to the girls excited eyes a weird precision as of little figures she had once seen at a paris puppet show she could hear miltoun reproaching his grandmother in words terribly dry and bitter she edged nearer and nearer till seeing that they paid no more heed to her than if she were an attendant statue she had regained her position by the window  lady casterley was speaking  i was not going to see you ruined before my eyes eustace i did what i did at very great cost i did my best for you  barbara saw miltouns face transfigured by a dreadful smilethe smile of one defying his torturer with hate lady casterley went on  yes you stand there looking like a devil hate me if you likebut dont betray us moaning and moping because you cant have the moon put on your armour and go down into the battle dont play the coward boy  miltouns answer cut like the lash of a whip  by god be silent  and weirdly there was silence it was not the brutality of the words but the sight of force suddenly naked of all disguiselike a fierce dog let for a moment off its chainwhich made barbara utter a little dismayed sound lady casterley had dropped into a chair trembling and without a look miltoun passed her if their grandmother had fallen dead barbara knew he would not have stopped to see she ran forward but the old woman waved her away  go after him she said dont let him go alone  and infected by the fear in that wizened voice barbara flew  she caught her brother as he was entering the taxicab in which he had come and without a word slipped in beside him the drivers face appeared at the window but miltoun only motioned with his head as if to say anywhere away from here  the thought flashed through barbara if only i can keep him in here with me  she leaned out and said quietly  to nettlefold in sussexnever mind your petrolget more on the road you can have what fare you like quick  the man hesitated looked in her face and said  very well miss by dorking aint it  barbara nodded     chapter xxviii  the clock over the stables was chiming seven when miltoun and barbara passed out of the tall iron gates in their swiftmoving small world that smelled faintly of petrol though the cab was closed light spurts of rain drifted in through the open windows refreshing the girls hot face relieving a little her dread of this drive for now that fate had been really cruel now that it no longer lay in miltouns hands to save himself from suffering her heart bled for him and she remembered to forget herself the immobility with which he had received her intrusion was ominous and though silent in her corner she was desperately working all her womans wits to discover a way of breaking into the house of his secret mood he appeared not even to have noticed that they had turned their backs on london and passed into richmond park  here the trees made dark by rain seemed to watch gloomily the progress of this whirringwheeled red box unreconciled even yet to such harsh intruders on their windscented tranquillity and the deer pursuing happiness on the sweet grasses raised disquieted noses as who should say poisoners of the fern defilers of the trails of air  barbara vaguely felt the serenity out there in the clouds and the trees and wind if it would but creep into this dim travelling prison and help her if it would but come like sleep and steal away dark sorrow and in one moment make griefjoy but it stayed outside on its wistful wings and that grand chasm which yawns between soul and soul remained unbridged for what could she say how make him speak of what he was going to do what alternatives indeed were now before him would he sullenly resign his seat and wait till he could find audrey noel again but even if he did find her they would only be where they were she had gone in order not to be a drag on himit would only be the same thing all over again would he then as granny had urged him put on his armour and go down into the fight but that indeed would mean the end for if she had had the strength to go away now she would surely never come back and break in on his life a second time and a grim thought swooped down on barbara what if he resigned everything went out into the dark men did sometimesshe knewcaught like this in the full flush of passion but surely not miltoun with his faith if the larks song means nothingif that sky is a morass of our inventionif we are pettily creeping on furthering nothingpersuade me of it babs and ill bless you but had he still that anchorage to prevent him slipping out to sea this sudden thought of death to one for whom life was joy who had never even seen the great stillness was very terrifying she fixed her eyes on the back of the chauffeur in his drab coat with the red collar finding some comfort in its solidity they were in a taxicab in richmond park deathincongruous incredible death it was stupid to be frightened she forced herself to look at miltoun he seemed to be asleep his eyes were closed his arms foldedonly a quivering of his eyelids betrayed him impossible to tell what was going on in that grim waking sleep which made her feel that she was not there at all so utterly did he seem withdrawn into himself  he opened his eyes and said suddenly  so you think im going to lay hands on myself babs  horribly startled by this reading of her thoughts barbara could only edge away and stammer  no oh no  where are we going in this thing  nettlefold would you like him stopped  it will do as well as anywhere  terrified lest he should relapse into that grim silence she timidly possessed herself of his hand  it was fast growing dark the cab having left the villas of surbiton behind was flying along at great speed among pinetrees and stretches of heather gloomy with faded daylight  miltoun said presently in a queer slow voice if i want i have only to open that door and jump you who believe that tomorrow we diegive me the faith to feel that i can free myself by that jump and out i go then seeming to pity her terrified squeeze of his hand he added its all right babs we shall sleep comfortably enough in our beds tonight  but so desolate to the girl was his voice that she hoped now for silence  let us be skinned quietly muttered miltoun if nothing else sorry to have disturbed you  pressing close up to him barbara murmured  if onlytalk to me  but miltoun though he stroked her hand was silent  the cab moving at unaccustomed speed along these deserted roads moaned dismally and barbara was possessed now by a desire which she dared not put in practice to pull his head down and rock it against her her heart felt empty and timid to have something warm resting on it would have made all the difference everything real substantial comforting seemed to have slipped away among these flying dark ghosts of pinetreesas it were the unfrequented borderland between two worldsthe feeling of a cheek against her breast alone could help muffle the deep disquiet in her lost like a child in a wood  the cab slackened speed the driver was lighting his lamps and his red face appeared at the window  well ave to stop here miss im out of petrol will you get some dinner or go through  through answered barbara  while they were passing the little time buying then petrol asking the way she felt less miserable and even looked about her with a sort of eagerness then when they had started again she thought if i could get him to sleepthe sea will comfort him but his eyes were staring wideopen she feigned sleep herself letting her head slip a little to one side causing small sounds of breathing to escape the whirring of the wheels the moaning of the cab joints the dark trees slipping by the scent of the wet fern drifting in all these must surely help and presently she felt that he was indeed slipping into darknessand thenshe felt nothing  when she awoke from the sleep into which she had seen miltoun fall the cab was slowly mounting a steep hill above which the moon had risen the air smelled strong and sweet as though it had passed over leagues of grass  the downs she thought i must have been asleep  in sudden terror she looked round for miltoun but he was still there exactly as before leaning back rigid in his corner of the cab with staring eyes and no other signs of life and still only half awake like a great warm sleepy child startled out of too deep slumber she clutched and clung to him the thought that he had been sitting like that with his spirit far away all the time that she had been betraying her watch in sleep was dreadful but to her embrace there was no response and awake indeed now ashamed sore barbara released him and turned her face to the air  out there two thin denseblack long clouds shaped like the wings of a hawk had joined themselves together so that nothing of the moon showed but a living brightness imprisoned like the eyes and life of a bird between those swift sweeps of darkness this great uncanny spirit brooding malevolent over the high leagues of moonwan grass seemed waiting to swoop and pluck up in its talons and devour all that intruded on the wild loneness of these farup plains of freedom barbara almost expected to hear coming from it the lost whistle of the buzzard hawks and her dream came back to her where were her wingsthe wings that in sleep had borne her to the stars the wings that would never lift herwakingfrom the ground where too were miltouns wings she crouched back into her corner a tear stole up and trickled out between her closed lidsanother and another followed faster and faster they came then she felt miltouns arm round her and heard him say dont cry babs instinct telling her what to do she laid her head against his chest and sobbed bitterly struggling with those sobs she grew less and less unhappyknowing that he could never again feel quite so desolate as before he tried to give her comfort it was all a bad dream and they would soon wake from it and they would be happy as happy as they had been beforebefore these last months and she whispered  only a little while eusty     chapter xxix  old lady harbinger dying in the early february of the following year the marriage of barbara with her son was postponed till june  much of the wild sweetness of spring still clung to the high moor borders of monkland on the early morning of the wedding day  barbara was already up and dressed for riding when her maid came to call her and noting staceys astonished eyes fix themselves on her boots she said  well stacey  itll tire you  nonsense im not going to be hung  refusing the company of a groom she made her way towards the stretch of high moor where she had ridden with courtier a year ago here over the short as yet unflowering heather there was a mile or more of level galloping ground she mounted steadily and her spirit rode as it were before her longing to get up there among the peewits and curlew to feel the crisp peaty earth slip away under her and the wind drive in her face under that deep blue sky carried by this warmblooded sweetheart of hers ready to jump out of his smooth hide with pleasure snuffling and sneezing in sheer joy whose eye she could see straying round to catch a glimpse of her intentions from whose lips she could hear issuing the sweet bittmusic whose vagaries even seemed designed to startle from her a closer embracingshe was filled with a sort of delicious impatience with everything that was not this perfect communing with vigour  reaching the top she put him into a gallop with the wind furiously assailing her face and throat every muscle crisped and all her blood tinglingthis was a very ecstasy of motion  she reined in at the cairn whence she and courtier had looked down at the herds of ponies it was the merest memory now vague and a little sweet like the remembrance of some exceptional spring day when trees seem to flower before your eyes and in sheer wantonness exhale a scent of lemons the ponies were there still and in distance the shining sea she sat thinking of nothing but how good it was to be alive the fullness and sweetness of it all the freedom and strength away to the west over a lonely farm she could see two buzzard hawks hunting in wide circles she did not envy themso happy was she as happy as the morning and there came to her suddenly the true the overmastering longing of mountain tops  i must she thought i simply must  slipping off her horse she lay down on her back and at once everything was lost except the sky over her body supported above solid earth by the warm soft heather the wind skimmed without sound or touch her spirit became one with that calm unimaginable freedom transported beyond her own contentment she no longer even knew whether she was joyful  the horse hal attempting to eat her sleeve aroused her she mounted him and rode down near home she took a short cut across a meadow through which flowed two thin bright streams forming a delta full of lingering milkmaids mauve marsh orchis and yellow flags from end to end of this long meadow so varied so pied with trees and stones and flowers and water the last of the spring was passing  some ponies shyly curious of barbara and her horse stole up and stood at a safe distance with their noses dubiously stretched out swishing their lean tails and suddenly far up following their own music two cuckoos flew across seeking the thorntrees out on the moor while she was watching the arrowy birds she caught sight of someone coming towards her from a clump of beechtrees and suddenly saw that it was mrs noel  she rode forward flushing what dared she say could she speak of her wedding and betray miltouns presence could she open her mouth at all without rousing painful feeling of some sort then impatient of indecision she began  im so glad to see you again i didnt know you were still down here  i only came back to england yesterday and im just here to see to the packing of my things  oh murmured barbara you know whats happening to me i suppose  mrs noel smiled looked up and said i heard last night all joy to you  a lump rose in barbaras throat  im so glad to have seen you she murmured once more i expect i ought to be getting on and with the word goodbye gently echoed she rode away  but her mood of delight was gone even the horse hal seemed to tread unevenly for all that he was going back to that stable which ever appeared to him desirable ten minutes after he had left it  except that her eyes seemed darker mrs noel had not changed if she had shown the faintest sign of selfpity the girl would never have felt as she did now so sorry and upset  leaving the stables she saw that the wind was driving up a huge white shining cloud isnt it going to be fine after all she thought  reentering the house by an old and socalled secret stairway that led straight to the library she had to traverse that great dark room there buried in an armchair in front of the hearth she saw miltoun with a book on his knee not reading but looking up at the picture of the old cardinal she hurried on tiptoeing over the soft carpet holding her breath fearful of disturbing the queer interview feeling guilty too of her new knowledge which she did not mean to impart she had burnt her fingers once at the flame between them she would not do so a second time  through the window at the far end she saw that the cloud had burst it was raining furiously she regained her bedroom unseen in spite of her joy out there on the moor this last adventure of her girlhood had not been all success she had again the old sensations the old doubts the dissatisfaction which she had thought dead those two to shut ones eyes and be happywas it possible a great rainbow the nearest she had ever seen had sprung up in the park and was come to earth again in some fields close by the sun was shining out already through the winddriven bright rain jewels of blue had begun to star the black and white and golden clouds a strange white lightghost of spring passing in this last violent outburstpainted the leaves of every tree and a hundred savage hues had come down like a motley of bright birds on moor and fields  the moment of desperate beauty caught barbara by the throat its spirit of galloping wildness flew straight into her heart she clasped her hands across her breast to try and keep that moment far out a cuckoo hootedand the immortal call passed on the wind in that call all the beauty and colour and rapture of life seemed to be flying by if she could only seize and evermore have it in her heart as the buttercups out there imprisoned the sun or the fallen raindrops on the sweetbriars round the windows enclosed all changing light if only there were no chains no walls and finality were dead  her clock struck ten at this time tomorrow her cheeks turned hot in a mirror she could see them burning her lips scornfully curved her eyes strange standing there she looked long at herself till little by little her face lost every vestige of that disturbance became solid and resolute again she ceased to have the galloping wild feeling in her heart and instead felt cold detached from herself she watched with contentment her own calm and radiant beauty resume the armour it had for that moment put off  after dinner that night when the men left the dininghall miltoun slipped away to his den of all those present in the little church he had seemed most unemotional and had been most moved though it had been so quiet and private a wedding he had resented all cheap festivity accompanying the passing of his young sister he would have had that ceremony in the little dark disused chapel at the court those two and the priest alone here in this halfpagan little country church smothered hastily in flowers with the raw singing of the halfpagan choir and all the village curiosity and homageeverything had jarred and the stale aftermath sickened him changing his swallowtail to an old smoking jacket he went out on to the lawn in the wide darkness he could rid himself of his exasperation  since the day of his election he had not once been at monkland since mrs noels flight he had never left london in london and work he had buried himself by london and work he had saved himself he had gone down into the battle  dew had not yet fallen and he took the path across the fields there was no moon no stars no wind the cattle were noiseless under the trees there were no owls calling no nightjars churring the flybynight chafers were not abroad the stream alone was alive in the quiet darkness and as miltoun followed the wispy line of grey path cleaving the dim glamour of daisies and buttercups there came to him the feeling that he was in the presence not of sleep but of eternal waiting the sound of his footfalls seemed desecration so devotional was that hush burning the spicy incense of millions of leaves and blades of grass  crossing the last stile he came out close to her deserted cottage under her limetree which on the night of courtiers adventure had hung blueblack round the moon on that side only a rail and a few shrubs confined her garden  the house was all dark but the many tall white flowers like a bright vapour rising from earth clung to the air above the beds leaning against the tree miltoun gave himself to memory  from the silent boughs which drooped round his dark figure a little sleepy bird uttered a faint cheep a hedgehog or some small beast of night rustled away in the grass close by a moth flew past seeking its candle flame and something in miltouns heart took wings after it searching for the warmth and light of his blown candle of love then in the hush he heard a sound as of a branch ceaselessly trailed through long grass fainter and fainter more and more distinct again fainter but nothing could he see that should make that homeless sound and the sense of some near but unseen presence crept on him till the hair moved on his scalp if god would light the moon or stars and let him see if god would end the expectation of this night let one wan glimmer down into her garden and one wan glimmer into his breast but it stayed dark and the homeless noise never ceased the weird thought came to miltoun that it was made by his own heart wandering out there trying to feel warm again he closed his eyes and at once knew that it was not his heart but indeed some external presence unconsoled and stretching his hands out he moved forward to arrest that sound as he reached the railing it ceased and he saw a flame leap up a pale broad pathway of light blanching the grass  and realizing that she was there within he gasped his fingernails bent and broke against the iron railing without his knowing it was not as on that night when the red flowers on her windowsill had wafted their scent to him it was no sheer overpowering rush of passion profounder more terrible was this rising up within him of yearning for loveas if now defeated it would nevermore stir but lie dead on that dark grass beneath those dark boughs and if victoriouswhat then he stole back under the tree  he could see little white moths travelling down that path of lamplight he could see the white flowers quite plainly now a pale watch of blossoms guarding the dark sleepy ones and he stood not reasoning hardly any longer feeling stunned battered by struggle his face and hands were sticky with the honeydew slowly invisibly distilling from the limetree he bent down and felt the grass and suddenly there came over him the certainty of her presence yes she was thereout on the verandah he could see her white figure from head to foot and not realizing that she could not see him he expected her to utter some cry but no sound came from her no gesture she turned back into the house miltoun ran forward to the railing but there once more he stoppedunable to think unable to feel as it were abandoned by himself and he suddenly found his hand up at his mouth as though there were blood there to be staunched that had escaped from his heart  still holding that hand before his mouth and smothering the sound of his feet in the long grass he crept away     chapter xxx  in the great glass house at ravensham lady casterley stood close to some japanese lilies with a letter in her hand her face was very white for it was the first day she had been allowed down after an attack of influenza nor had the hand in which she held the letter its usual steadiness she read   monkland court  just a line dear before the post goes to tell you that babs has gone off happily the child looked beautiful she sent you her love and some absurd messagethat you would be glad to hear she was perfectly safe with both feet firmly on the ground  a grim little smile played on lady casterleys pale lipsyes indeed and time too the child had been very near the edge of the cliffs very near committing a piece of romantic folly that was well over and raising the letter again she read on  we were all down for it of course and come back tomorrow geoffrey is quite cut up things cant be what they were without our babs ive watched eustace very carefully and i really believe hes safely over that affair at last he is doing extraordinarily well in the house just now geoffrey says his speech on the poor law was head and shoulders the best made   lady casterley let fall the hand which held the letter safe yes he was safe he had done the rightthe natural thing and in time he would be happy he would rise now to that pinnacle of desired authority which she had dreamed of for him ever since he was a tiny thing ever since his little thin brown hand had clasped hers in their wanderings amongst the flowers and the furniture of tall rooms but as she stoodcrumpling the letter greywhite as some small resolute ghost among her tall lilies that filled with their scent the great glass houseshadows flitted across her face was it the fugitive noon sunshine or was it some glimmering perception of the old greek sayingcharacter is fate some sudden sense of the universal truth that all are in bond to their own natures and what a man has most desired shall in the end enslave him
