              ————     chapter i     a pretty girl stood alone on the jetty of an oldfashioned wharf at wapping looking down upon the silent deck of a schooner below no smoke issued from the sootstained cowl of the galley and the forescuttle and the companion were both inhospitably closed the quiet of evening was over everything broken only by the whirr of the paddles of a passenger steamer as it passed carefully up the centre of the river or the plash of a lighterman’s huge sweep as he piloted his unwieldy craft down on the last remnant of the ebbtide in shore various craft sat lightly on the soft thames mud some sheeting a rigid uprightness others with their decks at various angles of discomfort  the girl stood a minute or two in thought and put her small foot out tentatively towards the rigging some few feet distant it was an awkward jump and she was still considering it when she heard footsteps behind and a young man increasing his pace as he saw her came rapidly on to the jetty  this is the foam isn’t it enquired the girl as he stood expectantly i want to see captain flower  he went ashore about half an hour ago said the other  the girl tapped impatiently with her foot you don’t know what time he’ll be back i suppose she enquired  he shook his head i think he’s gone for the evening he said pondering he was very careful about his dress  the ghost of a smile trembled on the girl’s lips he has gone to call for me she said i must have missed him i wonder what i’d better do  wait here till he comes back said the man without hesitation  the girl wavered i suppose he’ll guess i’ve come here she said thoughtfully  sure to said the other promptly  it’s a long way to poplar she said reflectively you’re mr fraser the mate i suppose captain flower has spoken to me about you  that’s my name said the other  my name’s tyrell said the girl smiling i daresay you’ve heard captain flower mention it  must have done said fraser slowly he stood looking at the girl before him at her dark hair and shining dark eyes inwardly wondering why the captain a fervid admirer of the sex had not mentioned her  will you come on board and wait he asked i’ll bring a chair up on deck for you if you will  the girl stood a moment in consideration and then with another faint reference to the distance of poplar from wapping assented the mate sprang nimbly into the ratlins and then extending a hand helped her carefully to the deck  how nice it feels to be on a ship again said the girl looking contentedly about her as the mate brought up a canvas chair from below i used to go with my father sometimes when he was alive but i haven’t been on a ship now for two years or more  the mate who was watching her closely made no reply he was thinking that a straw hat with scarlet flowers went remarkably well with the dark eyes and hair beneath it and also that the deck of the schooner had never before seemed such an inviting place as it was at this moment  captain flower keeps his ship in good condition said the visitor somewhat embarrassed by his gaze  he takes a pride in her said fraser and it’s his uncle’s craft so there’s no stint she never wants for paint or repairs and flower’s as nice a man to sail under as one could wish we’ve had the same crew for years  he’s very kind and jolly said the girl  he’s one of the best fellows breathing said the mate warmly he saved my life once—went overboard after me when we were doing over ten knots an hour and was nearly drowned himself  that was fine of him said miss tyrell eagerly he never told me anything about it and i think that’s rather fine too i like brave men have you ever been overboard after anybody  fraser shook his head somewhat despondently i’m not much of a swimmer said he  but you’d go in for anybody if you saw them drowning persisted miss tyrell in a surprised voice  i don’t know i’m sure said fraser i hope i should  do you mean to say said miss tyrell severely that if i fell into the river here for instance you wouldn’t jump in and try to save me  of course i should said fraser hotly i should jump in after you if i couldn’t swim a stroke  miss tyrell somewhat taken aback murmured her gratification  i should go in after you continued the mate who was loath to depart from the subject if it was blowing a gale and the sea full of sharks  what a blessing it is there are no sharks round our coast said miss tyrell in somewhat of a hurry to get away from the mate’s heroism have you ever seen one  saw them in the indian ocean when i was an apprentice replied fraser  you’ve been on foreigngoing ships then said the girl i wonder you gave it up for this  this suits me better said fraser my father’s an old man and he wanted me home i shall have a little steamer he’s got an interest in as soon as her present skipper goes so it’s just as well for me to know these waters  in this wise they sat talking until evening gave way to night and the deck of the foam was obscured in shadow lamps were lit on the wharves and passing craft hung out their sidelights the girl rose to her feet  i won’t wait any longer i must be going she said  he may be back at any moment urged the mate  no i’d better go thank you replied the girl it’s getting late i don’t like going home alone  i’ll come with you if you’ll let me said the mate eagerly  all the way said miss tyrell with the air of one bargaining  of course said fraser  well i’ll give him another halfhour then said the girl calmly shall we go down to the cabin it’s rather chilly up here now  the mate showed her below and lighting the lamp took a seat opposite and told her a few tales of the sea culled when he was an apprentice and credulous of ear miss tyrell retaliated with some told her by her father from which fraser was able to form his own opinion of that estimable mariner the last story was of a humourous nature and the laughter which ensued grated oddly on the ear of the sturdy goodlooking seaman who had just come on board he stopped at the companion for a moment listening in amazement and then hastily descending entered the cabin  poppy he cried why i’ve been waiting up at the wheelers’ for you for nearly a couple of hours  i must have missed you said miss tyrell serenely annoying isn’t it  the master of the foam said it was and seemed from his manner to be anxious to do more justice to the subject than that  i didn’t dream you’d come down here he said at length  no you never invited me so i came without said the girl softly it’s a dear little schooner and i like it very much i shall come often  a slight shade passed over captain flower’s face but he said nothing  you must take me back now said miss tyrell goodbye mr fraser  she held out her hand to the mate and giving a friendly pressure left the cabin followed by flower  the mate let them get clear of the ship and then clambering on to the jetty watched them off the wharf and plunging his hands into his pockets whistled softly  poppy tyrell he said to himself slowly poppy tyrell i wonder why the skipper has never mentioned her i wonder why she took his arm i wonder whether she knows that he’s engaged to be married  deep in thought he paced slowly up and down the wharf and then wandered listlessly round the piledup empties and bags of sugar in the open floor beneath the warehouse a glance through the windows of the office showed him the watchman slumbering peacefully by the light of a solitary gasjet and he went back to the schooner and gazed at the dark water and the dim shapes of the neighbouring craft in a vein of gentle melancholy he walked to the place where her chair had been and tried to conjure up the scene again then becoming uncertain as to the exact spot went down to the cabin where the locker being immovable no such difficulty presented itself he gazed his fill and then smoking a meditative pipe turned in and fell fast asleep  he was awakened suddenly from a dream of rescuing a small shark surrounded by a horde of hungry poppies by the hurried and dramatic entrance of captain fred flower the captain’s eyes were wild and his face harassed and he unlocked the door of his stateroom and stood with the handle of it in his hand before he paused to answer the question in the mate’s sleepy eyes  it’s all right jack he said breathlessly  i’m glad of that said the mate calmly  i hurried a bit said the skipper  anxious to see me again i suppose said the mate what are you listening for  thought i heard somebody in the water as i came aboard said flower glibly  what have you been up to enquired the other quickly  captain flower turned and regarded him with a look of offended dignity  good heavens don’t look like that said the mate misreading it you haven’t chucked anybody overboard have you  if anybody should happen to come aboard this vessel said flower without deigning to reply to the question and ask questions about the master of it he’s as unlike me jack as any two people in this world can be d’ye understand  you’d better tell me what you’ve been up to urged the mate  as for your inquisitiveness jack it don’t become you said flower with severity but i don’t suppose it’ll be necessary to trouble you at all  he walked out of the cabin and stood listening at the foot of the companionladder and the mate heard him walk a little way up when he reentered the cabin his face had cleared and he smiled comfortably  i shall just turn in for an hour he said amiably goodnight jack  goodnight said the curious mate i say—— he sat up suddenly in his bunk and looked seriously at the skipper  well said the other  i suppose said the mate with a slight cough—i suppose it’s nothing about that girl that was down here  certainly not said flower violently he extinguished the lamp and entering his stateroom closed the door and locked it and the mate after lying a little while drowsily wondering what it all meant fell asleep again     chapter ii     while the skipper and mate slumbered peacefully below the watchman sat on a post at the extreme end of the jetty yearning for human society and gazing fearfully behind him at the silent dimlylit wharf the two gaslamps high up on the walls gave but a faint light and in no way dispelled the deep shadows thrown by the cranes and the piledup empties which littered the place he gazed intently at the dark opening of the floor beneath the warehouse half fancying that he could again discern the veiled apparition which had looked in at him through the office window and had finally vanished before his horrorstruck eyes in a corner the only outlet to which was a grating albeit a careful man and tender the watchman pinched himself he was awake and rubbing the injured part swore softly  if i go down and tell ’em he murmured softly in allusion to the crew what’ll they do laugh at me  he glanced behind him again and rising hastily to his feet nearly fell on to the deck below as a dark figure appeared for a moment at the opening and then vanished again with more alacrity than might have been expected of a man of his figure he dropped into the rigging and lowered himself on to the schooner  the scuttle was open and the seamen’s lusty snores fell upon his ears like sweet music he backed down the ladder and groped in the darkness towards the bunks with outstretched hand one snore stopped instantly  eh said a sleepy voice wot ’ere what the blazes are you up to  a’ right joe said the watchman cheerfully  but it ain’t all right said the seaman sharply comin’ down in the dark an’ ketchin’ ’old o’ people’s noses give me quite a start you did  it’s nothing to the start i’ve ’ad said the other pathetically there’s a ghost on the wharf joe i want you to come up with me and see what it is  yes i’m sure to do that said joe turning over in his bunk till it creaked with his weight go away and let me get to sleep again i don’t get a night’s rest like you do you know  what’s the matter enquired a sleepy voice  old george ’ere ses there’s a ghost on the wharf said joe  i’ve seen it three times said the watchman eager for sympathy  i expect it’s a deathwarning for you george said the voice solemnly the last watchman died sudden you remember  so he did said joe  his ’art was wrong said george curtly ’ad been for years  well we can’t do nothin’ for you george said joe kindly it’s no good us going up we sha’n’t see it it isn’t meant for us  ’ow d’yer know it’s a ghost said a third voice impatiently very likely while you’re all jawing about it down ’ere it’s aburglin’ the offis  joe gave a startled grunt and rolling out of his bunk grabbed his trousers and began to dress three other shadowy forms followed suit and hastily dressing followed the watchman on deck and gained the wharf they went through the gloomy ground floor in a body yawning sleepily  i shouldn’t like to be a watchman said a young ordinary seaman named tim with a shiver a ghost might easy do anything with you while you was all alone p’r’aps it walks up an’ down behind you george makin’ faces we shall be gorn in another hour george  the office when they reached it was undisturbed and staying only long enough to drink the watchman’s coffee which was heating on a gasjet they left it and began to search the wharf joe leading with a small lantern  are we all ’ere demanded tim suddenly  i am said the cook emphatically  ’cos i see su’thing right behind them bags o’ sugar said the youth clutching hold of the cook on one side and the watchman on the other spread out a bit chaps  joe dashed boldly round with the lantern there was a faint scream and an exclamation of triumph from the seaman i’ve got it he shouted  the others followed hastily and saw the fearless joe firmly gripping the apparition at the sight the cook furtively combed his hair with his fingers while tim modestly buttoned up his jacket  take this lantern so’s i can hold her better said joe extending it  the cook took it from him and holding it up revealed the face of a tall goodlooking woman of some seven or eight and twenty  what are you doin’ here demanded the watchman with official austerity  i’m waiting for a friend of mine said the visitor struggling with joe make this man leave go of me please  joe said the watchman with severity i’m ashamed of you who is your friend miss  his name is robinson said the lady he came on here about an hour ago i’m waiting for him  there’s nobody here said the watchman shaking his head  i’m not sure he didn’t go on that little ship said the lady but if he has i suppose i can wait here till he comes off i’m not doing any harm  the ship’ll sail in about an hour’s time miss said tim regretfully but there ain’t nobody o’ the name of robinson aboard her all the crew’s ’ere and there’s only the skipper and mate on her besides  you can’t deceive me young man so don’t try it said the lady sharply i followed him on here and he hasn’t gone off because the gate has been locked since  i can’t think who the lady means said joe  i ain’t seen nobody come aboard if he did he’s down the cabin  well i’ll go down there said the lady promptly  well miss it’s nothing to do with us said joe but it’s my opinion you’ll find the skipper and mate has turned in  well i’m going down said the lady gripping her parasol firmly by the middle they can’t eat me  she walked towards the foam followed by the perplexed crew and with the able assistance of five pairs of hands reached the deck the companion was open and at joe’s whispered instructions she turned and descended the steps backwards  it was at first quite dark in the cabin but as the visitor’s eyes became accustomed to it she could just discern the outlines of a small table while a steady breathing assured her that somebody was sleeping close by feeling her way to the table she discovered a locker and taking a seat coughed gently the breathing continuing quite undisturbed she coughed again twice  the breathing stopped suddenly who the devil’s that coughing asked a surprised voice  i beg pardon i’m sure said the visitor but is there a mr robinson down here  the reply was so faint and smothered that she could not hear it it was evident that the speaker a modest man was now speaking from beneath the bedclothes  is mr robinson here she repeated loudly  never heard of him said the smothered voice  it’s my opinion said the visitor hotly that you’re trying to deceive me have you got a match  the owner of the voice said that he had not and with chilly propriety added that he wouldn’t give it to her if he had whereupon the lady rose and fumbling on the little mantelpiece found a box and struck one there was a lamp nailed to the bulkhead over the mantelpiece and calmly removing the chimney she lit it  a red excited face with the bedclothes fast about its neck appeared in a small bunk and stared at her in speechless amaze the visitor returned his gaze calmly and then looked carefully round the cabin  where does that lead to she asked pointing to the door of the stateroom  the mate remembering in time the mysterious behaviour of flower considered the situation that’s the pantry he said untruthfully  the visitor rose and tried the handle the door was locked and she looked doubtfully at the mate i suppose that’s a leg of mutton i can hear asleep in there she said with acerbity  you can suppose what you like said the mate testily why don’t you go away i’m surprised at you  you’ll be more surprised before i’ve done with you said the lady with emotion my fred’s in there and you know it  your fred said fraser in great surprise  mr robinson said the visitor correcting herself  i tell you there’s nobody in there except the skipper said the mate  you said it was the pantry just now exclaimed the other sharply  the skipper sleeps in the pantry so’s he can keep his eye on the meat explained fraser  the visitor looked at him angrily what sort of a man is he she enquired suddenly  you’ll soon know if he comes out said the mate he’s the worsttempered man afloat i should think if he comes out and finds you here i don’t know what he’ll do  i’m not afraid of him said the other with spirit what do you call him skipper  the mate nodded and the visitor tapped loudly at the door skipper she cried skipper  no answer being vouchsafed she repeated her cry in a voice louder than before  he’s a heavy sleeper said the perturbed fraser better go away there’s a good girl  the lady scornfully ignoring him rapped on the door and again called upon its occupant then despite her assurance she sprang back with a scream as a reply burst through the door with the suddenness and fury of a thunderclap  halloa it said  my goodness said the visitor aghast what a voice what a terrible voice  she recovered herself and again approached the door  is there a gentleman named robinson in there she asked timidly  gentleman named who came the thunderclap again  robinson said the lady faintly  no no said the thunderclap then—go away it rumbled go away  the reverberation of that mighty voice rolled and shook through the cabin it even affected the mate for the visitor glancing towards him saw that he had nervously concealed himself beneath the bedclothes and was shaking with fright  i daresay his bark is worse than his bite said the visitor trembling anyway i’m going to stay here i saw mr robinson come here and i believe he’s got him in there killing him perhaps oh oh  to the mate’s consternation she began to laugh and then changed to a piercing scream and unused to the sex as he was he realised that this was the muchdreaded hysteria of which he had often heard and he faced her with a face as pallid as her own  chuck some water over yourself he said hastily nodding at a jug which stood on the table i can’t very well get up to do it myself  the lady ignored this advice and by dint of much strength of mind regained her selfcontrol she sat down on the locker again and folding her arms showed clearly her intention to remain  half an hour passed the visitor still sat grimly upright twice she sniffed slightly and with a delicate handkerchief pushed up her veil and wiped away the faint beginnings of a tear  i suppose you think i’m acting strangely she said catching the mate’s eye after one of these episodes  oh don’t mind me said the mate with studied politeness don’t mind hurting my feelings or taking my character away  pooh you’re a man said the visitor scornfully but character or no character i’m going to see into that room before i go away if i sit here for three weeks  how’re you going to manage about eating and drinking all that time enquired fraser  how are you said the visitor you can’t get up while i’m here you know  well we’ll see said the mate vaguely  i’m sure i don’t want to annoy anybody said the visitor softly but i’ve had a lot of trouble young man and what’s worse i’ve been made a fool of this day three weeks ago i ought to have been married  i’m sure you ought murmured the other  the lady ignored the interruption  travelling under government on secret service he said he was she continued always away here today china tomorrow and america the day after  flying queried the interested mate  i daresay snapped the visitor anything to tell me i suppose we were to be married by special license i’d even got my trousseau ready  got your what ready enquired the mate to whom the word was new leaning out of his bunk  everything to wear explained the visitor all my relations bought new clothes too leastways those that could afford it did he even went and helped me choose the cake  well is that wrong asked the puzzled mate  he didn’t buy it he only chose it said the other having recourse to her handkerchief again he went outside the shop to see whether there was one he would like better and when i came out he had disappeared  he must have met with an accident said the mate politely  i saw him tonight said the lady tersely  once or twice he had mentioned wapping in conversation and then seemed to check himself that was my clue i’ve been round this dismal heathenish place for a fortnight tonight i saw him he came on this wharf and he has not gone off it’s my belief he’s in that room  before the mate could reply the hoarse voice of the watchman came down the companyway ha’ past eleven sir tide’s just on the turn  aye aye said the mate he turned imploringly to the visitor  would you do me the favour just to step on deck a minute  what for enquired the visitor shortly  because i want to get up said the mate  i sha’n’t move said the lady  but i’ve got to get up i tell you said the mate we’re getting under way in ten minutes  and what might that be asked the lady  why we make a start you’d better go ashore unless you want to be carried off  i sha’n’t move repeated the visitor  well i’m sorry to be rude said the mate george  sir said the watchman from above  bring down a couple o’ men and take this lady ashore said the mate sternly  i’ll send a couple down sir said the watchman and moved off to make a selection  i shall scream ’murder and thieves’ said the lady her eyes gleaming i’ll bring the police up and cause a scandal then perhaps i shall see into that room  in the face of determination like this the mate’s courage gave way and in a voice of much anxiety he called upon his captain for instruction  cast off bellowed the mighty voice if your sweetheart won’t go ashore she must come too you must pay her passage  well of all the damned impudence muttered the incensed mate well if you’re bent on coming he said hotly to the visitor just go on deck while i dress  the lady hesitated a moment and then withdrew on deck the men eyed her curiously but made no attempt to interfere with her and in a couple of minutes the mate came running up to take charge  where are we going enquired the lady with a trace of anxiety in her voice  france said fraser turning away  the visitor looked nervously round at the adjoining wharf a sailing barge was also getting under way and a large steamer was slowly turning in the middle of the river she took a pace or two towards the side  cast off said fraser impatiently to the watchman  wait a minute said the visitor hastily i want to think  cast off repeated the mate  the watchman obeyed and the schooner’s side moved slowly from the wharf at the sight the visitor’s nerve forsook her and with a frantic cry she ran to the side and catching the watchman’s outstretched hand sprang ashore  goodbye sang out the mate sorry you wouldn’t come to france with us the lady was afraid of the foreigners george if it had been england she wouldn’t have minded  aye aye said the watchman significantly and as the schooner showed her stern turned to answer with such lies as he thought the occasion demanded the eager questions of his fair companion     chapter iii     captain flower learning through the medium of tim that the coast was clear came on deck at limehouse and took charge of his ship with a stateliness significant of an uneasy conscience he noticed with growing indignation that the mate’s attitude was rather that of an accomplice than a subordinate and that the crew looked his way far oftener than was necessary or desirable  i told her we were going to france said the mate in an impressive whisper  her said flower curtly who  the lady you didn’t want to see said fraser restlessly  you let your ideas run away with you jack said flower yawning it wasn’t likely i was going to turn out and dress to see any girl you liked to invite aboard  or even to bawl at them through the speakingtrumpet said fraser looking at him steadily  what sort o’looking girl was she enquired flower craning his neck to see what was in front of him  looked like a girl who meant to find the man she wanted if she spent ten years over it said the mate grimly i’ll bet you an even five shillings cap’n that she finds this mr robinson before six weeks are out—whatever his other name is  maybe said flower carelessly  it’s her first visit to the foam but not the last you mark my words said fraser solemnly if she wants this rascal robinson——  what interrupted flower sharply  i say if she wants this rascal robinson repeated the mate with relish she’ll naturally come where she saw the last trace of him  captain flower grunted  women never think continued fraser judicially or else she’d be glad to get rid of such a confounded scoundrel  what do you know about him demanded flower  i know what she told me said fraser the idea of a man leaving a poor girl in a cakeshop and doing a bolt he’ll be punished for it i know he’s a thoughtless inconsiderate fellow but one of the besthearted chaps in the world and i guess i’ll do the best i can for him  flower grinned safely in the darkness and any little help i can give you jack i’ll give freely he said softly we’ll talk it over at breakfast  the mate took the hint and moving off folded his arms on the taffrail and looking idly astern fell into a reverie like the pharisee he felt thankful that he was not as other men and dimly pitied the skipper and his prosaic entanglements as he thought of poppy he looked behind at the dark and silent city and felt a new affection for it as he reflected that she was sleeping there  the two men commenced their breakfast in silence the skipper eating with a zest which caused the mate to allude impatiently to the last breakfasts of condemned men  shut the skylight jack said the skipper at length as he poured out his third cup of coffee  fraser complied and resuming his seat gazed at him with almost indecent expectancy the skipper dropped some sugar into his coffee and stirring it in a meditative fashion sighed gently  i’ve been making a fool of myself jack he said at length i was always one to be fond of a little bit of adventure but this goes a little too far even for me  but what did you get engaged to her for enquired fraser  flower shook his head she fell violently in love with me he said mournfully she keeps the blue posts up at chelsea her father left it to her she manages her stepmother and her brother and everybody else i was just a child in her hands you know my easygoing nature  but you made love to her expostulated the mate  in a way i suppose i did admitted the other i don’t know now whether she could have me up for breach of promise because when i asked her i did it this way i said ’will you be mrs robinson’ what do you think  i should think it would make it harder for you said fraser but didn’t you remember miss banks while all this was going on  in a way said flower yes—in a way but after a man’s been engaged to a woman nine years it’s very easy to forget and every year makes it easier besides i was only a boy when i was engaged to her  twentyeight said fraser  anyway i wasn’t old enough to know my own mind said flower and my uncle and old mrs banks made it up between them they arranged everything and i can’t afford to offend the old man if i married miss tipping—that’s the blue posts girl—he’d leave his money away from me and if i marry elizabeth miss tipping’ll have me up for breach of promise—if she finds me  if you’re not very careful said fraser impressively you’ll lose both of ’em  the skipper leaned over the table and glanced carefully round just what i want to do he said in a low voice i’m engaged to another girl  what cried the mate raising his voice three  three repeated the skipper only three he added hastily as he saw a question trembling on the other’s lips  i’m ashamed of you said the latter severely you ought to know better  i don’t want any of your preaching jack said the skipper briskly and what’s more i won’t have it i deserve more pity than blame  you’ll want all you can get said fraser ominously and does the other girl know of any of the others  of either of the others—no corrected flower of course none of them know you don’t think i’m a fool do you  who is number three enquired the mate suddenly  poppy tyrell replied the other  oh said fraser trying to speak unconcernedly the girl who came here last evening  flower nodded she’s the one i’m going to marry he said colouring i’d sooner marry her than command a liner i’ll marry her if i lose every penny i’m going to have but i’m not going to lose the money if i can help it i want both  the mate baled out his cup with a spoon and put the contents into the saucer  i’m a sort of guardian to her said flower her father captain tyrell died about a year ago and i promised him i’d look after her and marry her it’s a sacred promise  besides you want to said fraser by no means in the mood to allow his superior any credit in the matter else you wouldn’t do it  you don’t know me jack said the skipper more in sorrow than in anger  no i didn’t think you were quite so bad said the mate slowly is—miss tyrell—fond of you  of course she is said flower indignantly they all are that’s the worst of it you were never much of a favourite with the sex jack were you  fraser shook his head and the saucer being full spooned the contents slowly back into the cup again  captain tyrell leave any money he enquired  other way about replied flower i lent him altogether close on a hundred pounds he was a man of very good position but he took to drink and lost his ship and his selfrespect and all he left behind was his debts and his daughter  well you’re in a tight place said fraser and i don’t see how you’re going to get out of it miss tipping’s got a bit of a clue to you now and if she once discovers you you’re done besides suppose miss tyrell finds anything out  it’s all excitement said flower cheerfully i’ve been in worse scrapes than this and always got out of ’em i don’t like a quiet life i never worry about things jack because i’ve noticed that the things people worry about never happen  well if i were you then said the other emphasizing his point with the spoon i should just worry as much as i could about it i’d get up worrying and i’d go to bed worrying i’d worry about it in my sleep  i shall come out of it all right said flower i rather enjoy it there’s gibson would marry elizabeth like a shot if she’d have him but of course she won’t look at him while i’m above ground i have thought of getting somebody to tell elizabeth a lot of lies about me  why wouldn’t the truth do enquired the mate artlessly  the skipper turned a deaf ear but she wouldn’t believe a word against me he said with mournful pride as he rose and went on deck she trusts me too much  from his knitted brows as he steered it was evident despite his confidence that this amiable weakness on the part of miss banks was causing him some anxiety a condition which was not lessened by the considerate behaviour of the mate who when any fresh complication suggested itself to him dutifully submitted it to his commander  i shall be all right said flower confidently as they entered the river the following afternoon and sailed slowly along the narrow channel which wound its sluggish way through an expanse of mudbanks to seabridge  the mate who was suffering from symptoms hitherto unknown to him made no reply his gaze wandered idly from the sloping uplands stretching away into the dim country on the starboard side to the little churchcrowned town ahead with its outlying malt houses and neglected grassgrown quay a couple of moribund ship’s boats lay rotting in the mud and the skeleton of a fishingboat completed the picture for the first time perhaps in his life the landscape struck him as dull and dreary  two men of soft and restful movements appeared on the quay as they approached and with the slowness characteristic of the best work helped to make them fast in front of the redtiled barn which served as a warehouse then captain flower after descending to the cabin to make the brief shoregoing toilet necessary for seabridge society turned to give a last word to the mate  i’m not one to care much what’s said about me jack he began by way of preface  that’s a good job for you said fraser slowly  same time let the hands know i wish ’em to keep their mouths shut pursued the skipper just tell them it was a girl that you knew and i don’t want it talked about for fear of getting you into trouble keep me out of it that’s all i ask  if cheek will pull you through said fraser with a slight display of emotion you’ll do perhaps i’d better say that miss tyrell came to see me too how would you like that  ah it would be as well said flower heartily i never thought of it  he stepped ashore and at an easy pace walked along the steep road which led to the houses above the afternoon was merging into evening and a pleasant stillness was in the air menfolk working in their cottage gardens saluted him as he passed and the occasional whiteness of a face at the back of a window indicated an interest in his affairs on the part of the fairer citizens of seabridge at the gate of the first of an ancient row of cottages conveniently situated within hail of the grapes the thorn and the swan he paused and walking up the trimkept garden path knocked at the door  it was opened by a stranger—a woman of early middle age dressed in a style to which the inhabitants of the row had long been unaccustomed the practised eye of the skipper at once classed her as rather goodlooking  captain barber’s in the garden she said smiling he wasn’t expecting you’d be up just yet  the skipper followed her in silence and after shaking hands with the short redfaced man with the grey beard and shaven lip who sat with a paper on his knee stood watching in blank astonishment as the stranger carefully filled the old man’s pipe and gave him a light their eyes meeting the uncle winked solemnly at the nephew  this is mrs church he said slowly this is my nevy cap’n fred flower  i should have known him anywhere declared mrs church the likeness is wonderful  captain barber chuckled—loudly enough for them to hear  me and mrs church have been watering the flowers he said give ’em a good watering we have  i never really knew before what a lot there was in watering admitted mrs church  there’s a right way and a wrong in doing everything said captain barber severely most people chooses the wrong if it wasn’t so those of us who have got on wouldn’t have got on  that’s very true said mrs church shaking her head  and them as haven’t got on would have got on said the philosopher following up his train of thought if you would just go out and get them things i spoke to you about mrs church we shall be all right  who is it enquired the nephew as soon as she had gone  captain barber looked stealthily round and for the second time that evening winked at his nephew  a visitor said flower  captain barber winked again and then laughed into his pipe until it gurgled  it’s a little plan o’ mine he said when he had become a little more composed she’s my housekeeper  housekeeper repeated the astonished flower  bein’ all alone here said uncle barber i think a lot i sit an’ think until i get an idea it comes quite sudden like and i wonder i never thought of it before  but what did you want a housekeeper for enquired his nephew where’s lizzie  i got rid of her said captain barber i got a housekeeper because i thought it was time you got married now do you see  no said flower shortly  captain barber laughed softly and relighting his pipe which had gone out leaned back in his chair and again winked at his indignant nephew  mrs banks he said suggestively  his nephew gazed at him blankly  captain barber sighing goodnaturedly at his dulness turned his chair a bit and explained the situation  mrs banks won’t let you and elizabeth marry till she’s gone said he  his nephew nodded  i’ve been at her ever so long said the other but she’s firm now i’m trying artfulness i’ve got a goodlooking housekeeper—she’s the pick o’ seventeen what all come here wednesday morning—and i’m making love to her  making love to her shouted his nephew gazing wildly at the venerable bald head with the smokingcap resting on one huge ear  making love to her repeated captain barber with a satisfied air what’ll happen mrs banks to prevent me getting married as she thinks will give her consent to you an’ elizabeth getting tied up  haven’t you ever heard of breach of promise cases asked his nephew aghast  there’s no fear o’ that said captain barber confidently it’s all right with mrs church she’s a widder a widder ain’t like a young girl she knows you don’t mean anything  it was useless to argue with such stupendous folly captain flower tried another tack  and suppose mrs church gets fond of you he said gravely it doesn’t seem right to trifle with a woman’s affections like that  i won’t go too far said the ladykiller in the smokingcap reassuringly  elizabeth and her mother are still away i suppose said flower after a pause  his uncle nodded  so of course you needn’t do much lovemaking till they come back said his nephew it’s waste of time isn’t it  i’ll just keep my hand in said captain barber thoughtfully i can’t say as i find it disagreeable i was always one to take a little notice of the sects  he got up to go indoors never mind about them he said as his nephew was about to follow with the chair and his tobaccojar mrs church likes to do that herself and she’d be disappointed if anybody else did it  his nephew followed him to the house in silence listening later on with a gloomy feeling of alarm to the conversation at the suppertable the rôle of gooseberry was new to him and when mrs church got up from the table for the sole purpose of proving her contention that captain barber looked better in his black velvet smokingcap than the one he was wearing he was almost on the point of exceeding his duties  he took the mate into his confidence the next day and asked him what he thought of it fraser said that it was evidently in the blood and being pressed with some heat for an explanation said that he meant captain barber’s blood  it’s bad any way i look at it said flower it may bring matters between me and elizabeth to a head or it may end in my uncle marrying the woman  very likely both said fraser cheerfully is this mrs church goodlooking  i can hardly say said flower pondering  well goodlooking enough for you to feel inclined to take any notice of her asked the mate  when you can talk seriously said the skipper in great wrath i’ll be pleased to answer you just at present i don’t feel in the sort of temper to be made fun of  he walked off in dudgeon and until they were on their way to london again treated the mate with marked coldness then the necessity of talking to somebody about his own troubles and his uncle’s idiocy put the two men on their old footing in the quietness of the cabin over a satisfying pipe he planned out in a kindly and generous spirit careers for both the ladies he was not going to marry the only thing that was wanted to complete their happiness and his was that they should fall in with the measures proposed     chapter iv     at no 5 liston street poppy tyrell sat at the open window of her room reading the outside air was pleasant despite the fact that poplar is a somewhat crowded neighbourhood and it was rendered more pleasant by comparison with the atmosphere inside which from a warm soft smell not to be described by comparison suggested washing in the stonepaved yard beneath the window a small daughter of the house hung out garments of various hues and shapes while inside in the scullery the master of the house was doing the family washing with all the secrecy and trepidation of one engaged in an unlawful task the wheeler family was a large one and the wash heavy and besides misadventures to one or two garments sorted out for further consideration the small girl was severely critical about the colour averring sharply that she was almost ashamed to put them on the line  they’ll dry clean said her father wiping his brow with the upper part of his arm the only part which was dry and if they don’t we must tell your mother that the line came down i’ll show these to her now  he took up the wet clothes and cautiously leaving the scullery crossed the passage to the parlour where mrs wheeler a confirmed invalid was lying on a ramshackle sofa darning socks mr wheeler coughed to attract her attention and with an apologetic expression of visage held up a small pink garment of the knickerbocker species and prepared for the worst  they’ve never shrunk like that said mrs wheeler starting up  they have said her husband all by itself he added in hasty selfdefence  you’ve had it in the soda said mrs wheeler disregarding  i’ve not said mr wheeler vehemently i’ve got the two tubs there flannels in one without soda the other things in the other with soda it’s bad stuff that’s what it is i thought i’d show you  it’s management they want said mrs wheeler wearily it’s the touch you have to give ’em i can’t explain but i know they wouldn’t have gone like that if i’d done ’em what’s that you’re hiding behind you  thus attacked mr wheeler produced his other hand and shaking out a blue and white shirt showed how the blue had been wandering over the white territory and how the white had apparently accepted a permanent occupation  what do you say to that he enquired desperately  you’d better ask bob what he says said his wife aghast you know how pertickler he is too i told you as plain as a woman could speak not to boil that shirt  well it can’t be helped said mr wheeler with a philosophy he hoped his son would imitate i wasn’t brought up to the washing polly  it’s a sin to spoil good things like that said mrs wheeler fretfully bob’s quite the gentleman—he will buy such expensive shirts take it away i can’t bear to look at it  mr wheeler considerably crestfallen was about to obey when he was startled by a knock at the door  that’s captain flower i expect said his wife hastily he’s going to take poppy and emma to a theatre tonight don’t let him see you in that state peter  but mr wheeler was already fumbling at the strings of his apron and despairing of undoing it broke the string and pitched it with the other clothes under the sofa and hastily donned his coat  goodevening said flower as mr wheeler opened the door this is my mate  glad to see you sir said mr wheeler  the mate made his acknowledgments and having shaken hands carefully wiped his down the leg of his trousers  moist hand you’ve got wheeler said flower who had been doing the same thing  got some dye on ’em at the docks said wheeler glibly i’ve ’ad ’em in soak  flower nodded and after a brief exchange of courtesies with mrs wheeler as he passed the door led the way up the narrow staircase to miss tyrell’s room  i’ve brought him with me so that he’ll be company for emma wheeler said the skipper as fraser shook hands with her and you must look sharp if you want to get good seats  i’m ready all but my hat and jacket said poppy and emma’s in her room getting ready too all the children are up there helping her  fraser opened his eyes at such a toilet and began secretly to wish that he had paid more attention to his own  i hope you’re not shy said miss tyrell who found his steadfast gaze somewhat embarrassing  fraser shook his head no i’m not shy he said quietly  because emma didn’t know you were coming continued miss tyrell and she’s always shy so you must be bold you know  the mate nodded as confidently as he could shyness has never been one of my failings he said nervously  further conversation was rendered difficult if not impossible by one which now took place outside it was conducted between a small wheeler on the top of the stairs and mrs wheeler in the parlour below the subject was hairpins an article in which it appeared miss wheeler was lamentably deficient owing it was suggested to a weakness of mrs wheeler’s for picking up stray ones and putting them in her hair the conversation ended in mrs wheeler whose thin voice was heard hotly combating these charges parting with six without prejudice and a few minutes later miss wheeler somewhat flushed entered the room and was introduced to the mate  all ready enquired flower as miss tyrell drew on her gloves  they went downstairs in single file the builder of the house having left no option in the matter while the small wheelers breathing hard with excitement watched them over the balusters outside the house the two ladies paired off leaving the two men to follow behind  the mate noticed with a strong sense of his own unworthiness that the two ladies seemed thoroughly engrossed in each other’s company and oblivious to all else a suggestion from flower that he should close up and take off miss wheeler seemed to him to border upon audacity but he meekly followed flower as that bold mariner ranged himself alongside the girls and taking two steps on the curb and three in the gutter walked along for some time trying to think of something to say  there ain’t room for four abreast said flower who had been scraping against the wall we’d better split up into twos  at the suggestion the ladies drifted apart and flower taking miss tyrell’s arm left the mate behind with miss wheeler nervously wondering whether he ought to do the same  i hope it won’t rain he said at last  i hope not said miss wheeler glancing up at a sky which was absolutely cloudless  so bad for ladies’ dresses continued the mate  what is enquired miss wheeler who had covered some distance since the last remark  rain said the mate quite freshly i don’t think we shall have any though  miss wheeler whose life had been passed in a neighbourhood in which there was only one explanation for such conduct concluded that he had been drinking and closing her lips tightly said no more until they reached the theatre  oh they’re going in she said quickly we shall get a bad seat  hurry up cried flower beckoning  i’ll pay whispered the mate  no i will said flower well you pay for one and i’ll pay for one then  he pushed his way to the window and bought a couple of pitstalls the mate who had not consulted him bought uppercircles and with a glance at the ladies pushed open the swingdoors  come on he said excitedly and seeing several people racing up the broad stone stairs he and miss tyrell raced with them  round this side he cried hastily as he gave up the tickets and followed by miss tyrell quickly secured a couple of seats at the end of the front row  best seats in the house almost said poppy cheerfully  where are the others said fraser looking round  coming on behind i suppose said poppy glancing over her shoulder  i’ll change places when they arrive said the other apologetically something’s detained them i should think i hope they’re not waiting for us  he stood looking about him uneasily as the seats behind rapidly filled and closely scanned their occupants and then leaving his hat on the seat walked back in perplexity to the door  never mind said miss tyrell quietly as he came back i daresay they’ll find us  fraser bought a programme and sat down the brim of miss tyrell’s hat touching his face as she bent to peruse it with her small gloved finger she pointed out the leading characters and taking no notice of his restlessness began to chat gaily about the plays she had seen until a tuning of violins from the orchestra caused her to lean forward her lips parted and her eyes beaming with anticipation  i do hope the others have got good seats she said softly as the overture finished that’s everything isn’t it  i hope so said fraser  he leaned forward excitedly not because the curtain was rising but because he had just caught sight of a figure standing up in the centre of the pitstalls he had just time to call his companion’s attention to it when the figure in deference to the threats and entreaties of the people behind sat down and was lost in the crowd  they have got good seats said miss tyrell i’m so glad what a beautiful scene  the mate stifling his misgivings gave himself up to the enjoyment of the situation which ineluded answering the breathless whispers of his neighbour when she missed a sentence and helping her to discover the identity of the characters from the programme as they appeared  i should like it all over again said miss tyrell sitting back in her seat as the curtain fell on the first act  fraser agreed with her he was closely watching the pitstalls in the general movement on the part of the audience which followed the lowering of the curtain the master of the foam was the first on his feet  i’ll go down and send him up said fraser rising  miss tyrell demurred and revealed an unsuspected timidity of character i don’t like being left here all alone she remarked wait till they see us  she spoke in the plural for miss wheeler who found the skipper exceedingly bad company had also risen and was scrutinising the house with a gaze hardly less eager than his own a suggestion of the mate that he should wave his handkerchief was promptly negatived by miss tyrell on the ground that it would not be the correct thing to do in the uppercircle and they were still undiscovered when the curtain went up for the second act and strong and willing hands from behind thrust the skipper back into his seat  i expect you’ll catch it said miss tyrell softly as the performance came to an end we’d better go down and wait for them outside i never enjoyed a piece so much  the mate rose and mingled with the crowd conscious of a little occasional clutch at his sleeve whenever other people threatened to come between them outside the crowd dispersed slowly and it was some minutes before they discovered a small but compact knot of two waiting for them  where the— began flower  i hope you enjoyed the performance captain flower said miss tyrell drawing herself up with some dignity i didn’t know that i was supposed to look out for myself all the evening if it hadn’t been for mr fraser i should have been all alone  she looked hard at miss wheeler as she spoke and the couple from the pitstalls reddened with indignation at being so misunderstood  i’m sure i didn’t want him said miss wheeler hastily two or three times i thought there would have been a fight with the people behind  oh it doesn’t matter said miss tyrell composedly well it’s no good standing here we’d better get home  she walked off with the mate leaving the couple behind who realised that appearances were against them to follow at their leisure conversation was mostly on her side the mate being too much occupied with his defence to make any very long or very coherent replies  they reached liston street at last and separated at the door miss tyrell shaking hands with the skipper in a way which conveyed in the fullest possible manner her opinion of his behaviour that evening a bright smile and a genial handshake were reserved for the mate  and now said the incensed skipper breathing deeply as the door closed and they walked up liston street what the deuce do you mean by it  mean by what demanded the mate who after much thought had decided to take a leaf out of miss tyrell’s book  mean by leaving me in another part of the house with that wheeler girl while you and my intended went off together growled flower ferociously  well i could only think you wanted it said fraser in a firm voice  what demanded the other hardly able to believe his ears  i thought you wanted miss wheeler for number four said the mate calmly you know what a chap you are cap’n  his companion stopped and regarded him in speechless amaze then realising a vocabulary to which miss wheeler had acted as a safetyvalve all the evening he turned up a side street and stamped his way back to the foam alone     chapter v     the same day that flower and his friends visited the theatre captain barber gave a small and select teaparty the astonished mrs banks had returned home with her daughter the day before to find the air full of rumours about captain barber and his new housekeeper they had been watched for hours at a time from upper back windows of houses in the same row and the professional opinion of the entire female element was that mrs church could land her fish at any time she thought fit  old fools are the worst of fools said mrs banks tersely as she tied her bonnet strings the idea of captain barber thinking of marrying at his time of life  why shouldn’t he enquired her daughter  why because he’s promised to leave his property to fred and you of course snapped the old lady if he marries that hussy it’s precious little you and fred will get  i expect it’s mostly talk said her daughter calmly as she closed the street door behind her indignant parent people used to talk about you and old mr wilders and there was nothing in it he only used to come for a glass of your ale  this reference to an admirer who had consumed several barrels of the liquor in question without losing his head put the finishing touch to the elder lady’s wrath and she walked the rest of the way in ominous silence  captain barber received them in the elaborate velvet smokingcap with the gold tassel which had evoked such strong encomiums from mrs church and in a few wellchosen words—carefully rehearsed that afternoon—presented his housekeeper  will you come up to my room and take your things off enquired mrs church returning the old lady’s hostile stare with interest  i’ll take mine off down here if captain barber doesn’t mind said the latter subsiding into a chair with a gasp him and me’s very old friends  she unfastened the strings of her bonnet and taking off that article of attire placed it in her lap while she unfastened her shawl she then held both out to mrs church briefly exhorting her to be careful  oh what a lovely bonnet said that lady in false ecstasy what a perfect beauty i’ve never seen anything like it before never  captain barber smiling at the politeness of his housekeeper was alarmed and perplexed at the generous colour which suddenly filled the old lady’s cheeks  mrs banks made it herself he said she’s very clever at that sort of thing  there do you know i guessed as much said mrs church beaming directly i saw it i said to myself ’that was never made by a milliner there’s too much taste in the way the flowers are arranged’  mrs banks looked at her daughter in a mute appeal for help  i’ll take yours up too shall i said the amiable housekeeper as mrs banks with an air of defying criticism drew a cap from a paperbag and put it on  i’ll take mine myself please said miss banks with coldness  oh well you may as well take them all then said mrs church putting the mother’s bonnet and shawl in her arms i’ll go and see that the kettle boils she said briskly  she returned a minute or two later with the teapot and setting chairs took the head of the table  and how’s the leg enquired captain barber misinterpreting mrs banks’ screwedup face  which one asked mrs banks shortly  the bad ’un said the captain  they’re both bad said mrs banks more shortly than before as she noticed that mrs church had got real lace in her cuffs and was pouring out the tea in full consciousness of the fact  dear dear said the captain sympathetically  swollen enquired mrs church anxiously  swelled right out of shape exclaimed captain barber impressively like pillars almost they are  poor thing said mrs church in a voice which made mrs banks itch to slap her i knew a lady once just the same but she was a drinking woman  again mrs banks at a loss for words looked at her daughter for assistance  dear me how dreadful it must be to know such people said mrs banks shivering  yes sighed the other it used to make me feel sorry for her—they were utterly shapeless you know horrid  that’s how mrs banks’ are said the captain nodding sagely you look ’ot mrs banks shall i open the winder a bit  i’ll thank you not to talk about me like that captain barber said mrs banks the flowers on her hat trembling  as you please ma’am said captain barber with a stateliness which deserved a better subject i was only repeating what dr hodder told me in your presence  mrs banks made no reply but created a diversion by passing her cup up for more tea her feelings when mrs church took off the lid of the teapot and poured in about a pint of water before helping her belonging to that kind known as indescribable  water bewitched and tea begrudged she said trying to speak jocularly  well the fourth cup never is very good is it said mrs church apologetically i’ll put some more tea in so that your next cup’ll be better  as a matter of fact it was mrs banks’ third cup and she said so mrs church receiving the correction with a polite smile more than tinged with incredulity  it’s wonderful what a lot of tea is drunk said captain barber impressively looking round the table  i’ve heard say it’s like spirit drinking said mrs church they say it gets such a hold of people that they can’t give it up they’re just slaves to it and they like it brown and strong like brandy  mrs banks who had been making noble efforts could contain herself no longer she put down the harmless beverage which had just been handed to her and pushed her chair back from the table  are you speaking of me young woman she asked tremulous with indignation  oh no certainly not said mrs church in great distress i never thought of such a thing i was alluding to the people captain barber was talking of—regular teadrinkers you know  i know what you mean ma’am said mrs banks fiercely  there there said captain barber illadvisedly  don’t you say ’there there’ to me captain barber because i won’t have it said the old lady speaking with great rapidity if you think that i’m going to sit here and be insulted by—by that woman you’re mistaken  you’re quite mistook mrs banks said the captain slowly i’ve heard everything she said and where the insult comes in i’m sure i don’t know i don’t think i’m wanting in common sense ma’am  he patted the housekeeper’s hand kindly and in full view of the indignant mrs banks she squeezed his in return and gazed at him affectionately there is nothing humourous to the ordinary person in a teacup but mrs banks looking straight into hers broke into a short derisive laugh  anything the matter ma’am enquired captain barber regarding her somewhat severely  mrs banks shook her head only thoughts she said mysteriously  it is difficult for a man to object to his visitors finding amusement in their thoughts or even to enquire too closely into the nature of them mrs banks apparently realising this laughed again with increased acridity and finally became so very amused that she shook in her chair  i’m glad you’re enjoying yourself ma’am said captain barber loftily  with a view perhaps of giving his guest further amusement he patted the housekeeper’s hand again whereupon mrs banks’ laughter ceased and she sat regarding mrs church with a petrified stare met by that lady with a glance of haughty disdain  s’pose we go into the garden a bit suggested barber uneasily the two ladies had eyed each other for three minutes without blinking and his own eyes were watering in sympathy  mrs banks secretly glad of the interruption made one or two vague remarks about going home but after much persuasion allowed him to lead her into the garden the solemn elizabeth bringing up in the rear with a hassock and a couple of cushions  it’s a new thing for you having a housekeeper observed mrs banks after her daughter had returned to the house to assist in washing up  yes i wonder i never thought of it before said the artful barber you wouldn’t believe how comfortable it is  i daresay said mrs banks grimly  it’s nice to have a woman about the house continued captain barber slowly it makes it more homelike a slip of a servantgal ain’t no good at all  how does fred like it enquired mrs banks  my ideas are fred’s ideas said uncle barber somewhat sharply what i like he has to like naturally  i was thinking of my darter said mrs banks smoothing down her apron majestically the arrangement was i think that when they were married they was to live with you  captain barber nodded acquiescence  elizabeth would never live in a house with that woman or any other woman as housekeeper in it said the mother  well she won’t have to said the old man when they marry and elizabeth comes here i sha’n’t want a housekeeper—i shall get rid of her  mrs banks shifted in her chair and gazed thoughtfully down the garden of course my idea was for them to wait till i was gone she said at length  just so replied the other and more’s the pity  but elizabeth’s getting on and i don’t seem to go continued the old lady as though mildly surprised at providence for its unaccountable delay and there’s fred he ain’t getting younger  captain barber puffed at his pipe none of us are he said profoundly  and fred might get tired of waiting said mrs banks ruminating  he’d better let me hear him said the uncle fiercely leastways o’ course he’s tired o’ waiting in a sense he’d like to be married  there’s young gibson said mrs banks in a thrilling whisper  what about him enquired barber surprised at her manner  comes round after elizabeth said mrs banks  no said captain barber blankly  mrs banks pursed up her lips and nodded darkly  pretends to come and see me said mrs banks always coming in bringing something new for my legs the worst of it is he ain’t always careful what he brings he brought some newfangled stuff in a bottle last week and the agonies i suffered after rubbing it in wouldn’t be believed  it’s like his impudence said the captain  i’ve been thinking said mrs banks nodding her head with some animation of giving fred a little surprise what do you think he’d do if i said they might marry this autumn  jump out of his skin with joy said captain barber with conviction mrs banks the pleasure you’ve given me this day is more than i can say  and they’ll live with you just the same said mrs banks  certainly said the captain  they’ll only be a few doors off then said mrs banks and it’ll be nice for you to have a woman in the house to look after you  captain barber nodded softly it’s what i’ve been wanting for years he said heartily  and that huss—husskeeper said mrs banks correcting herself—will go  o’ course said captain barber i sha’n’t want no housekeeper with my nevy’s wife in the house you’ve told elizabeth i s’pose  not yet said mrs banks who as a matter of fact had been influenced by the proceedings of that afternoon to bring to a head a step she had hitherto only vaguely contemplated  elizabeth who came down the garden again a little later accompanied by mrs church received the news stolidly a feeling of regret that the attention of the devoted gibson must now cease certainly occurred to her but she never thought of contesting the arrangements made for her and accepted the situation with a placidity which the more ardent barber was utterly unable to understand  fred’ll stand on his’ed with joy the unsophisticated mariner declared with enthusiasm  he’ll go singing about the house declared mrs church  mrs banks regarded her unfavourably  he’s never said much continued uncle barber in an exalted strain that ain’t fred’s way he takes arter me he’s one o’ the quiet ones one o’ the still deep waters what always feels the most when i tell ’im his face’ll just light up with joy  it’ll be nice for you too said mrs banks with a side glance at the housekeeper you’ll have somebody to look after you and take an interest in you and strangers can’t be expected to do that even if they’re nice  we shall have him standing on his head too said mrs church with a bright smile you’re turning everything upside down mrs banks  there’s things as wants altering said the old lady with emphasis there’s few things as i don’t see ma’am  i hope you’ll live to see a lot more said mrs church piously  she’ll live to be ninety said captain barber heartily  oh easily said mrs church  captain barber regarding his old friend saw her face suffused with a wrath for which he was utterly unable to account with a hazy idea that something had passed which he had not heard he caused a diversion by sending mrs church indoors for a pack of cards and solemnly celebrated the occasion with a game of whist at which mrs church in partnership with mrs banks either through sheer wilfulness or absence of mind contrived to lose every game     chapter vi     as a result of the mate’s illbehaviour at the theatre captain fred flower treated him with an air of chilly disdain ignoring as far as circumstances would permit the fact that such a person existed so far as the social side went the mate made no demur but it was a different matter when the skipper acted as though he were not present at the breakfast table and being chary of interfering with the other’s selfimposed vow of silence he rescued a couple of rashers from his plate and put them on his own also in order to put matters on a more equal footing he drank three cups of coffee in rapid succession leaving the skipper to his own reflections and an empty coffeepot in this sociable fashion they got through most of the day the skipper refraining from speech until late in the afternoon when both being at work in the hold the mate let a heavy case fall on his foot  i thought you’d get it he said calmly as flower paused to take breath it wasn’t my fault  whose was it then roared flower who had got his boot off and was trying various tender experiments with his toe to see whether it was broken or not  if you hadn’t been holding your head in the air and pretending that i wasn’t here it wouldn’t have happened said fraser with some heat  the skipper turned his back on him and meeting a look of enquiring solicitude from joe applied to him for advice  what had i better do with it he asked  well if it was my toe sir said joe regarding it respectfully i should stick it in a basin o’ boiling water and keep it there as long as i could bear it  you’re a fool said the skipper briefly what do you think of it ben i don’t think it’s broken  the old seaman scratched his head well if it belonged to me he said slowly there’s some ointment down the fo’c’s’le which the cook ’ad for sore eyes i should just put some o’ that on it looks good stuff  the skipper summarising the chief points in ben’s character which owing principally to the poverty of the english language bore a remarkable likeness to joe’s and the mate’s took his sock and boot in his hand and gaining the deck limped painfully to the cabin  the foot was so painful after tea that he could hardly bear his slipper on and he went ashore in his working clothes to the chemist’s preparatory to fitting himself out for liston street the chemist leaning over the counter was inclined to take a serious view of it and shaking his head with much solemnity prepared a bottle of medicine a bottle of lotion and a box of ointment  let me see it again as soon as you’ve finished the medicine he said as he handed the articles over the counter  flower promised and hobbling towards the door turned into the street then the amiable air which he had worn in the shop gave way to one of unseemly hauteur as he saw fraser hurrying towards him  look out cried the latter warningly  the skipper favoured him with a baleful stare  all right said the mate angrily go your own way then don’t come to me when you get into trouble that’s all  flower passed on his way in silence then a thought struck him and he stopped suddenly  you wish to speak to me he asked stiffly  no i’m damned if i do said the mate sticking his hands into his pockets  if you wish to speak to me said the other trying in vain to conceal a trace of anxiety in his voice it’s my duty to listen what were you going to say just now  the mate eyed him wrathfully but as the pathetic figure with its wounded toe and cargo of remedies stood there waiting for him to speak he suddenly softened  don’t go back old man he said kindly she’s aboard  eighteen pennyworth of mixture to be taken thrice daily from tablespoons spilled over the curb and the skipper thrusting the other packets mechanically into his pockets disappeared hurriedly around the corner  it’s no use finding fault with me said fraser quickly as he stepped along beside him so don’t try it they came down into the cabin before i knew they were aboard even  they repeated the distressed flower who’s they  the young woman that came before and a stout woman with a little dark moustache and earrings they’re going to wait until you come back to ask you a few questions about mr robinson they’ve been asking me a few i’ve locked the door of your stateroom and here’s the key  flower pocketed it and after a little deliberation thanked him  i did the best i could for you said the other with a touch of severity if i’d treated you as some men would have done i should have just let you walk straight into the trap  flower gave an apologetic cough i’ve had a lot of worry lately jack he said humbly come in and have something perhaps it will clear my head a bit  i told ’em you wouldn’t be back till twelve at least said the mate as flower rapidly diagnosed his complaint and ordered whisky perhaps not then and that when you did turn up you’d sure to be the worse for liquor the old lady said she’d wait all night for the pleasure of seeing your bonny face and as for you being drunk she said she don’t suppose there’s a woman in london that has had more experience with drunken men than she has  let this be a warning to you jack said the skipper solemnly as he drained his glass and put it thoughtfully on the counter  don’t you trouble about me said fraser you’ve got all you can do to look after yourself i’ve come out to look for a policeman at least that’s what i told them  all the police in the world couldn’t do me any good sighed flower poppy’s got tickets for a concert tonight and i was going with her i can’t go like this  well what are you going to do enquired the other  flower shook his head and pondered you go back and get rid of them the best way you can he said at length but whatever you do don’t have a scene i’ll stay here till you come and tell me the coast is clear  and suppose it don’t clear said fraser  then i’ll pick you up at greenwich in the morning said flower  and suppose they’re still aboard said fraser  i won’t suppose any such thing said the other hotly if you can’t get rid of two women between now and three in the morning you’re not much of a mate if they catch me i’m ruined and you’ll be responsible for it  the mate staring at him blankly opened his mouth to reply but being utterly unable to think of anything adequate to the occasion took up his glass instead and drinking off the contents turned to the door he stood for a moment at the threshold gazing at flower as though he had just discovered points about him which had hitherto escaped his notice and then made his way back to the wharf  they’re still down below sir said joe softly as he stepped aboard and making as free and as comfortable as though they’re going to stay a month  fraser shrugged his shoulders and went below the appearance of the ladies amply confirmed joe’s remark  never can find one when you want him can you said the elder lady in playful allusion to the police  well i altered my mind said fraser amiably i don’t like treating ladies roughly but if the cap’n comes on board and finds you here it’ll be bad for me that’s all  what time do you expect him enquired miss tipping  not before we sail at three in the morning said the mate glibly perhaps not then i often have to take the ship out without him he’s been away six weeks at a stretch before now  well we’ll stay here till he does come said the elder lady i’ll have his cabin and my stepdaughter’ll have to put up with your bed  if you’re not gone by the time we start i shall have to have you put off said fraser  those of us who live longest’ll see the most said mrs tipping calmly  an hour or two passed the mate sitting smoking with a philosophy which he hoped the waiting mariner at the admiral cochrane would be able to imitate he lit the lamp at last and going on deck ordered the cook to prepare supper  mother and daughter with feelings of gratitude against which they fought strongly noticed that the table was laid for three and a little later in a somewhat awkward fashion they all sat down to the meal together  very good beef said mrs tipping politely  very nice said her daughter who was exchanging glances with the mate i suppose you’re very comfortable here mr fraser  the mate sighed it’s all right when the old man’s away he said deceitfully he’s got a dreadful temper  i hope you didn’t get into trouble through my coming aboard the other night said miss tipping softly  don’t say anything about it replied the mate eyeing her admiringly i’d do more than that for you if i could  miss tipping catching her mother’s eye bestowed upon her a glance of complacent triumph  you don’t mind us coming down here do you she said languishingly  i wish you’d live here said the unscrupulous fraser but of course i know you only come here to try and see that fellow robinson he added gloomily  i like to see you too was the reply i like you very much as a friend  the mate in a melancholy voice thanked her and to the great annoyance of the cook who had received strict orders from the forecastle to listen as much as he could sat in silence while the table was cleared  what do you say to a hand at cards he said after the cook had finally left the cabin  threehanded cribbage said mrs tipping quickly it’s the only game worth playing  no objection being raised the masterful lady drew closer to the table and concentrating energies of no mean order on the game successfully played hands of unvarying goodness aided by a method of pegging which might perhaps be best described as dot and carry one  you haven’t seen anything of this mr robinson since you were here last i suppose said fraser noting with satisfaction that both ladies gave occasional uneasy glances at the clock  no an’ not likely to said mrs tipping fifteen two fifteen four fifteen six and a pair’s eight  where’s the fifteen six enquired fraser glancing oven  eight and seven said the lady pitching the cards with the others and beginning to shuffle for the next deal  it’s very strange behaviour said the mate robinson i mean do you think he’s dead  no i don’t said mrs tipping briefly where’s that captain of yours  fraser whose anxiety was becoming too much for his play leaned over the table as though about to speak and then apparently thinking better of it went on with the game  eh said mrs tipping putting her cards face downwards on the table and catching his eye where  o nowhere said fraser awkwardly i don’t want to be dragged into this you know it isn’t my business  if you know where he is why can’t you tell us asked mrs tipping softly there’s no harm in that  what’s the good enquired fraser in a low voice when you’ve seen the old man you won’t be any forwarder—he wouldn’t tell you anything even if he knew it  well we’d like to see him said mrs tipping after a pause  you see you put me in a difficulty said fraser if the skipper doesn’t come aboard you’re going with us i understand  mrs tipping nodded exactly she said sharply  that’ll get me into trouble if anything will said the mate gloomily on the other hand if i tell you where he is now that’ll get me into trouble too  he sat back and drummed on the table with his fingers well i’ll risk it he said at length you’ll find him at 17 beaufort street bow  the younger woman sprang excitedly to her feet but mrs tipping eyeing the young man with a pair of shrewd small eyes kept her seat  and while we’re going how do we know the capt’n won’t come back and go off with the ship she enquired  fraser hesitated well i’ll come with you if you like he said slowly  and suppose they go away and leave you behind objected mrs tipping  oh well you’d better stay then said the mate wearily unless we take a couple of the hands with us how would that suit you they can’t sail with half a crew  mrs tipping who was by no means as anxious for a sea voyage as she tried to make out carefully pondered the situation i’m going to take an arm of each of ’em and matilda’ll take yours she said at length  as you please said fraser and in this way the procession actually started up the wharf and looking back indignantly over its shoulder saw the watchman and ben giving way to the most unseemly mirth while the cook capered joyously behind them a belated cab was passing the gate as they reached it and in response to the mate’s hail pulled sharply up  mrs tipping pushing her captives in first stepped heavily into the cab followed by her daughter while the mate after a brief discussion clambered onto the box  go on he said nodding  wot ain’t the rest of you comin’ enquired the cabman eyeing the crowd at the gate in pained surprise  no 17 beaufort street bow said mrs tipping distinctly as she put her head out of the window  you could sit on ’er lap continued the cabman appealingly  no reply being vouchsafed to this suggestion he wrapped himself up in various rugs and then sat down suddenly before they could unwind themselves then with a compassionate click to his horse started up the road except for a few chance wayfarers and an occasional coffeestall the main streets were deserted but they were noisy compared with beaufort street every house was in absolute darkness as the cab with instinctive deference to slumber crawled slowly up and down looking for no 17  it stopped at last and the mate springing down opened the door and handing out the ladies led the way up a flight of steps to the street door  perhaps you won’t mind knocking he said to mrs tipping and don’t forget to tell the cap’n i’ve done this to oblige you because you insisted upon it  mrs tipping seizing the knocker knocked loud and long and after a short interval repeated the performance somebody was heard stirring upstairs and a deep voice cried out that it was coming and peremptorily requested them to cease knocking  that’s not flower’s voice said fraser  not loud enough said miss tipping  the bolts were drawn back loudly and the chain grated then the door was flung open and a big redwhiskered man blinking behind a candle gruffly enquired what they meant by it  come inside said mrs tipping to her following  ain’t you come to the wrong house demanded the redwhiskered man borne slowly back by numbers  i don’t think so said mrs tipping suavely i want to see captain flower  well you’ve come to the wrong house said the redwhiskered man shortly there’s no such name here  think said mrs tipping  the redwhiskered man waved the candle to and fro until the passage was flecked with tallow  go away directly he roared how dare you come disturbing people like this  you may just as well be pleasant over it said mrs tipping severely because we sha’n’t go away until we have seen him after all it’s got nothing to do with you  we don’t want anything to say to you affirmed her daughter  will—you—get—out—of—my—house demanded the owner wildly  when we’ve seen capt’n flower said mrs tipping calmly and not a moment before we don’t mind your getting in a temper not a bit you can’t frighten us  the frenzied and reckless reply of the redwhiskered man was drowned in the violent slamming of the streetdoor and he found himself alone with the ladies there was a yell of triumph outside and the sounds of a hurried scramble down the steps mrs tipping fumbling wildly at the catch of the door opened it just in time to see the cabman in reply to the urgent entreaties of the mate frantically lashing his horse up the road  so far so good murmured the mate as he glanced over his shoulder at the little group posing on the steps i’ve done the best i could but i suppose there’ll be a row  the watchman with the remainder of the crew in various attitudes of expectant curiosity were waiting to receive them at the wharf a curiosity which increased in intensity as the mate slamming the gate put the big bar across and turned to the watchman  don’t open that to anybody till we’re off he said sharply cap’n flower has not turned up yet i suppose  no sir said ben  they went aboard the schooner again and the mate remaining on deck listened anxiously for the return of the redoubtable mrs tipping occasionally glancing over the side in expectation of being boarded from the neighbouring stairs but with the exception of a false alarm caused by two maddened seamen unable to obtain admittance and preferring insulting charges of somnolency against the watchman the time passed quietly until high water with the schooner in midstream slowly picking her way through the traffic any twinges of remorse that he might have had for the way he had treated two helpless women left him and he began to feel with his absent commander some of the charm which springs from successful wrongdoing     chapter vii     he brought up off greenwich in the cold grey of the breaking day craft of all shapes and sizes were passing up and down but he looked in vain for any sign of the skipper it was galling to him as a seaman to stay there with the wind blowing freshly down the river but over an hour elapsed before a yell from tim who was leaning over the bows called his attention to a waterman’s skiff in the stern of which sat a passenger of somewhat dejected appearance he had the air of a man who had been up all night and in place of returning the hearty and significant greeting of the mate sat down in an exhausted fashion on the cabin skylight and eyed him in stony silence until they were under way again  well he said at length ungraciously  chilled by his manner fraser in place of the dramatic fashion in which he had intended to relate the events of the preceding night told him in a few curt sentences what had occurred and you can finish this business for yourself he concluded warmly i’ve had enough of it  you’ve made a pretty mess of it groaned the other there’ll be a fine setout now why couldn’t you coax ’em away that’s what i wanted you to do that’s what i told you to do  well you’ll have plenty of opportunities of coaxing yourself so far as i can see retorted fraser grimly then you’ll see how it works it was the only way of getting rid of them  you ought to have sent round to me and let me know what you were doing said flower i sat in that blamed pub till they turned me out at twelve expecting you every minute i’d only threepence left by then and i crossed the water with that and then i had to shuffle along to greenwich as best i could with a bad foot what’ll be the end of it all i don’t know  well you’re all right at present said fraser glancing round rather different to what you’d have been if those two women had come to ipswich and seen cap’n barber  the other sat for a long time in thought i’ll lay up for a few weeks with this foot he said slowly and you’ll have to tell the tipping family that i’ve changed into another trade what with the worry i’ve had lately i shall be glad of a rest  he made his way below and turning in slept soundly after his fatigue until the cook aroused him a few hours later with the information that breakfast was ready  a wash and a change together with a good breakfast effected as much change in his spirits as in his appearance refreshed in mind and body he slowly paced the deck his chest expanding as he sniffed the fresh air and his soul encouraged by the dangers he had already passed through bracing itself for fresh encounters  i ’ope the foot is goin’ on well sir said tim breaking in upon his meditations respectfully  much easier this morning said the skipper amiably  tim who was lending the cook a hand went back into the galley to ponder as a result of a heated debate in the fo’c’s’le where the last night’s proceedings and the mysterious appearance of the skipper off greenwich had caused a great sensation they had drawn lots to decide who was to bell the cat and tim had won or lost according as the subject might be viewed  you don’t want to walk about on it much sir he said thrusting his head out again  the skipper nodded  i was alarmed last night said tim we was all alarmed he added hastily in order that the others might stand in with the risk thinking that perhaps you’d walked too far and couldn’t get back  the master of the foam looked at him but made no reply and tim’s head was slowly withdrawn the crew who had been gazing over the side with their ears at the utmost tension gave him five minutes’ grace and then the skipper having gone aft again walked up to the galley  i’ve done all i could said the wretched youth  done all ye could said joe derisively why you ain’t done nothin’ yet  i can’t say anything more said tim i dassent i ain’t got your pluck joe  pluck be damned said the seaman fiercely why there was a chap i knew once shipwrecked he was and had to take to the boats when the grub give out they drew lots to see who should be killed and eaten he lost did ’e back out of it not a bit of it ’e was a man an’ ’e shook ’ands with ’em afore they ate ’im and wished ’em luck  well you can kill and eat me if that’s what you want said tim desperately i’d sooner ’ave that  mind you said joe till you’ve arsked them questions and been answered satisfactorily—none of us’ll ’ave anything to do with you besides which i’ll give you such a licking as you’ve never ’ad before  he strolled off with ben and the cook as the skipper came towards them again and sat down in the bows tim sore afraid of his shipmates’ con tempt tried again  i wanted to ask your pardon in case i done wrong last night sir he said humbly  all right it’s granted replied the other walking away  tim raised his eyes to heaven and then lowering them looked even more beseechingly at his comrades  go on said ben shaping the words only with his mouth  i don’t know sir whether you know what i was alloodin’ to just now said tim in trembling accents as the skipper came within earshot again i’m areferring to a cab ride  and i told you that i’ve forgiven you said flower sternly forgiven you freely—all of you  it’s a relief to my mind sir faltered the youth staring  don’t mix yourself up in my business again that’s all said the skipper you mightn’t get off so easy next time  it’s been worrying me ever since sir persisted tim who was half fainting i’ve been wondering whether i ought to have answered them ladies’ questions and told ’em what i did tell ’em  the skipper swung round hastily and confronted him told them he stuttered told them what  i ’ardly remember sir said tim alarmed at his manner wot with the suddenness o’ the thing an’ the luckshury o’ riding in a cab my ’ead was in a whirl  what did they ask you demanded the shipper  they asked me what cap’n flower was like an’ where ’e lived said tim an’ they asked me whether i knew a mr robinson  captain flower his eyes blazing waited  i said i ’adn’t got the pleasure o’ mr robinson’s acquaintance said tim with a grand air i was just goin’ to tell ’em about you when joe ’ere gave me a pinch  well enquired the skipper stamping with impatience  i pinched ’im back agin said tim smiling tenderly at the reminiscence  tim’s a fool sir said joe suddenly as the overwrought skipper made a move towards the galley ’e didn’t seem to know wot ’e was a sayin’ of so i up and told ’em all about you  you did did you damn you said flower bitterly  in answer to their questions sir said joe i told ’em you was a baldheaded chap marked with the smallpox and i said when you was at ’ome which was seldom you lived at aberdeen  the skipper stepped towards him and laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder you ought to have been an admiral joe he said gratefully without intending any slur on a noble profession  i also told george the watchman to tell ’em the same thing if they came round again worrying said joe proudly  the skipper patted him on the shoulder again  one o’ these days joe he remarked you shall know all about this little affair for the present it’s enough to tell you that a certain unfortunate young female has took a fancy to a friend o’ mine named robinson but it’s very important for robinson’s sake that she shouldn’t see me or get to know anything about me do you understand  perfectly said joe sagely  his countenance was calm and composed but the cook’s forehead had wrinkled itself into his hair in a strong brain effort while ben was looking for light on the deck and not finding it flower as a sign that the conversation was now ended walked aft again and taking the wheel from the mate thoughtfully suggested that he should go below and turn in for five minutes  i’ll get through this all right after all he said comfortably i’ll lay up at seabridge for a week or two and after that i’ll get off the schooner at greenwich for a bit and let you take her up to london then i’ll write a letter in the name of robinson and send it to a man i know in new york to post from there to miss tipping  his spirits rose and he slapped fraser heartily on the back that disposes of one he said cheerily lor’ in years to come how i shall look back and laugh over all this  yes i think it’ll be some time before you do any laughing to speak of said fraser  ah you always look on the dark side of things said flower briskly  of course as things are you’re going to marry miss banks said fraser slowly  no i’m not said the other cheerfully it strikes me there’s plenty of time before that will come to a head and that gives me time to turn round i don’t think she’s any more anxious for it than i am  but suppose it does come to a head persisted fraser what are you going to do  i shall find a way out of it said the skipper confidently meantime just as an exercise for your wits you might try and puzzle out what would be the best thing to do in such a case  his good spirits lasted all the way to seabridge and the schooner berthed he went cheerfully off home it was early afternoon when he arrived and captain barber being out he had a comfortable tête à tête with mrs church in which he was able to dilate pretty largely upon the injury to his foot captain barber did not return until the tea was set and then shaking hands with his nephew took a seat opposite and in a manner more than unusually boisterous kept up a long conversation  it was a matter of surprise to flower that though the talk was by no means of a sorrowful nature mrs church on three separate occasions rose from the table and left the room with her handkerchief to her eyes at such times his uncle’s ideas forsook him and he broke off not only in the middle of a sentence but even in the middle of a word at the third time flower caught his eye and with a dumb jerk of his head toward the door enquired what it all meant  tell you presently said his uncle in a frightened whisper hush don’t take no notice of it not a word  what is it persisted flower  captain barber gave a hurried glance towards the door and then leaned over the table broken ’art he whispered sorrowfully  flower whistled and full of the visions which this communication opened up neglected to join in the artificial mirth which his uncle was endeavouring to provoke upon the housekeeper’s return finally he worked up a little mirth on his own account and after glancing from his uncle to the housekeeper and from the housekeeper back to his uncle again smothered his face in his handkerchief and rushed from the room  bit on a bad tooth he said untruthfully when he came back  captain barber eyed him fiercely but mrs church regarded him with compassionate interest and having got the conversation upon such a safe subject kept it there until the meal was finished  what’s it all about enquired flower as tea finished captain barber carried his chair to the extreme end of the garden and beckoned his nephew to do likewise  you’re the cause of it said captain barber severely  me said flower in surprise  you know that little plan i told you of when you was down here said the other  his nephew nodded  it came off groaned captain barber i’ve got news for you as’ll make you dance for joy  i’ve got a bad foot said flower paling  never mind about your foot said his uncle regarding him fixedly your banns are up  up up where gasped flower  why—in the church said the other staring at him where do you think i got the old lady’s consent day before yesterday and had ’em put up at once  is she dead then enquired his nephew in a voice the hollowness of which befitted the question  how the devil could she be returned his uncle staring at him  no i didn’t think of that said flower of course she couldn’t give her consent could she—not if she was dead i mean  captain barber drew his chair back and looked at him his joy has turned his brain he said with conviction  no it’s my foot said flower rallying i’ve had no sleep with it i’m delighted delighted after all these years  you owe it to me said his uncle with a satisfied air i generally see my way clear to what i want and generally get it too i’ve played mrs banks and mrs church agin one another without their knowing it both ’elpless in my hands they was  but what’s the matter with mrs church said his depressed nephew  oh that’s the worst of it said uncle barber shaking his head while i was in play that pore woman must have thought i was in earnest she don’t say nothing not a word and the efforts she makes to control her feelings is noble  have you told her she has got to go then enquired flower  captain barber shook his head mrs banks saved me that trouble he said grimly  but she can’t take notice from mrs banks said flower it’ll have to come from you  all in good time said captain barber wiping his face as i’ve done all this for you i was going to let you tell her  me said flower with emphasis  certainly said captain barber with more emphasis still just get her to yourself on the quiet and allude to it casual then after that bring the subject up when i’m in the room as it’s to make room for you and your wife you might fix the date for ’er to go that’ll be the best way to do it  it seems to me it is rather hard on her said his nephew compassionately perhaps we had better wait a little longer  certainly not said captain barber sharply don’t i tell you your banns are up you’re to be asked in church first time next sunday you’ll both live with me as agreed and i’m going to make over three o’ the cottages to you and a halfshare in the ship the rest you’ll have to wait for why don’t you look cheerful you ought to  i’m cheerful enough said flower recovering himself i’m thinking of you  me said his uncle  you and mrs church said his nephew so far as i can see you’ve committed yourself  i can manage said uncle barber i’ve always been master in my own house now you’d better step round and see the bride that is to be  well you be careful said his nephew warningly  i’m coming too said captain barber with some haste there’s no need to stay and wait for trouble when you go into the house come back as though you’d forgotten something and sing out to me that you want me to come too—hard enough for ’er to hear mind     chapter viii     the bewildered master of the foam spent the remainder of the time at seabridge in a species of waking nightmare  a greyhaired dressmaker and a small apprentice sat in the banks’ best parlour and from a chaos of brown paper patterns stuck over with pins a silk dress of surpassing beauty began slowly to emerge as a great concession flower was allowed to feel the material and even to rub it between his finger and thumb in imitation of captain barber who was so prone to the exercise that a small piece was cut for his especial delectation a colour of unwonted softness glowed in the cheek of elizabeth and an air of engaging timidity tempered her interview with flower who had to run the gauntlet of much friendly criticism on the part of his fair neighbours  up to the time of sailing for london again the allusion to mrs church’s departure desired by captain barber had not been made by the younger man the housekeeper was still in possession and shook hands with him at the front door as he limped slowly off with miss banks and his uncle to go down to the schooner his foot was still very bad so bad that he stumbled three times on the way to the quay despite the assistance afforded by the arm of his betrothed  seems to be no power in it he said smiling faintly but i daresay it’ll be all right by the time i get back  he shook hands with captain barber and as a tribute to conventionality kissed miss banks the last the two saw of him he was standing at the wheel waving his handkerchief they waved their own in return and as the foam drew rapidly away gave a final farewell and departed  what’s the game with the foot enquired the mate in a low voice  tell you byandby said the skipper it’s far from well but even if it wasn’t i should pretend it was bad i suppose that doesn’t suggest anything to you  the mate shook his head  can you see any way out of it enquired the other what would you do if you were in my place  marry the girl i wanted to marry said the mate sturdily and not trouble about anything else  and lose thirteen cottages and this ship and my berth in the bargain said the skipper now you try and think of some other way and if you haven’t thought of it by dinnertime i’ll tell you what i’m going to do  no other scheme having suggested itself to the mate by the time that meal arrived he prepared to play the part of listener the skipper after carefully closing both the door and the skylight prepared to speak  i’m in a desperate fix jack that you’ll admit he said by way of preparation  the mate cordially agreed with him  there’s poppy down at poplar matilda at chelsea and elizabeth at seabridge continued flower indicating various points on the table with his finger as he spoke some men would give up in despair but i’ve thought of a way out of it i’ve never got into a corner i couldn’t get out of yet  you want a little help though sometimes said fraser  all part of my plans rejoined flower airily if it hadn’t been for my uncle’s interference i should have been all right a man’s no business to be so officious as it is i’ve got to do something decided  if i were you interrupted fraser i should go to captain barber and tell him straight and plain how the thing stands you needn’t mention anything about miss tipping tell him about the other and that you intend to marry her it’ll be beat in the long run and fairer to miss tyrell too  you don’t know my uncle as well as i do retorted the skipper he’s as obstinate an old fool as ever breathed if i did as you say i should lose everything now i’ll tell you what i’m going to do—tonight during your watch i shall come up on deck and stand on the side of the ship to look at something in the water when i shall suddenly hear a shout  the mate who had a piece of dumpling on his fork halfway to his mouth put it down again and regarded him openmouthed  my foot continued the skipper in surprisingly even tones answering his subject will then give way and i shall fall overboard  the mate was about to speak but the skipper gazing in a rapt manner before him waved him into silence  you will alarm the crew and pitch a lifebelt overboard he continued you will then back sails and lower the boat  you’d better take the lifebelt with you hadn’t you enquired the mate anxiously  i shall be picked up by a norwegian barque bound for china continued the skipper ignoring the interruption i shall be away at least six months perhaps more according as things turn out  the mate pushed his scarcely tasted dinner from him and got up from the table it was quite evident to him that the skipper’s love affairs had turned his brain  by the time i get back matilda’ll have ceased from troubling anyway said the skipper and i have strong hopes that elizabeth’ll take gibson i shall stay away long enough to give her a fair chance anyway  but s’pose you get drowned before anything can pick you up suggested the mate feebly  drowned repeated the skipper why you didn’t think i was really going overboard did you i shall be locked up in my stateroom  the mate’s brow cleared and then darkened again suddenly i see some more lies for me to tell i suppose he said angrily  after you’ve raised the alarm and failed to recover the body said the skipper with relish you’ll lock my door and put the key in your pocket that would be the proper thing to do if i really did go overboard you know and when we get to london i’ll just slip quietly ashore  the mate came back to his dinner and finished it in silence while the skipper kept up a rambling fire of instructions for his future guidance  and what about miss tyrell said the mate at length is she to know  certainly not said flower sharply i wouldn’t have her know for anything you’re the only person to know jack you’ll have to break the news to ’em all and mind you do it gently so as not to cause more grief than you can help  i won’t do it at all said the mate  yes you will said flower and if matilda or her mother come down again show it to ’em in the paper then they’ll know it’ll be no good worrying cap’n flower again if they see it in the paper they’ll know it’s true it’s sure to be in the local papers and in the london ones too very likely i should think it would the master of a vessel  fraser being in no mood to regard this vanity complacently went up on deck and declined to have anything to do with the matter he maintained this attitude of immovable virtue until teatime by which time flower’s entreaties had so won upon him that he was reluctantly compelled to admit that it seemed to be the only thing possible in the circumstances and more reluctantly still to promise his aid to the most unscrupulous extent possible  i’ll write to you when i’m fixed up said the skipper giving you my new name and address you’re the only person i shall be able to keep touch with i shall have to rely upon you for everything if it wasn’t for you i should be dead to the world  i know what you’ll do as well as possible said fraser you’ve got nothing to do for six months and you’ll be getting into some more engagements  i don’t think you have any call to say that jack remarked flower with some dignity  well i wish it was well over said the mate despondently what are you going to do for money  i drew out £40 to get married with—furniture and things said flower that’ll go overboard with me of course i’m doing all this for poppy’s sake more than my own and i want you to go up and see her every trip and let me know how she is she mightn’t care what happened to her if she thinks i’m gone and she might marry somebody else in desperation  i don’t care about facing her said fraser bitterly it’s a shady business altogether  it’s for her sake repeated flower calmly take on old ben as mate and ship another hand forward  the mate ended the subject by going to his bunk and turning in the skipper who realised that he himself would have plenty of time for sleep went on deck and sat silently smoking old ben was at the wheel and the skipper felt a glow of selfrightousness as he thought of the rise in life he was about to give the poor fellow  at eight o’clock the mate relieved ben and the skipper with a view of keeping up appearances announced his intention of turning in for a bit  the sun went down behind clouds of smoky red but the light of the summer evening lasted for some time after then darkness came down over the sea and it was desolate except for the sidelights of distant craft the mate drew out his watch and by the light of the binnaclelamp saw that it was ten minutes to ten at the same moment he heard somebody moving about forward  who’s that for’ard he cried smartly  me sir answered joe’s voice i’m a bit wakeful and it’s stiflin’ ’ot down below  the mate hesitated and then glancing at the open skylight saw the skipper who was standing on the table  send him below said the latter in a sharp whisper  you’d better get below joe said the mate  w’y i ain’t doin’ no ’arm sir said joe in surprise  get below said the mate sharply do you hear—get below you’ll be sleeping in your watch if you don’t sleep now  the sounds of a carefully modulated grumble came faintly aft then the mate leaning away from the wheel to avoid the galley which obstructed his view saw that his order had been obeyed  now said the skipper quietly you must give a perfect scream of horror mind and put this on the deck it fell off as i went over d’ye see  he handed over the slipper he had been wearing and the mate took it surlily  there ought to be a splash he murmured joe’s awake  the skipper vanished to reappear a minute or two later with a sack into which he had hastily thrust a few lumps of coal and other rubbish the mate took it from him and placing the slipper on the deck stood with one hand holding the wheel and the other the ridiculous sack  now said the skipper  the sack went overboard and at the same moment the mate left the wheel with an earsplitting yell and rushed to the galley for the lifebelt which hung there he crashed heavily into joe who had rushed on deck but without pausing ran to the side and flung it overboard  skipper’s overboard he yelled running back and putting the helm down  joe put his head down the forescuttle and yelled like a maniac the others came up in their nightgear and in a marvellously short space of time the schooner was hove to and the cook and joe had tumbled into the boat and were pulling back lustily in search of the skipper  half an hour elapsed during which those on the schooner hung over the stern listening intently they could hear the oars in the rowlocks and the shouts of the rowers tim lit a lantern and dangled it over the water  have you got ’im cried ben as the boat came over the darkness and the light of the lantern shone on the upturned faces of the men  no said joe huskily  ben threw him a line and he clambered silently aboard followed by the cook  better put about he said to the mate and cruise about until daylight we ain’t found the belt either and it’s just possible he’s got it  the mate shook his head it’s no good he said confidently he’s gone  well i vote we try anyhow said joe turning on him fiercely how did it happen  he came up on deck to speak to me said the mate shortly he fancied he heard a cry from the water and jumped up on the side with his hand on the rigging to see i s’pose his bad foot slipped and he went over before i could move  we’ll cruise about a bit said joe loudly turning to the men  are you giving orders here or am i said the mate sternly  i am said joe violently it’s our duty to do all we can there was a dead silence joe pushing himself in between ben and the cook eyed the men eagerly  what do you mean by that said the mate at last  wot i say said joe meeting him eye to eye and thrusting his face close to his  the mate shrugged his shoulders and walked slowly aft then with a regard for appearances which the occasion fully warranted took the schooner for a little circular tour in the neighbourhood of the skipper’s disappearance  at daybreak not feeling the loss quite as much as the men he went below and having looked stealthily round unlocked the door of the stateroom and peeped in it was almost uncanny considering the circumstances to see in the dim light the skipper sitting on the edge of his bunk  what the blazes are you doing dodging about like this he burst out ungratefully  looking for the body said the mate ain’t you heard us shouting it’s not my fault—the crew say they won’t leave the spot while there’s half a chance  blast the crew said the skipper quite untouched by this devotion ain’t you taking charge o’ the ship  joe’s about half mad said the mate it’s wonderful how upset he is  the skipper cursed joe separately and the mate whose temper was getting bad closed the interview by locking the door  at five o’clock by which time they had cleared three masses of weed and a barnaclecovered plank they abandoned the search and resumed the voyage a gloom settled on the forecastle and the cook took advantage of the occasion to read tim a homily upon the shortness of life and the suddenness of death tim was much affected but not nearly so much as he was when he discovered that the men were going to pay a last tribute to the late captain’s memory by abstaining from breakfast he ventured to remark that the excitement and the night air had made him feel very hungry and was promptly called an unfeeling little brute by the men for his pains the mate who in deference to public opinion had to keep up appearances the same way was almost as much annoyed as tim and as for the drowned man himself his state of mind was the worst of all he was so ungrateful that the mate at length lost his temper and when dinner was served allowed a latent sense ot humour to have full play  it consisted of boiled beef with duff carrots and potatoes and its grateful incense filled the cabin  the mate attacked it lustily listening between mouthfuls for any interruption from the stateroom at length unable to endure it any longer the prisoner ventured to scratch lightly on the door  hist said the mate in a whisper  the scratching ceased and the mate grinning broadly resumed his dinner he finished at last and lighting his pipe sat back easily in the locker watching the door out of the corner of his eye  with hunger at his vitals the unfortunate skipper hardly able to believe his ears heard the cook come down and clear away the smell of dinner gave way to that of tobacco and the mate having half finished his pipe approached the door  are you there he asked in a whisper  of course i am you fool said the skipper wrathfully where’s my dinner  i’m very sorry began the mate in a whisper  what enquired the skipper fiercely  i’ve mislaid the key said the mate grinning fiendishly an’ what’s more i can’t think what i’ve done with it  at this intelligence the remnants of the skipper’s temper vanished and every bad word he had heard of or read of or dreamt of floated from his hungry lips in frenzied whispers  i can’t hear what you say said the mate what  the prisoner was about to repeat his remarks with a few embellishments when the mate stopped him with one little word hist he said quietly  at the imminent risk of bursting or going mad the skipper stopped short and the mate addressing a remark to the cook who was not present went up on deck  he found the key by teatime and his triumph having made him generous passed the skipper in a large hunk of the cold beef with his tea the skipper took it and eyed him wanly having found an empty stomach very conducive to accurate thinking  the next thing is to slip ashore at wapping jack he said after he had finished his meal the whar’ll be closed by the time we get there  the watchman’s nearly sure to be asleep said fraser and you can easily climb the gate if he’s not i must try and get him out of the way somehow  the skipper’s forebodings proved to be correct it was past twelve by the time they reached wapping but the watchman was wide awake and with much bustle helped them to berth their craft he received the news of the skipper’s untimely end with wellbred sorrow and at once excited the wrath of the sensitive joe by saying that he was not surprised  i ’ad a warning he said solemnly in reply to the indignant seaman larst night exactly as big ben struck ten o’clock the gatebell was pulled three times  i’ve pulled it fifty times myself before now said joe scathingly and then had to climb over the gate and wake you up  i went to the gate at once continued george addressing himself to the cook sometimes when i’m shifting a barge or doing any little job o’ that sort i do ’ave to keep a man waiting and if he’s drunk two minutes seems like ages to ’im  you ought to know wot it seems like muttered joe  when i got to the gate an’ opened it there was nobody there continued the watchman impressively and while i was standing there i saw the bellpull go up an’ down without ’ands and the bell rung agin three times  the cook shivered wasn’t you frightened george he asked sympathetically  i knew it was a warning continued the vivacious george w’y’e should come to me i don’t know one thing is i think ’e always ’ad a bit of a fancy for me  he ’ad said joe everybody wot sees you loves you george they can’t help theirselves  and i ’ave ’ad them two ladies down agin asking for mr robinson and also for poor cap’n flower said the watchman they asked me some questions about ’im and i told ’em the lies wot you told me to tell ’em joe p’r’aps that’s w’y i ’ad the warning  joe turned away with a growl and went below and tim and the cook after greedily waiting for some time to give the watchman’s imagination a further chance followed his example george left to himself took his old seat on the post at the end of the jetty being if the truth must be told somewhat alarmed by his own fertile inventions  three times did the mate in response to the frenzied commands of the skipper come stealthily up the companionway and look at him time was passing and action of some kind was imperative  george he whispered suddenly  sir said the watchman  i want to speak to you said fraser mysteriously come down here  george rose carefully from his seat and lowering himself gingerly on board crept on tiptoe to the galley after the mate  wait in here till i come back said the latter in a thrilling whisper i’ve got something to show you don’t move whatever happens  his tones were so fearful and he put so much emphasis on the last sentence that the watchman burst hurriedly out of the galley  i don’t like these mysteries he said plainly  there’s no mystery said the mate pushing him back again something i don’t want the crew to see that’s all you’re the only man i can trust  he closed the door and coughed and a figure which had been lurking on the companionladder slipped hastily on deck and clambered noiselessly onto the jetty the mate clambered up beside it and hurrying with it to the gate helped it over and with much satisfaction heard it alight on the other side  goodnight jack said flower don’t forget to look after poppy  goodnight said the mate write as soon as you’re fixed  he walked back leisurely to the schooner and stood in some perplexity eyeing the galley which contained the devoted george he stood for so long that his victim lost all patience and sliding back the door peered out and discovered him  have you got it he asked softly  no replied fraser there isn’t anything i was only making a fool of you george goodnight  he walked aft and stood at the companion watching the outraged george as he came slowly out of the galley and stared about him  goodnight george he repeated  the watchman made no reply to the greeting but breathing heavily resumed his old seat on the post and folding his arms across his panting bosom looked down with majestic scorn upon the schooner and all its contents long after the satisfied mate had forgotten the incident in sleep he sat there striving to digest the insult of which he had been the victim and to consider a painful and fitting retribution     chapter ix     the mate awoke next morning to a full sense of the unpleasant task before him and after irritably giving orders for the removal of the tarpaulin from the skylight a substitution of the ingenious cook’s for the drawn blinds ashore sat down to a solitary breakfast and the composition of a telegram to captain barber the first a beautiful piece of prose of which the keynote was resignation contained two shillings’ worth of sympathy and fourpencehalfpenny worth of religion it was too expensive as it stood and boiled down he was surprised to find that it became unfeeling to the verge of flippancy ultimately he embodied it in a letter which he preceded by a telegram breaking the sad news in as gentle a form as could be managed for oneandthree  the best part of the day was spent in relating the sad end of captain fred flower to various enquirers the deceased gentleman was a popular favourite and clerks from the office and brother skippers came down in little knots to learn the full particulars and to compare the accident with others in their experience it reminded one skipper who invariably took to drink when his feelings were touched of the death of a little nephew from whoopingcough and he was so moved over a picture he drew of the meeting of the two that it took four men to get him off the schooner without violence  the mate sat for some time after tea striving to summon up sufficient courage for his journey to poplar and wondering whether it wouldn’t perhaps be better to communicate the news by letter he even went so far as to get the writing materials ready and then remembering his promise to the skipper put them away again and prepared for his visit the crew who were on deck eyed him stolidly as he departed and joe made a remark to the cook which that worthy drowned in a loud and troublesome cough  the wheeler family were at home when he arrived and received him with some surprise mrs wheeler who was in her usual place on the sofa shook hands with him in a genteel fashion and calling his attention to a somewhat loudly attired young man of unpleasant appearance who was making a late tea introduced him as her son bob  is miss tyrell in enquired fraser shaking his head as mr wheeler dusted a small wheeler off a chair and offered it to him  she’s upstairs said emma wheeler shall i go and fetch her  no i’ll go up to her said the mate quietly i think i’d better see her alone i’ve got rather bad news for her  about the captain enquired mrs wheeler sharply  yes said fraser turning somewhat red very bad news  he fixed his eyes on the ground and in a spasmodic fashion made perfect by practice recited the disaster  pore feller said mrs wheeler when he had finished pore feller and cut down suddenly like that i s’pose he ’adn’t made any preparation for it  not a bit said the mate starting quite unprepared  you didn’t jump over after him suggested miss wheeler softly  i did not said the mate firmly whereupon miss wheeler who was fond of penny romance sighed and shook her head  there’s that pore gal upstairs said mrs wheeler sorrowfully all innocent and happy probably expecting him to come tonight and take her out emma’d better go up and break it to ’er  i will said fraser shortly  better to let a woman do it said mrs wheeler when our little jemmy smashed his finger we sent emma down to break it to his father and bring ’im ’ome it was ever so long before she let you know the truth wasn’t it father  made me think all sorts of things with her mysteries said the dutiful mr wheeler in triumphant corroboration first of all she made me think you was dead then i thought you was all dead—give me such a turn they ’ad to give me brandy to bring me round when i found out it was only jemmy’s finger i was nearly off my ’ed with joy  i’ll go and tell her interrupted mr bob wheeler delicately using the inside edge of the tablecloth as a serviette i can do it better than emma can what she wants is comforting emma would go and snivel all over her  mrs wheeler raising her head from the sofa regarded the speaker with looks of tender admiration and the young man after a lengthy glance in the small pierglass ornamented with coloured paper which stood on the mantelpiece walked to the door  you needn’t trouble said fraser slowly i’m going to tell her  mrs wheeler’s dull eyes snapped sharply she’s our lodger she said aggressively  yes but i’m going to tell her rejoined the mate the skipper told me to  a startled silence was broken by mr wheeler’s chair which fell noisily  i mean stammered fraser meeting the perturbed gaze of the dockforeman that he told me once if anything happened to him that i was to break the news to miss tyrell it’s been such a shock to me i hardly know what i am saying  yes you’ll go and frighten her said bob wheeler endeavouring to push past him  the mate blocked the doorway  are you going to try to prevent me going out of a room in my own house blustered the young man  of course not said fraser and giving way ascended the stairs before him mr wheeler junior after a moment’s hesitation turned back and muttering threats under his breath returned to the parlour  miss tyrell who was sitting by the window reading rose upon the mate’s entrance and observing that he was alone evinced a little surprise as she shook hands with him it was the one thing necessary to complete his discomfiture and he stood before her in a state of guilty confusion  cap’n flower couldn’t come he stammered  the girl said nothing but with her dark eyes fixed upon his flushed face waited for him to continue  it’s his misfortune that he couldn’t come continued fraser jerkily  business i suppose said the girl after another wait won’t you sit down  bad business replied fraser he sat down and fancied he saw the way clear before him  you’ve left him on the foam i suppose said poppy seeing that she was expected to speak  no farther back than that was the response  seabridge queried the girl with an air of indifference  fraser regarded her with an expression of studied sadness not so far back as that he said softly  miss tyrell manifested a slight restlessness is it a sort of riddle she demanded  no it’s a tale replied fraser not without a secret admiration of his unsuspected powers of breaking bad news a tale with a bad ending  the girl misunderstood him if you mean that captain flower doesn’t want to come here and sent you to say so— she began with dignity  he can’t come interrupted the mate hastily  did he send you to tell me she asked  fraser shook his head mournfully he can’t come he said in a low voice he had a bad foot—night before last he was standing on the ship’s side—when he lost his hold—  he broke off and eyed the girl nervously and fell overboard he concluded  poppy tyrell gave a faint cry and springing to her feet stood with her hand on the back of her chair regarding him poor fellow she said softly—poor fellow  she sat down again by the open window and nervously plucked at the leaves of a geranium her face was white and her dark eyes pitiful and tender fraser watching her cursed his resourceful skipper and hated himself  it’s a terrible thing for his friends said poppy at length and for you said fraser respectfully  i am very grieved said poppy quietly very shocked and very grieved  i have got strong hopes that he may have got picked up said fraser cheerfully very strong hopes i threw him a lifebelt and though we got the boat out and pulled about we couldn’t find either of them i shouldn’t be at all surprised if he has been picked up by some vessel outward bound stranger things have happened  the girl shook her head you didn’t go overboard after him she asked quietly  i did not said the mate who was somewhat tired of this tactless question i had to stand by the ship and besides he was a much better swimmer than i am—i did the best i could  miss tyrell bowed her head in answer yes she said softly  if there’s anything i can do said fraser awkwardly or be of use to you in any way i hope you’ll let me know—flower told me you were all alone and—  he broke off suddenly as he saw the girl’s lips quiver i was very fond of my father she said in extenuation of this weakness  i suppose you’ve got some relatives said fraser  the girl shook her head  no cousins said fraser staring he had twentythree himself  i have some in new zealand said poppy considering if i could i think i should go out there  and give up your business here enquired the mate anxiously  it gave me up said poppy with a little tremulous laugh i had a week’s pay instead of notice the day before yesterday if you know anybody who wants a clerk who spells ’impatient’ with a ’y’ and is offhand when they are told of it you might let me know  the mate stared at her blankly this was a far more serious case than captain flower’s what are you going to do he asked  try for another berth was the reply  but if you don’t get it  i shall get it sooner or later said the girl  but suppose you don’t get one for a long time suggested fraser  i must wait till i do said the girl quietly  you see continued the mate twisting his hands it might be a long job and i—i was wondering—what you would do in the meantime i was wondering whether you could hold out  hold out repeated miss tyrell very coldly  whether you’ve got enough money blurted the mate  miss tyrell turned upon him a face in which there was now no lack of colour that is my business she said stiffly  mine too said fraser gazing steadily at the pretty picture of indignation before him i was flower’s friend as well as his mate and you are only a girl the indignation became impatience little more than a child he murmured scrutinising her  i am quite big enough to mind my own business said poppy reverting to chilly politeness  i wish you would promise me you won’t leave here or do anything until i have seen you again’’ said fraser who was anxious to consult his captain on this new phase of affairs  certainly not said miss tyrell rising and standing by her chair and thank you for calling  fraser rubbed his chin helplessly  thank you for calling repeated the girl still standing  that is telling me to go i suppose said fraser looking at her frankly i wish i knew how to talk to you when i think of you being here all alone without friends and without employment it seems wrong for me to go and leave you here  miss tyrell gave a faint gasp and glanced anxiously at the door fraser hesitated a moment and then rose to his feet  if i hear anything more may i come and tell you he asked  yes said poppy or write perhaps it would be better to write i might not be at home goodbye  the mate shook hands and blundering down the stairs shouted goodnight to a segment of the wheeler family visible through the halfopen door and passed out into the street he walked for some time rapidly gradually slowing down as he collected his thoughts  flower’s a fool he said bitterly and as for me i don’t know what i am it’s so long since i told the truth i forget what it’s like and i’d sooner tell lies in a church than tell them to her     chapter x     he looked expectantly on the cabin table for a letter upon his return to the ship but was disappointed and the only letter yielded by the post next morning came from captain barber it was couched in terms of great resignation and after bemoaning the unfortunate skipper’s untimely demise in language of great strength wound up with a little scripture and asked the mate to act as master and sail the schooner home  you’ll act as mate ben to take her back said the new skipper thrusting the letter in his pocket  aye aye sir said ben with a side glance at joe but i’ll keep for’ard if you don’t mind  as you please said fraser staring  and you’re master i s’pose said joe turning to fraser  fraser whose manner had already effected the little change rendered necessary by his promotion from mate to master nodded curtly and the crew after another exchange of looks resumed their work without a word their behaviour all day was docile not to say lamblike and it was not until evening that the new skipper found it necessary to enforce his authority  the exciting cause of the unpleasantness was mr william green a slim furtiveeyed young man whom fraser took on in the afternoon to fill the vacancy caused by ben’s promotion he had not been on board half an hour before trouble arose from his attempt to introduce the manners of the drawingroom into the forecastle  mr willyum green repeated joe when the new arrival had introduced himself well you’ll be bill ’ere  i don’t see why if i call you mr smith you shouldn’t call me mr green said the other  call me wot enquired joe sternly you let me ’ear you callin’ me mister anythink that’s all you let me ’ear you  i’m sure the cook ’ere don’t mind me callin’ ’im mr fisher said the new seaman  cert’nly not said the gratified cook only my name’s disher  the newcomer apologised with an urbanity that rendered joe and old ben speechless they gazed at each other in silent consternation and then ben rose  we don’t want no misters ’ere he said curtly an’ wot’s more we won’t ’ave ’em that chap’s name’s bob but we calls ’im slushy if it’s good enough for us it’s good enough for a ordinary seaman wot’s got an a b discharge by mistake let me ’ear you call ’im slushy go on now  i’ve no call to address ’im at all just now said mr green loftily  you call ’im slushy roared joe advancing upon him call ’im slushy till i tell you to stop  slushy said mr green sullenly and avoiding the pained gaze of the cook slushy slushy slushy slushy sl——  that’ll do said the cook rising with a scowl you don’t want to make a song abart it  joe content with his victory resumed his seat on the locker and exchanged a reassuring glance with ben mr green with a deprecatory glance at the cook sat down and offered him a pipe of tobacco  been to sea long enquired the cook accepting it  not long said the other speaking very distinctly  i was brought up for something quite different i’m just doing this till something better turns up i find it very difficult to be a gentleman at sea  the cook with an eye on joe ventured on a gentle murmur of sympathy and said that he had experienced the same thing  i ’ad money continued mr green musingly and i run through it then i ’ad more money and i run through that  ben said joe suddenly pass me over that boot o’ yours  wha’ for enquired ben who had just taken it off  to chuck at that swab there said the indignant seaman  ben passed it over without a word and his irritated friend taking careful aim launched it at mr green and caught him on the side of the head with it pain standing the latter in lieu of courage he snatched it up and returned it and the next moment the whole forecastle was punching somebody else’s head while tim in a state of fearful joy peered down on it from his bunk  victory rendered cheap and easy by reason of the purblindness of the frantic cook who was trying to persuade mr green to raise his face from the floor so that he could punch it for him remained with joe and ben who in reply to the angry shouts of the skipper from above pointed silently to the combatants explanations all different and all ready to be sworn to if desired ensued and fraser after curtly reminding ben of his new position and requesting him to keep order walked away  a silence broken only by the general compliments of the much gratified tim followed his departure although another outbreak nearly occurred owing to the cook supplying raw meat for mr green’s eye and refusing it for joe’s it was the lack of consideration and feeling that affected joe not for the want of the beef that little difficulty being easily surmounted by taking mr green’s the tumult was just beginning again when it was arrested by the sound of angry voices above tim followed by joe sprang up the ladder and the couple with their heads at the opening listened with appreciative enjoyment to a wordy duel between mrs tipping and daughter and the watchman  call me a liar then said old george in bereaved accents  i have said mrs tipping  only you’re so used to it you don’t notice it remarked her daughter scathingly  i tell you he’s drownded said the watchman raising his voice if you don’t believe me go and ask mr fraser he’s skipper in his place now  he waved his hand in the direction of fraser who having heard the noise was coming on deck to see the cause of it mrs tipping compressing her lips got on board followed by her daughter and marching up to him eyed him severely  i wonder you can look us in the face after the trick you served us the other night she said fiercely  you brought it on yourselves said fraser calmly you wouldn’t go away you know you can’t always be coming here worrying  we shall come whenever we choose said mrs tipping in the first place we want to see mr robinson anyway we intend to see captain flower so you can save that fat old man the trouble of telling us lies about him  captain flower fell overboard night before last if that’s what you mean said fraser gravely  i never saw such a man in all my life exclaimed mrs tipping wrathfully you’re a perfect—what’s the man’s name in the scriptures she asked turning to her daughter  miss tipping shaking her head despondently requested her parent not to worry her  well it doesn’t signify i shall wait here till he comes said mrs tipping  what ananias cried fraser forgetting himself  mrs tipping scorning to reply stood for some time gazing thoughtfully about her then in compliance with her whispered instructions her daughter crossed to the side and brushing aside the outstretched hand of the watchman reached the jetty and walked into the office two of the clerks were still working there and she came back hastily to her mother with the story of the captain’s death unmistakably confirmed  mrs tipping loath to accept defeat stood for some time in consideration what had captain flower to do with mr robinson she asked at length turning to fraser  can’t say was the reply  have you ever seen mr robinson enquired the girl  i saw him one night said the other after some deliberation rather goodlooking man bright blue eyes good teeth and a jolly laugh  are you likely to see him again enquired miss tipping nodding in confirmation of these details  not now poor flower’s gone replied fraser i fancy we shipped some cases of rifles for him one night the night you first came i don’t know what it all was about but he struck me as being rather a secretive sort of man  he was that sighed miss tipping shaking her head  i heard him say that night said the mate forgetful of his recent longings after truth that he was off abroad he said that something was spoiling his life i remember but that duty came first  there do you hear that mother said miss tipping  yes i hear said the other with an aggressive sniff as she moved slowly to the side but i’m not satisfied that the captain is dead they’d tell us anything you’ve not seen the last of me young man i can tell you  i hope not said fraser cordially any time the ship’s up in london and you care to come down i shall be pleased to see you  mrs tipping heated with the climb received this courtesy with coldness and having enquired concerning the fate of captain flower of six different people and verified their accounts from the landlord of the publichouse at the corner to whom she introduced herself with much aplomb as being in the profession went home with her daughter in whom depression in its most chronic form had settled in the form of unfilial disrespect  two hours later the foam got under way and after some heated language owing to the watchman mistaking mr green’s urbanity for sarcasm sailed slowly down the river the hands were unusually quiet but their behaviour passed unnoticed by the new skipper who was too perturbed by the falsehoods he had told and those he was about to tell to take much heed of anything that was passing  i thought you said you preferred to keep for’ard he said to ben as that worthy disturbed his meditations next morning by bustling into the cabin and taking his seat at the breakfast table  i’ve changed my mind the men don’t know their place said the mate shortly  fraser raised his eyebrows  forget who i am said ben gruffly i was never one to take much count of such things but when it comes to being patted on the back by an a b it’s time to remind ’em  did they do that said fraser in a voice of horror  joe did said ben ’e won’t do it ag’in i don’t think i didn’t say anything but i think ’e knows my feelings  there’s your berth said fraser indicating it with a nod  ben grunted in reply and being disinclined for conversation busied himself with the meal and as soon as he had finished went up on deck  wot yer been down there for bennie asked joe severely as he appeared your tea’s all cold  i’ve ’ad my breakfast with the skipper said ben shortly  you was always fond of your stummick bennie said joe shaking his head sorrowfully i don’t think much of a man wot leaves his old mates for a bit o’ bacon  the new mate turned away from him haughtily tim he said sharply  yes ben said the youth why wot’s the matter wot are you looking like that for ain’t you well wot did you call me demanded the new mate  i didn’t call you anything said the startled tim  let me ’ear you call me ben ag’in and you’ll hear of it said the other sharply go and clean the brasswork  the youth strolled off gasping with an envious glance at the cook who standing just inside the galley cheerfully flaunted a saucepan he was cleaning as though defying the mate to find him any work to do  bill said the mate  sir said the polite seaman  help joe scrub paintwork was the reply  me broke in the indignant joe  scrub—look ’ere ben  pore old joe said the cook who had not forgiven him for the previous night’s affair pore old joe  don’t stand gaping about commanded the new mate liven up there  it don’t want cleaning i won’t do it said joe fiercely  i’ve give my orders said the new mate severely if they ain’t attended to or if i ’ear any more about not doing ’em you’ll hear of it the idea o’ telling me you won’t do it the idea o’ setting such an example to the young ’uns the idea—wot are you making that face for  i’ve got the earache retorted joe with bitter sarcasm  i thought you would ’ave joe said the vengeful cook retiring behind a huge fryingpan when i ’eard you singing this morning  fraser coming on deck was just in time to see a really creditable imitation of a famous sculpture as represented by joe tim and ben but his criticism was so sharp and destructive that the group at once broke and never reformed indeed with a common foe in the person of ben the crew adjusted their own differences and by the time seabridge was in sight were united by all the fearful obligations of a secret society of which joe was the perpetual president  captain barber with as much mourning as he could muster at such short notice was waiting on the quay his weatherbeaten face was not quite so ruddy as usual and fraser with a strong sense of shame fancied as the old man clambered aboard the schooner that his movements were slower than of yore  this is a dreadful business jack he said giving him a hearty grip when at length he stood aboard the schooner  shocking said fraser reddening  i’ve spoken to have the coastguards look out for him said the old man he may come ashore and i know he’d be pleased to be put in the churchyard decent  i’m sure he would said fraser i suppose there’s no chance of his having been picked up i slung a lifebelt overboard  captain barber shook his head it’s a mysterious thing he said slowly a man who’d been at sea all his life to go and tumble overboard in calm weather like that  there’s a lot that’s mysterious about it sir said joe who had drawn near followed by the others i can say that because i was on deck only a few minutes before it happened  pity you didn’t stay up said captain barber ruefully  so i thought sir said joe but the mate saw me on deck and made me go below two minutes afterwards i heard a splash and the skipper was overboard  there was a meaning in his words that there was no mistaking the old man looking round at the faces saw that the mate’s was very pale  what did he make you go below for he asked turning to joe  better ask him sir replied the seaman i wanted to stay up on deck but i ’ad to obey orders if i ’ad stayed on deck he wouldn’t have been cap’n  captain barber turned and regarded the mate fixedly the mate after a vain attempt to meet his gaze lowered his eyes to the deck  what do you say to all this enquired barber slowly  nothing replied the mate i did send joe below and the skipper fell overboard a minute or two afterwards it’s quite true  fell enquired captain barber  fell repeated the other and looked him squarely in the eyes  for some time captain barber said nothing and the men finding the silence irksome shuffled uneasily  fred saved your life once said barber at length  he did replied fraser  the old man turned and paced slowly up and down the deck  he was my sister’s boy he said halting in front of the mate but he was more like my son his father and mother were drownded too but they went down fair and square in a gale he stuck by his ship and she stuck by him god bless her  fraser nodded  i’m obliged to you for bringing my ship from london said barber slowly i sha’n’t want you to take ’er back i sha’n’t want you to stay in ’er at all i don’t want to see you again  that’s as you please said fraser trying to speak unconcernedly it’s your ship and it’s for you to do as you like about her i’ll put my things together now  you don’t ask for no reason asked barber eyeing him wistfully  the other shook his head no he said simply and went below  he came up some little time later with his belongings in a couple of chests and the men offering no assistance put them ashore himself and hailing a man who was sitting in a cart on the quay arranged with him to convey them to the station  is ’e to be let go like this said joe hotly  will you stop me demanded fraser choking with rage as he stepped aboard again  joe said ben sharply  the seaman glared at him offensively  go for’ard said the new mate peremptorily go for’ard and don’t make yourself so busy  the seaman helpless with rage looked to captain barber for guidance and the old man endorsing the new mate’s order went forward indulging in a soliloquy in which ben as a proper noun was mixed up in the company of many improper adjectives  fraser clambering into the cart looked back at the foam the old man was standing with his hands clasped behind his back looking down on the deck while the hands stood clumsily by with an idea that the position had suddenly become intolerable he sat silent until they reached the station and being for the first time for many months in the possession of a holiday resolved for various reasons to pay a dutiful visit to his father at bittlesea     chapter xi     captain barber walked to his house in thoughtful mood and sighed as he thought of the uncertainty of life and the futility of earthly wishes the blinds at his windows were all decently drawn while the union jack drooped at halfmast in the front garden he paused at the gate with a strong distaste for encountering the subdued gloom and the wealth of womanly love which awaited him indoors and bethinking himself of the masterless state of his craft walked slowly back and entered the thorn inn  no news i suppose captain barber said the landlady regarding him with great sympathy  the captain shook his head and exchanging greetings with a couple of neighbours ordered something to drink  it’s wonderful how you bear up i’m sure said the landlady when my poor dear died i cried every day for five weeks i came down to skin and bone almost  well if i was you— said the old man irritably and regarding the lady’s ample proportions with an unfavourable eye  what enquired the other pausing with her fingers on the whiskytap  if i was you repeated captain barber slowly in order to give time for full measure i should go an’ cry for five months all day and all night  the landlady put the glass in front of him sharply and after giving him his change without looking at him thoughtfully wiped down the counter  mrs church quite well she enquired with studied artlessness  quite well replied the captain scenting danger  the landlady smiling amiably subsided into a comfortable windsorchair and shook her head at him so severely that against his better sense he felt compelled to demand an explanation  there there replied the landlady get along with you do innocence  it’s no good cap’n barber said one of the customers with the best intentions in the world  it struck me all of a heap said the landlady  so it did me said the other man  my missus knew it all along said the first man she said she knew it by the way they looked at one another  might i ask who you’re talking of demanded the incensed barber who had given up the effort to appear unconscious as being beyond his powers  a young engaged couple said the landlady  the captain hesitated what have you been shaking your head at me and telling me it’s no good for then he demanded  at your pretending not to have heard of it said the landlady  i have not ’eard of it said captain barber fiercely as he took up his glass and walked towards the parlour i’ve got something better to do than talk about my neighbours’ affairs  yes of course you have said the landlady we know that  the indignant barber closed the door behind him with a bang and excited with the controversy returned with a short and suspicious nod the greeting of a small man of shrunken and forlorn aspect who was sitting at the other side of the room  mornin’ cap’n nibletts he growled  mornin sir said nibletts how’s things  captain barber shook his head bad as bad can be he replied slowly there’s no hope at all i’m looking for a new master for my vessel  nibletts looked up at him eagerly and then looked away again his last command had hoisted the green flag at the mouth of the river in a position which claimed attention respect and profanity from every craft which passed its master having been only saved from the traditional death of the devoted shipmaster by the unpardonable conduct of the mate who tore him from his craft by the scruff of his neck and the seat of his trousers  what about harris he suggested  i don’t like harris’s ways said barber slowly  well what about fletcher said nibletts  fletcher’s ways are worse than wot harris’s ways are commented captain barber  i can understand you being careful said captain nibletts she’s the prettiest little craft that ever sailed out of seabridge you can’t be too careful  if things ’ad been different said the gratified owner rolling his whisky round his mouth and swallowing it gently i’d have liked you to have ’ad her  thankee said nibletts quietly  there was a pause during which both men eyed the noble specimens of fish which are preserved for tavern parlours captain barber took another sip of whisky  i’m going to use my own judgment nibletts he said slowly i’ve always rose superior to the opinions of other people there’s nobody you know would give you a ship i’m going to give you the foam  captain nibletts rising from his seat crossed over and taking his hand thanked him in broken accents for this overpowering expression of confidence in him then he walked back and taking his whisky from the table threw it on the floor  i’ve had enough of that he said briefly when am i to take her over cap’n barber  so soon as ever you please said his benefactor old ben’ll stay on as mate fraser’s gone  captain nibletts thanked him again and clapping on his hard hat passed hastily into the bar his small visage twisted into a smile to which it had long been a stranger with the customers in the bar he exchanged remarks of so frivolous a nature in passing that the landlady nearly dropped the glass she was wiping and then crimson with indignation as the door swung behind him realised that the melancholy and usually respectful nibletts had thought fit to publicly address her as gertie  in the same high spirits the new master swung hastily down the road to his new command work had already commenced and the energetic ben having been pushed over once by a set of goods in the slings owing to the frantic attempts of the men at the handcrane to keep pace with his demands was shouting instructions from a safe distance he looked round as nibletts stepped aboard and with a wary eye on the crane bustled towards him  wot can we do for you cap’n nibletts he enquired with a patronising air  i’m to be master replied the other quietly  you said ben with offensive astonishment as he saw the death of his own ambitious hopes in that quarter you to be master  nibletts nodded and coloured cap’n barber just gave me the berth he remarked  ben sighed and shook his head he’ll never be the same man ag’in he affirmed positively ’e went away from ’ere dazed quite dazed ’ow was ’e when you saw ’im  he was all right was the reply  ben shook his head as one who knew better i ’ope he won’t get no more shocks he observed gravely it’ll be nice for you to get to sea ag’in cap’n  captain nibletts raised his weatherbeaten countenance and sniffed the air with relish  you’ll be able to see the diadem as we go by continued the sorelyaggravated ben there’s just her masts showing at ’igh water  a faint laugh rose from somebody in the hold and nibletts his face a dull red stole quietly below and took possession of his new quarters in the course of the day he transferred his belongings to the schooner and as though half fearful that his new command might yet slip through his fingers slept on board  on the way back to london a sum in simple proportion set by joe helped to exercise the minds of the crew in the rare intervals which the new mate allowed them for relaxation if ben was bad on the fust v’y’ge and much wuss on the second wot ’ud he be like on the tenth all agreed that the answer would require a lot of working they tarred the rigging stropped the blocks and in monkeylike attitudes scraped the masts even the cook received a little instruction in his art and estranged the affections of all hands by a threedecker made under ben’s personal supervision  the secret society discussed the matter for some time in vain the difficulty was not so much in inventing modes of retaliation as in finding some bold spirit to carry them out in vain did the president allot tasks to his admiring followers preceded by excellent reasons why he should not perform them himself the only one who showed any spirit at all was tim and he being ordered to spill a little tar carelessly from aloft paid so much attention to the adverb that joe half killed him when he came down again  then mr william green having learnt that the mate was unable to read did wonders with a piece of chalk and the frying pan which he hung barometer fashion outside the galley when the skipper was below the laughter of the delighted crew bearing witness to the success of his efforts laughter which became almost uncontrollable as the mate with as stately an air as he could assume strode towards the galley and brought up in front of the fryingpan  wot’s all that cook he demanded pointing to the writing  wot sir asked the innocent  on the fryingpan replied ben scowling  that’s chalkmarks explained the cook to clean it with  it looks to me like writing snapped the mate  lor no sir said the cook with a superior smile  i say it does said ben stamping  well o’ course you know best sir said the cook humbly i ain’t nothing of a scholard myself if it’s writing wot does it say please  i don’t say it is writing growled the old man i say it looks like it  i can assure you you’re mistook sir said the cook blandly you see i clean the sorsepans the same way i only ’eard of it lately look ’ere  he placed the articles in question upside down in a row on the deck and tim reading the legends inscribed thereon and glancing from them to the mate was hastily led below in an overwrought condition by the flattered mr green  cook said the mate ferociously  sir said the other  i won’t ’ave the sorsepans cleaned that way  no sir said the cook respectfully it does make ’em larf don’t it sir though i can’t see wot they’re larfing at any more than wot you can  the mate walked off fuming and to his other duties added that of inspector of pots and pans a condition of things highly offensive to the cook inasmuch as certain culinary arrangements of his only remotely connected with cleanliness came in for much unskilled comment  the overworked crew went ashore at the earliest possible moment after their arrival in london in search of recuperative draughts ben watched them a trifle wistfully as they moved off and when nibletts soon after followed their example without inviting him to join him in a social glass of superior quality smiled mournfully as he thought of the disadvantages of rank  he sat for some time smoking in silence monarch of all he surveyed and then gazing abstractedly at the silent craft around him fell into a pleasant dream in which he saw himself in his rightful position as master of the foam and nibletts cashiered for drunkenness coming to him for employment before the mast his meditations were disturbed by a small piece of coal breaking on the deck at which he looked lazily until finding it followed by two other pieces he reluctantly came to the conclusion that they were intended for him a fourth piece better aimed put the matter beyond all reasonable doubt and looking up sharply he caught the watchman in the act of launching the fifth  hullo old ’un said george cheerfully i thought you was asleep  you thought wrong then said the mate sourly don’t you do that ag’in  why did i ’urt you said the other surprised at his tone  next time you want to chuck coal at anybody continued ben with dignity pick out one o’ the ’ands mates don’t like ’aving coal chucked at ’em by watchmen  look who we are gasped the petrified george look who we are he repeated helplessly look who we are  keep your place watchman said the mate severely keep your place and i’ll keep mine  the watchman regarded him for some time in genuine astonishment and then taking his old seat on the post thrust his hands in his pockets and gave utterance to this shocking heresy mates ain’t nothing  you mind your business watchman said the nettled ben and i’ll mind mine  you don’t know it retorted the other breathing heavily be—sides you don’t look like a mate i wouldn’t chuck coal at a real mate  he said no more but sat gazing idly up and down the river with a face from which all expression had been banished except when at intervals his gaze rested upon the mate when it lit up with an expression of wonder and joy which made the muscles ache with the exercise  he was interrupted in this amusement by the sound of footsteps and feminine voices behind him the indefatigable tippings were paying another of their informal visits and calmly ignoring his presence came to the edge of the jetty and discussed ways and means of boarding the schooner  mr fraser’s gone said the watchman politely and loudly there’s a new skipper now and that tall fine ’andsome smart goodlooking young feller down there is the new mate  the new mate looking up fiercely acknowledged the introduction with an inhospitable stare a look which gave way to one of anxiety as mrs tipping stepping into the rigging suddenly lost her nerve and gripping it tightly shook it in much the same fashion as a stout bluebottle shakes the web of a spider  hold tight mar cried her daughter excitedly  the watchman stepped into the rigging beside her and patted her soothingly on the back the mate coming to the side took her foot and assisted her to reach the deck miss tipping followed and the elder lady after recovering from the shock caused by her late peril fell to discussing the eternal subject of mr robinson with the new mate  no i never see ’im said ben thoughtfully i never heard of him till you come asking arter ’im  you must make up your mind he’s gone said mrs tipping turning to her daughter that’s what i keep telling you i never was so tired of anything in my life as tramping down here night after night it ain’t respectable  you needn’t come said the other dutifully he was last heard of on this ship and where else am i to look for him you said you’d like to find him yourself  i should said mrs tipping grimly i should me an’ him are to have a little talk if ever we do meet  if he ever comes aboard this ship said the mate firmly i’ll tackle him for you  find out where he lives said mrs tipping eagerly  and let us know added her daughter giving him a card that’s our address and any time you’re up our way we shall be very pleased to see you mr——  brown said the mate charmed with their manners mr brown  ben cried a voice from the wharf  the new mate gazed austerely at the small officeboy above  letter for the mate said the youth who was unversed in recent history catch  he pitched it to the deck and walked off whistling there was only one mate in ben’s world and he picked the letter up and put it in his pocket  don’t mind us if you want to read it said mrs tipping kindly  only business i expect said ben grandly  he took it from his pocket and tearing the envelope threw it aside and made a feint of reading the contents  not bad news i hope said mrs tipping noticing his wrinkled brow  i can’t read without my glasses said the mate with a measure of truth in the statement he looked at mrs tipping and saw a chance of avoiding humiliation  p’r’aps you’d just look at it and see if it’s important he suggested  mrs tipping took the letter from him and after remarking on the strangeness of the handwriting read aloud—  dear jack—if you want to see mr norton come to 10 john street walworth and be careful nobody sees you  jack said the mate stooping for the envelope  why it must be meant for mr—for jack fraser  careful nobody sees you murmured miss tipping excitedly as she took the envelope from the mate why the address is printed by hand  mother and daughter looked at each other it was evident that their thoughts were similar and that one could have known them without the expenditure of the proverbial penny  i’ll give it to him when i see him remarked ben thrusting the letter in his pocket it don’t seem to be important he ain’t in london at present i don’t think  i shouldn’t think it was important at all said mrs tipping soothingly  not at all echoed her daughter whose cheek was burning with excitement goodnight mr brown  ben bade them goodnight and in his capacity of host walked up the wharf with them and saw them depart  nice little thing ain’t she said the watchman who was standing there after mrs tipping had bidden the mate goodbye be careful wot you’re adoin’ of ben don’t go and spile yourself by a early marriage just as you’re abeginning to get on in life besides a mate might do better than that and she’d only marry you for your persition     chapter xii     in happy ignorance of the changes caused by his sudden and tragic end captain flower sat at the open window of his shabby walworth lodging smoking an afterbreakfast pipe and gazing idly into the dismal littered yard beneath time—owing to his injured foot which neatly bandaged at a local dispensary rested upon a second chair—hung rather heavily upon his hands as he sat thinking of ways and means of spending the next six months profitably and pleasantly he had looked at the oleographs on the walls until he was tired and even the marvels of the wax fruit under a cracked glass shade began to pall upon him  i’ll go and stay in the country a bit he muttered i shall choke here  he took a slice of bread from the tray and breaking it into small pieces began to give breakfast to three hens which passed a precarious existence in the yard below  they get quite to know you now said the small but shrewd daughter of the house who had come in to clear the breakfast things away how’d you like your egg  very good said flower  it was new laid said the small girl  she came up to the window and critically inspected the birds she laid it she said indicating one of the three  she’s not much to look at said flower regarding the weirdestlooking of the three with some interest  she’s a wonderful layer said miss chiffers and as sharp as you make ’em when she’s in the dustbin the others ’ave to stay outside they can go in when she’s ’ad all she wants  i don’t think i’ll have any more eggs said flower casually i’m eating too much bacon’ll do by itself  please yourself said miss chiffers turning from the window how’s your foot  better said flower  it’s swelled more than it was yesterday she said with illconcealed satisfaction  it feels better said the captain  that’s ’cos it’s goin’ dead said the damsel then it’ll go black all up your leg and then you’ll ’ave to ’ave it orf  flower grinned comfortably  you may larf said the small girl severely but you won’t larf when you lose it an’ all becos you won’t poultice it with tea leaves  she collected the things together on a tea tray of enormous size and holding it tightly pressed to her small waist watched with anxious eyes as the heavy articles slowly tobogganed to the other end a knife fell outside the door and the loaf after a moment’s hesitation which nearly upset the tray jumped over the edge and bounded downstairs  flower knocked the ashes out of his pipe and slowly refilling it began to peruse the morning paper looking in vain as he had looked each morning for an account of his death  his reading was interrupted by a loud knock at the street door and he threw down the paper to be ready to receive the faithful fraser he heard the door open and then the violent rushing upstairs of miss chiffers to announce his visitor  somebody to see you mr norton she panted bursting into the room  well show him up said flower  all of ’em demanded miss chiffers  is there more than one enquired flower in a startled voice  three said miss chiffers nodding two gentlemen and a lady  did they say what their names were enquired the other turning very pale  miss chiffers shook her head and then stooped to pick up a hairpin one of ’em’s called dick she said replacing the pin  tell them i’m not at home said flower hastily but that i shall be back at twelve o’clock see  he produced a shilling and the small girl with an appreciative nod left the room and closed the door behind her flower suffering severely from nervous excitement heard a discussion in the passage below and then sounds of a great multitude coming upstairs and opening various doors on its way in spite of the indignant opposition afforded by the daughter of the house  what’s in here enquired a wellknown voice as a hand was placed on his door handle  nothing said miss chiffers ’ere you go away that’s my bedroom go away d’you ’ear  there was the sound of a diminutive scuffle outside then the door opened and a smartlydressed young man regardless of the fair form of miss chiffers which was coiled round his leg entered the room  why dick said the skipper rising dick thank goodness it’s you  i’ve no doubt you’re delighted said mr tipping coldly what are you doing with that knife  i thought it was somebody else said flower putting it down i thought it was another attempt on my life  mr tipping coughed behind his hand and murmured something inaudibly as his sister entered the room followed by the third member of the party  oh fred she said wildly i wonder you can look me in the face where have you been all this time where have you been  give the man time to think said her brother exchanging a glance with the other man  i’ve been everywhere said flower facing them defiantly i’ve been hunted all over the country  but where did you go when you left me that day enquired miss tipping  it’s a long story said flower slowly but you got the letter i wrote you  miss tipping shook her head  you didn’t get it said flower in surprise i can’t think what you must have thought of me  i’ll tell you what i thought of you if you’d like to know interrupted mr tipping eagerly  i wrote to you to explain said flower glibly i went abroad suddenly called away at a moment’s notice  special trains and all that sort o’ thing i s’pose said mr tipping with interest  dick said miss tipping fiercely  well said dick gruffly  hold your tongue  i’ve not had any real sleep since said flower pathetically what with the danger and thinking of you  why didn’t you write again enquired miss tipping  i asked you to write to a certain address in that letter i sent you said flower and when i came back to england and found there was no letter i concluded that you couldn’t forgive me  miss tipping looked at him reproachfully but mr tipping raising his eyes gasped for air  but who are these enemies asked miss tipping tenderly drawing closer to flower  a man in the government service—— began the captain  he broke off disdainfully until such time as mr tipping should have conquered a somewhat refractory cough  in the secret service continued flower firmly has got enemies all round him  you’ll have to get something else to do when we are married fred said miss tipping tearfully  you’ve forgiven me then said flower hoping that he had concealed a nervous start  i’d forgive you anything fred said miss tipping tenderly you’ll have to give up this job at once  captain flower shook his head and smiled mournfully thereby intimating that his services were of too valuable a nature for any government to lightly dispense with  may i come round and see you tomorrow he enquired putting his arm about the lady’s waist  come round tomorrow repeated miss tipping in surprise why you don’t think i’m going to leave you here surrounded by dangers you’re coming home with us now  no tomorrow said the unhappy mariner in a winning voice  you don’t go out of my sight again said miss tipping firmly dick you and fred shake hands  the two gentlemen complied both were somewhat proud of their grip and a bystander might have mistaken their amiable efforts to crush each other’s fingers for the outward and visible signs of true affection  you’d better settle up here now fred said miss tipping  flower putting the best face he could upon it assented with a tender smile and following them downstairs held a long argument with mrs chiffers as to the amount due that lady having ideas upon the subject which did more credit to her imagination than her arithmetic  the bill was settled at last and the little party standing on the steps waited for the return of miss chiffers who had been dispatched for a fourwheeler  oh what about your luggage fred enquired miss tipping suddenly  haven’t got any said flower quickly i managed to get away with what i stand up in and glad to do that  miss tipping squeezed his arm and leaned heavily upon his shoulder  i was very lucky to get off as i did continued the veracious mariner i wasn’t touched except for a rap over my foot with the buttend of a revolver i was just over the wall in time  poor fellow said miss tipping softly as she shivered and looked up into his face what are you grinning at dick  i s’pose a fellow may grin if he likes said mr tipping suddenly becoming serious  this is the first bit of happiness i’ve had since i saw you last murmured flower  miss tipping squeezed his arm again  it seems almost too good to be true he continued i’m almost afraid i shall wake up and find it all a dream  oh you’re wideawake enough said mr tipping  wideawake ain’t the word for it said the other gentleman shaking his head  uncle said miss tipping sharply  yes my dear said the other uneasily  keep your remarks for those that like them said his dutiful niece or else get out and walk  mr porson being thus heckled subsided into defiant mutterings intended for dick tipping’s ear alone and the remainder of the drive to chelsea passed almost in silence arrived at the blue posts flower got out with wellsimulated alacrity and going into the bar shook hands heartily with mrs tipping before she quite knew what he was doing  you’ve got him then she said turning to her daughter and now i hope you’re satisfied don’t stand in the bar i can’t say what i want to say here—come in the parlour and shut the door  they followed the masterful lady obediently into the room indicated  and now mr robinson she said with her hands on her hips now for your explanation  i have explained to matilda said flower waving his hand  that’s quite right mar said miss tipping nodding briskly  he’s had a dreadful time poor feller said dick tipping unctuously he’s been hunted all over england by—who was it mister robinson  the parties i’m working against said flower repressing his choler by a strong effort  the parties he’s working against repeated mr tipping  somebody ought to talk to them parties said mr porson speaking with much deliberation that is if they can find ’em  they want looking after that’s what they want said dick tipping with a leer  it’s all very well for you to make fun of it said mrs tipping raising her voice i like plain straightforward dealing folk myself i don’t understand nothing about your secret services and governments and all that sort of thing mr robinson have you come back prepared to marry my daughter because if you ain’t we want to know why not  of course i have said flower hotly it’s the dearest wish of my life i should have come before only i thought when she didn’t answer my letter that she had given me up  where ’ave you been and what’s it all about demanded mrs tipping  at present said flower with an appearance of great firmness i can’t tell you i shall tell matilda the day after we’re married—if she’ll still trust me and marry me—and you shall all know as soon as we think it’s safe  you needn’t say another word mar said miss tipping warningly  i’m sure said the elder lady bridling perhaps your uncle would like to try and reason with you  mr porson smiled in a sickly fashion and cleared his throat  you see my dear— he began  your tie’s all shifted to one side said his niece sternly and the stud’s out of your buttonhole i wish you’d be a little tidier when you come here uncle it looks bad for the house  i came away in a hurry to oblige you said mr porson i don’t think this is a time to talk about buttonholes  i thought you were going to say something retorted miss tipping scathingly and you might as well talk about that as anything else  it ain’t right said mrs tipping breaking in that you should marry a man you don’t know anything about that’s what i mean that’s only reasonable i think  it’s quite fair said flower trying hard to speak reluctantly of course if matilda wishes i’m quite prepared to go away now i don’t wish her to tie herself up to a man who at present at any rate has to go about wrapped in a mystery  all the same said mrs tipping with a gleam in her eyes i’m not going to have anybody playing fast and loose with my daughter she’s got your ring on her finger you’re engaged to be married to her and you mustn’t break it off by running away or anything of that kind if she likes to break it off that’s a different matter  i’m not going to break it off said miss tipping fiercely i’ve made all the arrangements in my own mind we shall get married as soon as we can and i shall put dick in here as manager and take a nice little inn down in the country somewhere  mark my words said mrs tipping solemnly you’ll lose him again  if i lose him again said miss tipping dramatically if he’s spirited away by these people or anything happens to him dick won’t be manager here uncle porson will have as much drink and as many cigars as he pays for and charlie will find another berth  nobody shall hurt a hair of his head said mr tipping with inimitable pathos  he must be protected against hisself said mr porson spitefully that’s the ’ardest part he’s a man what if ’e thinks it’s his dooty ’ll go away just as ’e did before  well if he gets away from charlie said mr tipping he’ll be cute there’s one thing mr robinson if you try to get away from those who love you and are looking after you there’ll be a fight first then there’ll be a police court fuss and then we shall find out what the government mean by it  captain flower sat down in an easy posture as though he intended a long stay and in a voice broken with emotion murmured something about home and rest and freedom from danger  that’s just it said mrs tipping here you are and here you’ll stay after you’re married it’ll be matilda’s affair and now let’s have some tea  first of all mar kiss fred said miss tipping who had been eyeing her parent closely  mrs tipping hesitated but the gallant captain putting a good face on it sprang up and passing his arm about her substantial waist saluted her after which as a sort of setoff he kissed miss tipping  i can only say he said truthfully that this kindness hurts me the day i’m married i’ll tell you all     chapter xiii     in happy ignorance that the late master of the foam had secured a suite of rooms at the blue posts hotel the late mate returned to london by train with a view of getting into communication with him as soon as possible the delay occasioned by his visit to bittlesea was not regretted mr fraser senior having at considerable trouble and expense arranged for him to take over the swallow at the end of the week  owing to this rise in his fortune he was in fairly good spirits despite the slur upon his character as he made his way down to the wharf the hands had knocked off work for the day and the crew of the schooner having finished their tea were sprawling in the bows smoking in such attitudes of unstudied grace as best suited the contours of their figures joe looked up as he approached and removing his pipe murmured something inaudible to his comrades  the mate’s down below sir said mr william green in reply to fraser i shall be pleased to fetch him  he walked aft and returned shortly followed by ben who standing stiffly before his predecessor listened calmly to his eager enquiry about his letter  no there’s been nothing for you he said slowly he had dropped the letter overboard as the simplest way of avoiding unpleasantness was you expecting one  fraser gazing blankly at him made no reply being indeed staggered by the thoroughness with which he imagined the wily flower was playing his part  he’s going to be lost his full six months that’s evident he thought in consternation he must have seen the way i should be affected it would serve him right to tell the whole thing right away to captain barber  if anything does come i’ll send it on to you said ben who had been watching him closely  thanks said fraser pondering and walked away with his eyes on the ground he called in at the office as he passed it the staff had gone but the letterrack which stood on the dusty littered mantelpiece was empty and he went into the street again  his programme for the evening thus suddenly arrested he walked slowly up tower hill into the minories wondering what to do with himself something masquerading as a conscience told him severely that he ought to keep his promise to the errant flower and go and visit poppy conscience without any masquerading at all told him he was a humbug and disclaimed the responsibility in the meantime he walked slowly in the direction of poplar and having at length made up a mind which had been indulging in civil war all the way turned up liston street and knocked at the wheelers’ door  a murmur of voices’ from the sittingroom stopped instantly a double knock was a rare occurrence on that door and was usually the prelude to the sudden disappearance of the fairer portion of the family while a small boy was told off to answer it under dire penalties if he officiated too soon  this evening however the ladies had made their toilet and the door was opened after a delay merely sufficient to enable them to try and guess the identity of the guest before the revelation poppy tyrell opened it and turned upon him eyes which showed the faintest trace of surprise  good evening said fraser holding out his hand  good evening said the girl  fine weather we’re having said the embarrassed exmate for june he added in justification of the remark  miss tyrell assented gravely and stood there waiting  it is probable that two members at least of the family would have been gratified by the disappearance of the caller then and there but that mr wheeler a man of great density and no tact whatever came bustling out into the passage and having shaken hands in a hearty fashion told him to put his hat on a nail and come in  no news of the cap’n i suppose he asked solemnly after fraser was comfortably seated  not a word was the reply  the dockforeman sighed and shook his head as he reflected on the instability of human affairs there’s no certainty about anything he said slowly only yesterday i was walking down the commercial road and i slipped orf the curb into the road before you could say jack robinson  nearly run over queried fraser  mr wheeler shook his head no he said quietly  well what of it enquired his son  it might just as well have been the edge of the dock as the curb that’s what i mean said mr wheeler with a gravity befitting his narrow escape  i’m alwis telling you not to walk on the edge father said his wife uneasily  the dockforeman smiled faintly dooty must be done he said in a firm voice i’m quite prepared my life’s insured and i’m on the club and some o’ the children are getting big now that’s a comfort  a feeling of depression settled on all present and augustus wheeler aged eight having gleaned from the conversation that his sire had received instructions which he intended promptly to obey to fall into the dock forthwith suddenly opened his mouth and gave vent to his affection and despair in a howl so terrible that the ornaments on the mantelpiece shook with it  don’t scold ’im said the dockforeman tenderly as mrs wheeler’s thin shrill voice entered into angry competition with the howl never mind gussie my boy never mind  this gentleness had no effect gussie continuing to roar with much ardour but watching out of the corner of one tearsuffused eye the efforts of his eldest sister to find her pocket  hold your noise and i’ll give you a ha’penny she said tartly  gussie caught his breath with a sob but kept steam up having on some similar occasions been treated with more diplomacy than honesty but today he got the halfpenny together with a penny from the visitor and having sold his concern in his father for three halfpence gloated triumphantly in a corner over his envious peers  death said mr wheeler slowly after silence had been restored is always sudden the most sudden death i knew ’appened to a man who’d been dying for seven years nobody seemed to be able to believe he’d gone at last  it’s a good job he wasn’t married said mrs wheeler raising herself on her elbow sailors ’ave no right to marry at all if i thought that one ’o my gals was goin’ to marry a sailor i don’t know what i shouldn’t do something steady on shore is the thing  i don’t know said the tactless mr wheeler i think if i was a gal i should like to marry a sailor there’s something romantic about them i often wish i’d been a sailor  then you wouldn’t ’ave ’ad me said the lady from the sofa grimly  mr wheeler sighed but whether at the thought of what he might have lost or what he had gained cannot be safely determined still in a morbid mood he relapsed into silence leaving fraser to glance anxiously to where poppy pale and pretty sat listening to the clumsy overtures of mr bob wheeler  i might ’ave ’ad two or three sailors if i’d liked continued mrs wheeler musingly but i wouldn’t  fraser murmured his admiration at her firmness  there was tom rogers ’e was the first said mrs wheeler you remember ’im father  chap with bow legs and a squint wasn’t he said the dockforeman anxious to please  i never saw ’im squint said his wife sharply then there was robert moore—he was number two i think  ’ad a wife a’ready said mr wheeler turning to the visitor ’e was a bright lot ’e was  i don’t know what they saw in me i’m sure said mrs wheeler with a little modest laugh it wasn’t my good looks i’m sure  you ’ad something better than good looks my dear said the dockforeman affectionately something what’s wore better  mrs wheeler turned on the sofa and detecting gussie in the act of using his mouth as a moneybox upbraided him shrilly and sent him into a corner she then brought sundry charges of omission and commission against the other children until the air was thick with denials and explanations in the midst of which fraser turned towards poppy  i want to have a few minutes’ talk with you miss tyrell he said nervously  the girl looked up at him yes she said gravely  i mean alone continued the other marvelling at his hardihood it’s private  he lowered his voice from a shout to its normal tone as emma wheeler in selfdefence opened the door and drove the small fry out  i’ve not got my rooms now said the girl quietly  well my dear— began the dockforeman  don’t interfere father said mrs wheeler somewhat sharply i’m sure mr fraser needn’t mind saying anything before us it’s nothing he’s ashamed of i’m sure  certainly not said fraser sternly but it’s quite private for all that will you put your hat on and come out a little way miss tyrell  that i’m sure she won’t said the energetic mrs wheeler she’s that particular she won’t even go out with bob and they’re like brother and sister almost will she bob  mr bob wheeler received the appeal somewhat sullenly and in a low voice requested his parent not to talk so much fraser watching poppy closely saw with some satisfaction a tinge of colour in her cheek and what in any other person he would have considered a very obstinate appearance about her shapely chin  i’ll get my hat on if you’ll wait a minute she said quietly  she rose and went upstairs and fraser with a cheerful glance at mrs wheeler entered into conversation with her husband about overside work in the docks until the door was pushed open a little to reveal miss tyrell ready for walking  they walked on for some little time in silence the sun had set and even in the close streets of poplar the evening air was cool and refreshing when this fact had thoroughly impressed itself on mr fraser’s mind he communicated it to miss tyrell  it’s very pleasant she answered briefly what was it you wanted to talk to me about  about a lot of things said fraser what a tremendous lot of children there are about here  miss tyrell coldly admitted an obvious fact and stepping out into the road to avoid spoiling a small maiden’s next move at hop scotch returned to the pavement to listen to a somewhat lengthy dissertation upon the game in question  what did you want to say to me she asked at length turning and regarding him  in the first place said fraser i wanted to tell you that though nothing has been heard of captain flower i feel certain in my own mind that he has not been drowned  miss tyrell shook her head slowly  then i ought to tell you that i have left the foam continued the other i think that there is some idea that i knocked flower overboard to get his place  the girl turned quickly and her face flushed how absurd she said indignantly and her manner softened  thank you said fraser if you don’t believe it i don’t care what anybody else thinks  miss tyrell looking straight in front of her stole a glance at this easily satisfied young man from the corner of her eye i should never expect to hear of you doing anything wicked she said fraser thanked her again warmly or venturesome added miss tyrell thoughtfully you’re not the kind  they walked on in silence indignant silence on the part of the exmate  then you are out of a berth said poppy not unkindly  fraser shook his head and explained and i told my father about you he added nervously he knew flower very well and he told me to say that he would be very pleased and proud if you would come down and stay with him at bittlesea for a time  no thank you said miss tyrell  the air would do you good persisted fraser you could come down by train or come down with me on the swallow next week  miss tyrell repeated her refusal i must stay in london and get something else to do she said quietly  what do you think of doing enquired fraser  anything i can get was the reply  and in the meantime—— he began nervously  in the meantime i’m living on the wheelers said the girl pressing her lips together that was what you were going to say wasn’t it  i was not going to say anything of the kind said fraser warmly i was not thinking of it  well it’s true said poppy defiantly  it isn’t true said fraser because you will pay them back  shall we turn back said the girl  fraser turned and walked beside her and glancing furtively at the pale proud face wondered how to proceed  i should be delighted if you would come to bittlesea he said earnestly and i’m sure if flower should ever turn up again he would say it was the best thing you could have done  thank you but i prefer to stay here was the reply and i don’t wish to be ungrateful but i wish that people would not trouble me with their charity  she walked on in silence with her face averted until they reached liston street and stopping at the door turned to bid him goodbye her face softened as she shook hands and in the depths of her dark eyes as they met his he fancied that he saw a little kindness then the door opened and before he could renew his invitation closed behind her as rapidly as mr bob wheeler could perform the feat     chapter xiv     when the tide is up and the sun shining seabridge has attractions which make the absence of visitors something of a marvel to the inhabitants a wandering artist or two locally known as painterchaps certainly visit it but as they usually select subjects for their canvases of which the progressive party of the town are heartily ashamed they are regarded as spies rather than visitors and are tolerated rather than welcomed to a citizen who has for a score of years regretted the decay of his town the spectacle of a stranger gloating over its ruins and perpetuating them on canvas is calculated to excite strong doubts as to his mental capacity and his fitness to be at large  on a summer’s evening when the tide is out and the high ground the other side of the river is assuming undefinable shadows the little town has other charms to the meditative man such life as there is is confined to the taverns and the two or three narrow little streets which comprise the town the treeplanted walk by the river is almost deserted and the last light of the dying day is reflected in the pools and mud left by the tide  captain nibletts slowly pacing along and smoking his pipe in the serenity of the evening felt these things dimly his gaze wandered from a shadowy barge crawling along in midchannel to the cheery red blind of boatman’s arms and then to the road in search of captain barber for whom he had been enquiring since the morning a stout lady stricken in years sat on a seat overlooking the river and the mariner with a courteous salutation besought her assistance  i’ve been looking for him myself said mrs banks breathlessly and now my elizabeth’s nowhere to be found she’s been out since two o’clock this afternoon  nibletts pointed up the road with his pipe i see her only ten minutes ago with young gibson he said slowly  which way was they going demanded the old lady rising  i don’t know said nibletts i don’t think they knew either an’ what’s more i don’t think they cared  the old lady resumed her seat and folding her hands in her lap gazed in a troubled fashion across the river until the figure of another woman coming along the walk brought her back to everyday affairs  why it’s mrs church said nibletts he’s nowhere to be found he shouted before she reached them  he said the widow slowly who  cap’n barber replied the mariner  oh indeed she said politely good evening mrs banks  mrs banks returned the courtesy it looks as though cap’n barber has run away she said with attempted jocularity  mrs church smiled a superior smile he is not far off she said quietly  resting i suppose said mrs banks with intent  mrs church took higher ground of course this sad affair has upset him terribly she said gravely his is a faithful nature and he can’t forget how is miss banks bearing up  mrs banks looking up suspiciously said wonderful considering and relapsed into silence until such time as her foe should give her an opening mrs church took a seat by her side and nibletts with a feeling of something strained in the atmosphere for which he could not account resumed his walk  he was nearly up to captain barber’s house when he saw a figure come out of the lane by the side and after glancing furtively in all directions make silently for the door the watching nibletts quickening his pace reached it at almost the same moment  mrs banks is looking for you he said as he followed him into the parlour  captain barber turned on him a weary eye but made no reply  and mrs church too at least i think so’ continued the other  cap’n nibletts said the old man slowly i ’ope you’ll never live long enough to be run arter in the way i’m run arter  the astonished mariner murmured humbly that he didn’t think it was at all likely and also that mrs nibletts would probably have a word or two to say in the matter  from the moment i get up to the moment i get to bed i’m run arter continued the hapless barber mrs church won’t let me go out of ’er sight if she can help it and mrs banks is as bad as she is while they was saying nice things to each other this morning in a nasty way i managed to slip out  well why not get rid o’ mrs church said the simple nibletts  rid o’ mrs church repeated captain barber aghast why don’t you get rid o’ your face nibletts he asked by way of comparison merely  because i don’t want to replied the other flushing  because you can’t said captain barber emphatically and no more can’t i get rid of ’er you see i ’appened to take a little notice of ’er  oh well said the other and sighed and shook his head discouragingly  i took a little notice of ’er repeated captain barber and then to spare her feelings i ’ad to sort o’ let ’er know that i could never marry for fred’s sake d’ye see then on top of all that poor fred goes and gets drownded  but have you promised to marry her asked nibletts with a cunning look  of course i’ve not rejoined captain barber testily but when you know as much about wimmen as i do you’ll know that that’s got nothing to do with it it gets took for granted mrs church’s whole manner to me now is that of a engaged young person if she was sitting here now she’d put ’er hand on top o’ mine  not before me said nibletts in a shocked voice  before the prince of wales and all the royal family replied captain barber with conviction you’ve no idea how silly and awkward it makes me feel  here she comes said nibletts in a low voice and mrs banks and her daughter too  captain barber coughed and sitting upright strove to look unconcerned as the three ladies came into the room and expressed their pleasure at seeing him  i couldn’t think what ’ad happened to you said mrs banks as she sank panting into a chair and unfastening her bonnetstrings sat regarding him with her hands on her knees  i knew he was all right said mrs church folding her hands and regarding him with her head on one side if anything happened to him i should know if he was a hundred miles away  she sat down by captain barber and laying her hand upon his pressed it affectionately the captain a picture of misery exchanged a significant glance with nibletts and emitted an involuntary groan  don’t take on so said mrs banks compassionately do you know i’ve got a feeling that poor fred has been saved  that’s my feeling too said captain barber in a firm voice  it’s very likely said captain nibletts slowly  what’s easier than for him to have been picked up by a passing vessel and carried off goodness knows where enquired mrs banks with a glance evenly distributed between her daughter and the housekeeper  i heard of a man once who fell overboard said captain nibletts softly and he turned up safe and sound twenty years arter  married man enquired miss banks softly  he was said the captain with the doggedness of a witness under crossexamination  mrs church turned her eyes upwards fancy the joyful meeting of husband and wife she said sentimentally  she died just two days afore he turned up said captain nibletts simply  there was a frigid silence during which the three ladies sinking for a time their differences eyed him with every sign of strong disapprobation mrs banks giving vent to a sniff which disparaged the whole race of man  as for men who fall overboard and get picked up and turn up months afterwards continued the faithful nibletts why every sailorman knows scores of ’em  i knowed seven said captain barber with the exactness of untruth they didn’t seem to think much of it didn’t seem to think it anything unusual i mean  it ain’t said nibletts stoutly  the room relapsed into silence and captain nibletts finding mrs church’s gaze somewhat trying got up to admire a beautiful oil painting on glass in a black frame which hung over the mantelpiece and after a few encomiums on his host’s taste bade him goodbye  i’m coming with you said barber rising i’ve got some business to talk about  what out again said mrs church tenderly after being on your poor feet all day  captain barber murmured something inaudible in reply and taking his hat from the sideboard went out with nibletts for a time they trudged along in silence until the latter who wanted to go to his own home ventured to ask where they were going  all places are alike to me replied the old man dismally i only want to get away that’s all she an’ mrs banks are sure to have a turn and try and drag me into it  he clasped his hands behind his back and pausing at a turn of the road looked down upon the little quay below out in the river two or three small craft rode at anchor while a bauble of cheerful voices from a distant boat only served to emphasise the stillness of the evening  looks quiet said captain nibletts after watching him for some time  i’m thinking of my nevy said captain barber slowly i remember me an’ my sister bringing ’im here when he was three year old and i ’ad to carry him all the way back he put his arms round my neck and i can smell peppermintball now  captain nibletts who did not quite follow him attributed the outrage to a young couple who had just passed  i’m all alone now continued captain barber unheeding but i don’t want to marry why not ’cos i’m too old and because it’s like beginning where other people leave off  well make up your mind and tell her so said the other  it wouldn’t do any good said barber dolefully  tell her tonight said nibletts come into the thorn and have a glass just so as to warm you up to it and then get it over  captain barber made no reply but turning round led the way slowly back to the inn and after acknowledging the respectful salutations of the crew of the schooner who were in the bar by ordering the landlady to fill their pots again led the way into the parlour and began to charge himself for the interview  that he did not underestimate the difficulties of the ordeal was evident by the extent of his orders and captain nibletts noted with satisfaction as the evening wore on that the old man’s spirits were improving considerably twice he sent out instructions to the bar to have the men’s mugs replenished a proceeding which led to mr william green being sent by the grateful crew to express their feelings in a neat little speech  a very nicespoken young fellow said captain barber approvingly  he had some more whisky and at the sounds of a stepdance on the brick floor of the adjoining taproom took up his glass and followed by nibletts watched the proceedings from the doorway mr william green who worshipped wealth and position sidled up to him and with much deference discussed the dancing  he made such a favourable impression that captain barber who was in a semimaudlin mood took him by the arm to the now deserted parlour and ensconcing him in a corner told him all his troubles and warned him of the pitfalls which beset the feet of goodlooking bachelors mr green was sympathy itself and for some time sat silently evolving various schemes for the deliverance of his patron  captain nibletts returning to the parlour a little later found them in close consultation a ray of hope illuminated the somewhat heavy features of the old man and catching sight of the captain he beckoned him to his side  me an’ this young man have thought of something he said in a voice rendered husky with excitement  nibletts waited  he’s goin’ to call at my place continued the other and tell mrs church that i’ve been took unwell at the cauliflower at mapleden and want to see her and he’s to bring her there at once arter they’ve started i go in and get to bed and earthquakes wouldn’t wake me let alone a knock at the door d’ye see  what good’s that goin’ to do enquired the astonished listener  next day said barber in thrilling tones as he placed his forefinger on the other’s arm i refuse to believe her story green here denies of it too and sez ’e saw her at the gate and asked her to go for a walk with him  captain nibletts fingered his beard it don’t seem to be the sort of trick to play on a woman he expostulated an’ it’s four miles to mapleden what’s she goin’ to do  that’s ’er lookout observed captain barber with much composure all i know is she won’t wake me i daresay she’ll come on to your place wimmen wot sets their caps at men wot don’t want ’em set at ’em must put up with the consequences  you give me half an hour sir said mr green impressively and then you can come on as soon as you like you’ll find the coast clear by then  he bit off the end of the cigar presented by captain barber and thanking him effusively as he struck a match for him quitted the inn the two captains waited restlessly for the time specified and then finishing their drinks went outside and standing in the light which streamed from the windows and doorway of the thorn gazed at the dark road beyond  it looks all right said barber shaking hands goodnight  good luck said nibletts  the other not without a little trepidation walked towards his house and opening the door after a little difficulty stood safely inside the house was quiet and in darkness except for the lamp which stood on the parlourtable and after a moment’s survey he proceeded to shut up for the night  as a rule he was careless about such matters but tonight no gaoler saw to his bolts and bars more carefully than he did he returned to the parlour having made all secure and lighting his pipe for a few final whiffs before retiring winked at himself solemnly in the glass then fearful that the housekeeper might return sooner than was expected he blew out the lamp and smoked in the dark  he knocked out his pipe at last and walked slowly and ponderously upstairs he grinned again as he passed the door of the housekeeper’s room and then with a catch in his breath clutched heavily at the banister as a soft female voice bade him goodnight  captain barber surprised beyond all measure was unable to speak  i thought you’d got lost again said the voice playfully goodnight  goodnight rejoined the other in hollow tones mrs banks stay long he enquired pausing at his door  she went just about half an hour before you came in replied the housekeeper elizabeth went soon after you did but her mother stopped on she went very suddenly when she did go and was very mysterious about it not that i want to know her business  mysterious faltered the captain  some young man came to the door continued the innocent woman and they were talking in a low voice i don’t know who it was because mrs banks let me see quite plainly that she didn’t want me to know then she just called out ’goodnight’ and went off as fast as you please  captain barber supported himself for a moment by the handle of his door and then in a dazed way blundered into his room he was a goodhearted man in a way and pushing open the little casement he thrust out his head and sighed with genuine feeling as he thought of his poor old friend plodding slowly to mapleden incidentally he felt a little bit sorry for mr william green  he was awaked next morning after a somewhat restless night by the sounds of an unwonted noise downstairs and lay in amazement listening to a hum of excited voices below knuckles rapped on his door and the voice of mrs church much agitated requested him to rise and attire himself  he was out of bed at that and looking from the window a small group of children stood in the road outside the house while joe and the cook with their arms on the fence were staring hard at his parlour window occasionally varying the proceedings by a little conversation with the people next door who were standing in their front garden in a state of considerable agitation he hurriedly dressed himself and went downstairs  his sittingroom was full mrs banks looking very tired was sitting in the armchair taking smellingsalts at intervals and staring fiercely at mr william green who was huddled in a corner smiling sheepishly behind captain nibletts and ben  what’s all this demanded captain barber in a trembling voice as his eye met mr green’s  several of mrs banks’s relatives began speaking at once assisted by some of the neighbours the substance of their remarks was that a man whose polite tongue hid the falseness of his heart had lured mrs banks for a fourmile walk to mapleden late the preceding night under the pretence that captain barber who was evidently hale and hearty was lying ill at the cauliflower they demanded his immediate dismissal from the ship and his exemplary punishment by the law  what ’ave you got to say to this demanded captain barber of the villain in tones of righteous indignation tempered by fear  it isn’t true sir said mr green respectfully i didn’t say anything of the kind  wot did you say then enquired captain barber in a voice which the company thought far too mild for the occasion  she was standing at the door as i passed said mr green nervously and i asked her to go for a walk with me  lawkamussy me screamed the horrified mrs banks  we went for a nice little stroll continued the graceless mr green and then i s’pose she found it was later than she thought and she began to make a fuss  me at my time o’ life demanded the indignant mrs banks of the audience  you did make a fuss said mr green  o’ course i made a fuss when i found out how i had been deceived you were here when he came mrs church weren’t you  i would rather not say anything about it said the housekeeper freezingly  i insist upon your speaking said the old lady getting very red in the face  well i don’t know much about it said the housekeeper looking round appealingly i heard you speaking to somebody at the door in a low voice  it wasn’t a low voice interrupted mrs banks sharply  well i couldn’t hear what you were saying and then when you went outside and i asked you whether you were going home you said ’yes’ didn’t you  are you sure she said she was going home said mrs banks’s brotherinlaw in an awful voice as the old lady sank back in her chair  yes said mrs church with a fine show of reluctance  there was a dead silence during which they all heard the smellingsalts drop  if this man said captain barber was ill at mapleden why didn’t you tell me continued mrs church in a mildly aggrieved voice i think if anybody ought to have known it should have been me  it’s all a fuss about nothing said mr green brazenly she stayed out a bit too late and then wanted to put it all on to me  a good samaritan picked up the smellingsalts and held them to the victim’s nose while her scandalized relatives discussed the situation in hurried whispers the brotherinlaw eyed her with bewildered disapproval and in the disjointed accents peculiar to surprise was heard to make use of the words friskiness and gallivanting and old enough to know better  her relatives’ remarks however caused mrs banks comparatively little pain her attention was fully taken up by the housekeeper in whose satisfied smile she saw a perfect recognition of the reasons for her action of the previous evening she got up from her chair and with a stateliness which her brotherinlaw thought somewhat misplaced took her daughter’s arm and slowly left the room her departure being the signal for a general breakup by twos and threes the company drifted slowly up the road in her wake while captain barber going in the other direction accompanied captain nibletts and party as far as the schooner in order that he might have the opportunity of saying a few wellchosen words to mr green on the subject of precipitancy  if it ’adn’t been for me tipping ’im the wink so as to let him know what line ’e was to go on when i came down where should i ’ave been he demanded of captain nibletts  and that astonished mariner with a helpless shake of his head gave it up     chapter xv     the blue posts chelsea is an oldtime publichouse pleasantly situated by the river with an extensive connection amongst gentlemen’s servants ’busmen and other skilled judges of good beer the subtle and delicate perfume of which liquor pervades the place from cellar to basement and has more than once taken the policeman on duty to the back door under the impression that something wanted looking into  to some men imprisonment in such a place would have been little short of ecstasy in the heat of summer they would have sat in the cool cellar amid barrels of honest beer in winter they would have led the conversation cosily seated around the taproom fire for exercise profitable employment at the beerengine in the bar for intellectual exercise the study of practical chemistry in the cellar  to captain fred flower none of these things appealed he had visited the cellar certainly—in search of subterranean exits he had sat in the taproom—close to the open window but his rabid desire to get away from the place and never see it again could not have been surpassed by the most bitter teetotaler that ever breathed  his greatest trouble was with porson whose limpetlike qualities were a source of neverfailing concern to the unfortunate mariner did he ascend to the drawingroom and gaze yearningly from the windows at the broad stream of father thames and the craft dropping down on the ebbtide to the sea uncle porson sallow of face and unclean of collar was there to talk beery romance of the ocean did he retire to the small yard at the rear of the premises and gaze from the back door at the passing life of a chelsea bystreet uncle porson was looking over his shoulder pointing out milkmen with histories and cabmen with a past  the second week of his stay was drawing to a close before he fully realised the horror of his position his foot which had been giving him considerable trouble was getting much better though it was by no means well enough to give him a chance in a footrace with mr porson or charles and as the family at the blue posts realised the improvement the attentions of his personal attendants were redoubled the key of his bedroom door was turned every night after he had retired a discovery he had made the first night after carefully dressing for flight and spending an hour over the composition of a farewell note to miss tipping there was no chance of reaching the roof from his bedroom window and the pavement below offered him his choice between a wedding and a funeral  and amid all this the fiction was maintained of preserving him from his lawless foes and his own inconvenient devotion to duty a struggle for escape was not to be thought of as the full measure of his deceitfulness would transpire in the event of failure and the wedding drew nearer day by day while his active brain was still casting about in vain for any means of escape  next tuesday said mrs tipping to her stepdaughter as they sat in the much decorated drawingroom one afternoon you’ll be mrs robinson  miss tipping who was sitting next to the skipper looked at him languishingly and put her head on his shoulder  i can hardly believe it she said coyly  flower who was in the same predicament patted her head tenderly as being easier than replying  and i must say said mrs tipping regarding the pair i’m a plain woman and i speak my mind that if it was me i should want to know more about him first  i’m quite satisfied mar said miss tipping without raising her head  there’s your relations to be satisfied matilda said uncle porson in an important voice  miss tipping raised her head and favoured the interrupter with a baleful stare whereupon mr porson scratching his neck feebly glanced at mrs tipping for support  our relations needn’t come to see us said his niece at length he’s marrying me not my relations  he’s making me his uncle at any rate said mr porson with a sudden access of dignity  you don’t mind fred do you asked miss tipping anxiously  i’d put up with more than that for your sake said flower i needn’t tell people  that’s all very fine said mrs tipping taking up the cudgels for the speechless and glaring victim of these pleasantries but there’s no mystery about your uncle everybody knows him he doesn’t disappear just as he is going to get married and be brought back in a cab months afterwards he isn’t full of secrets he mustn’t tell people who ought to know  never kep’ a secret in my life agreed uncle porson whose head was buzzing under this unaccustomed praise  i know quite eno’ugh about fred said miss tipping tenderly when i want your opinion mar i’ll ask you for it  mrs tipping’s reply was interrupted by the entrance of a young man from the jeweller’s with four brooches for flower to present to the bridesmaids mrs tipping had chosen them and it did not take the hapless skipper long to arrive at the conclusion that she was far fonder of bridesmaids than he was his stock of money was beginning to dwindle and the purchase of a second wedding suit within a month was beginning to tell even upon his soaring spirits  there’s another thing about fred i don’t quite like said mrs tipping as she sat with the brooches ranged upon her capacious lap he’s extravagant i don’t like a mean man but one who flings his money away is almost as bad these ’ere brooches are very pretty and they do him credit but i can’t say but what something cheaper wouldn’t ’ave done as well  i thought you liked them said the indignant flower  i like them well enough said mrs tipping solemnly there’s nothing to dislike in them seems to me they must have cost a lot of money that’s all—i suppose i may make a remark  flower changed the subject and turning to miss tipping began to speak in a low voice of their new home miss tipping wanted a sort of eden with bar improvements and it was rather difficult to find  they had discussed the matter before and the wily skipper had almost quarrelled with his brideelect over the part of the country in which they were to live miss tipping holding out for the east coast while flower hotly championed the south mrs tipping with some emphasis had suggested leaving it until after the honeymoon but a poetic advertisement of an inn in essex catching her daughter’s eye it was decided that instant inspection should be made  they travelled down from fenchurch street accompanied by dick and mrs tipping the skipper who was painfully on the alert for any chance of escape making a great fuss of his foot and confessing to a feeling of unusual indisposition he sat in one corner of the carriage with his eyes half closed while miss tipping with her arm affectionately drawn through his was the unconscious means of preventing a dash for liberty as the train steamed slowly through a station  the nearest station to the rose of essex was five miles distant a fact which owing perhaps to the expensive nature of newspaper charges did not appear in the advertisement  it’s a nice little place said the landlady of the railway hotel as they asked her opinion over lunch there’s a little land goes with it if you want to drive over i’d better be having something got ready  mrs tipping who halved the duties with flower she doing the ordering and he the paying assented and in a short time they were bowling rapidly along through narrow country lanes to their destination the skipper noticed with pleasure the lonely nature of the country and his heart beat fast as he thought of the chances of success of a little plan of escape  so far as appearance went the inn was excellent roses clustered round the porch and hung in fragrant bunches from the walls while three or four sturdy lime trees in one corner threw a grateful shade over a rustic table and settles flower with a grateful sigh said that it was the very thing even mrs tipping after a careful inspection said that they might do worse dick with an air of professional gravity devoted most of his attention to the cellar while the engaged couple walked slowly round the immense garden in the rear exchanging tender whispers  we’ll think it over and let you know said mrs tipping to the landlord  there’s been a lot after it said he slowly with a glance at his wife  and yet it ain’t gone said the businesslike mrs tipping pleasantly  i’m going to take it mar said miss tipping firmly  mrs tipping sighed at her haste but finding her determined went down the cellar again accompanied by dick for a last look round captain flower leaning heavily on miss tipping’s arm limped slowly to the carriage  tired she enquired tenderly as he sank back in the cushions  foot’s painful he said with a faint smile good gracious  what’s the matter asked miss tipping alarmed by his manner  i’ve left my pipe in the garden said flower rising the one you gave me i wouldn’t lose it for the world  i’ll get it said miss tipping springing out of the carriage whereabouts did you leave it do you think  by the beehives said flower pale with excitement as he heard mrs tipping and dick coming up from the cellar make haste somebody might take it  miss tipping darted into the house and immediately afterwards the tippings ascended from the cellar attended by the landlady  driver said flower sharply  sir said the man looking round and tenderly rubbing his back  take that to the lady who has just gone in at once gabbled flower hurry up  for want of anything better he handed the astonished driver his tobaccopouch and waved him to the house the lad descended from his perch and ran to the door just as dick tipping giving vent to a sharp cry was rushing out the cry acted on the skipper like magic and snatching up the whip he gave the horse a cut in which was concentrated the fears of the last fortnight and the hopes of his future lifetime  the animal sprang forward madly just as dick tipping who had pushed the driver out of the way rushed out in pursuit there was a hard white road in front and it took it at a gallop the vehicle rocking from side to side behind it as flower played on it with the whip tipping was close behind and the driver a good second flower leaving the horse to take care of itself for a time stood upright in the carriage and hurled cushions at his foremost pursuer the third cushion was long and limp and falling on end in front of him twined itself round his swiftmoving legs and brought him heavily to the ground  he’s winded said flower as he saw the coachman stop and help the other man slowly to his feet shows what a cushion can do  he clambered onto the seat as a bend in the road shut the others from his sight and gathering up the reins gave himself over to the joyous feeling of his newfound liberty as they rushed through the air his ideas of driving were elementary and his mode of turning corners was to turn them quickly and get it over but he drove on for miles without mishap and the horse having dropped to a steady trot began to consider his future movements  they’ll be setting the wires to work i expect he thought soberly what a comfortable old world this must have been before they invented steam and telegraph i’ll go a little bit farther and then tie it up to a tree  he made what he considered an endearing noise with his mouth and the startled animal at once bounded forward with the intention of getting out of hearing a gentle incline favoured the pace which was now so considerable that the skipper seeing another craft approaching him waved his hand towards it warningly  i wonder who ought to get out of the way he said thoughtfullly i s’pose the horse knows  he left it to that able quadruped after giving it a little bang on the flank with the butt end of the whip to keep its faculties fresh there was a frenzied shout from the other vehicle a sudden violent stoppage with the crashing of wood and flower crawling out of the ditch watched with some admiration the strenuous efforts of his noble beast to take the carriage along on three wheels  look what you’ve done roared the driver of the other vehicle foaming with passion as he jumped out and held his plunging horse by the head look at my gig sir look at it  flower looked and then returned the courtesy  look at mine he said impressively mine’s much the worst  you were on the wrong side of the road shouted the other  i was there first said flower it wouldn’t have happened if you hadn’t tried to get out of my way the course i was on i should have passed you easily  he looked up the road his horse trembling violently was standing still with the wreck of the carriage behind it he stooped mechanically and picking up the whip which was lying in the road said that he would go off for assistance  you stay here sir said the other man with an oath  i won’t said the skipper  his adversary made no reply but having by this time soothed his frightened horse took his whip out of its socket and strode towards him with the butt raised over his head flower arranged his own whip the same way and both men being new to the weapon circled round each other two or three times waiting for a little instruction then the owner of the gig whose temper was rising every second ran in and dealt the skipper a heavy blow on the head  the blow dispelled an idea which was slowly forming there of asking the extent of the damage and if it were not too much offering to make it good ideas of settlement vanished ideas of honour morality and even escape vanished too all merged in the one fixed idea of giving the other man a harder blow than he had given  for a minute or two the battle raged fairly equally both were securing a fair amount of punishment then under a heavy blow from flower his foe went down suddenly for a second or two the skipper held his breath with fear then the other man raised himself feebly on his knees and throwing away his whip staggered to his feet and unfastening the reins clambered unsteadily into his gig and drove off without a word  the victorious skipper looked up and down the lonely road and shaking his head sadly at the noble steed which had brought him into this mess tenderly felt his bruised and aching head and then set off as fast as his foot would permit up the road  he looked about eagerly as he went for a place of concealment fully aware of the inability of a lame shipmaster to outdistance horseflesh hedges and fields bounded both sides of the road but half a mile farther along on the righthand side the field stretched away upwards to meet a wood towards this wood captain flower having first squeezed himself through a gap in the hedge progressed with all speed  he sat on the trunk of a fallen pine to regain his breath and eagerly looked about him to his disappointment he saw that the wood was of no great depth but was a mere belt of pines running almost parallel with the road he had quitted with the single idea of getting as far away from the scene of his crime as possible he began to walk through it  the wood was very still and the shade grateful after the heat of the sun just beyond the fields were shimmering in the heat and he pricked up his ears as the unmistakable sound of wheels and hoofs came across the silent fields he looked round wildly and seeing a tiny cottage standing in a bit of a clearing made towards it  a little old man twisted with rheumatism rose as he stood at the open door and regarded him with a pair of bloodshot but sharp old eyes while an old woman sitting in a windsorchair looked up anxiously  can i come in asked flower  aye said the old man standing aside to let him pass  hot day said the skipper taking a seat  no ’tain’t said the old man  not so hot as yesterday said flower with a conciliatory smile  it’s ’otter than it was yesterday said the old man what ha’ you done to your face  i was climbing a tree said flower with a laugh and i fell down i’ve hurt my foot too  served you right if you’d broke your neck said his amiable host climbing trees at your time o’ life  nice cottage you’ve got here said the persistent flower  i wish you ’ad to live in it said the old man  he took a proffered cigar and after eyeing it for some time like a young carver with a new joint took out a huge claspknife and slowly sawed the end off  can i sleep here for the night asked flower at length  no you can’t said the old man drawing at his cigar  he smoked on with the air of a man who has just given a very clever answer to a very difficult question  we ain’t on’y got one room besides this said the old woman solemnly years ago we used to have four and a washplace  oh i could sleep on the floor here said flower lightly i’ll pay you five shillings  let’s see your money said the old man leaning forward  flower put the sum in his hand i’ll pay now he said heartily  the floor won’t run away said the other pulling out an old leathern purse and you can sleep on any part of it you like  flower thanked him effusively he was listening intently for any sounds outside if the tippings and the man in the gig met they would scour the countryside and almost certainly pay the cottage a visit  if you let me go upstairs and lie down for an hour or two he said turning to the old man i’ll give you another halfcrown  the old man said nothing but held out his hand and after receiving the sum got up slowly and opening a door by the fireplace revealed a few broken stairs which he slowly ascended after beckoning his guest to follow  it’s a small place he said tersely but i daresay you’ve often slept in a worse  flower made no reply he was looking from the tiny casement through an opening in the trees he saw a couple of figures crossing the field towards the wood  if anybody asks you whether you have seen me say no he said rapidly to the old man i’ve got into a bit of a mess and if you hide me here until it has blown over i’ll make it worth your while  how much said the old man  flower hesitated five pounds for certain he said hastily and more if you’re put to much trouble run down and stop your wife’s mouth quietly  don’t order me about said the old man slowly i ain’t said i’ll do it yet  they’re coming now said flower impatiently mind if they catch me you lose your five pounds  all right said the other i’m doing it for the five pounds mind not for you added this excellent man  he went grunting and groaning down the narrow stairs and the skipper closing the door went and crouched down by the open casement a few indistinct words were borne in on the still air and voices came gradually closer until footsteps which had been deadened by the grass became suddenly audible on the stones outside the cottage  flower held his breath with anxiety then he smiled softly and pleasantly as he listened to the terms in which his somewhat difficult host was addressed  now gaffer said the man of the gig roughly  wake up grandpa said dick tipping have you seen a man go by here—blue serge suit moustache face and head knocked about  no i ain’t seen ’im was the reply what’s he done  tipping told him briefly we’ll have him he said savagely we’ve got a mounted policeman on the job besides others if you can catch him it’s worth half a sov to you  he went off hurriedly with the other man and their voices died away in the distance flower sat in his place on the floor for some time and then seeing from the window that the coast was clear went downstairs again  the old woman made him up a bed on the floor after supper although both he and the old man assured her that it was unnecessary and then taking the lamp bade him goodnight and went upstairs  flower left to himself rolled exultingly on his poor couch and for the first time in a fortnight breathed freely  if i do get into trouble he murmured complacently i generally manage to get out of it it wants a good head in the first place and a cool one in the second     chapter xvi     he was awake early in the morning and opening the door stood delightedly breathing the fresh pinescented air  the atmosphere of the blue posts was already half forgotten and he stood looking dreamily forward to the time when he might reasonably return to life and poppy he took a few steps into the wood and after feeling for his pipe before he remembered that miss tipping was probably keeping it as a souvenir sat on a freshlycut log and fell into a sentimental reverie until the appearance of a restless old man at the door of the cottage took him back to breakfast  i thought you’d run off said his host tartly  you thought wrong then said flower sharply as he took out his purse here are two of the five pounds i promised you i’ll give you the rest when i go  the old man took the money and closed his small hard mouth until the lips almost disappeared more money than sense he remarked cordially as the skipper replaced his purse  flower made no reply some slices of fat bacon were sizzling in a pan over the woodfire and the pungent smell of the woods mixed with the sharpness of the morning air gave him an appetite to which since his enforced idleness he had been a stranger he drew his chair up to the rickety little table with its covering of frayed oilcloth and breaking a couple of eggs over his bacon set to eagerly  don’t get eggs like these in london he said to the old woman  the old woman leaned over and inspecting the shells paid a tribute to the hens who were responsible for them and traced back a genealogy which would have baffled the entire college of heralds—a genealogy hotly contested by the old man who claimed a bar sinister through three eggs bought at the village shop some generations before  you’ve got a nice little place here said flower by way of changing the conversation which was well on the way to becoming personal but don’t you find it rather dull sometimes  well i don’t know said the old woman i finds plenty to do and ’e potters about like ’e don’t do much but it pleases ’im and it don’t hurt me  the object of these compliments took them as a matter of course and after hunting up the stump of last night’s cigar and shredding it with his knife crammed it into a clay pipe and smoked tranquilly flower found a solitary cigar one of the blue posts’ best and with a gaze which wandered idly from the chest of drawers on one side of the room to the old china dogs on the little mantelshelf on the other smoked in silence  the old man brought in news at dinnertime the village was ringing with the news of yesterday’s affair and a rigourous search fanned into excitement by an offer of two pounds reward was taking the place of the more prosaic labours of the country side  if it wasn’t for me said the old man in an excess of selflaudation you’d be put in the gaol—where you ought to be but i wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t for the five pounds you’d better keep close in the house there’s some more of ’em in the wood looking for you  captain flower took his advice and for the next two days became a voluntary prisoner on the third day the old man reported that public excitement about him was dying out owing partly to the fact that it thought the villain must have made his escape good and partly to the fact that the landlord of the wheatsheaf had been sitting at his front door shooting at snakes on the king’s highway invisible to ordinary folk  the skipper resolved to make a start on the following evening walking the first night so as to get out of the dangerous zone and then training to london at the prospect his spirits rose and in a convivial mood he purchased a bottle of red currant wine from the old woman at supper and handed it round  he was still cheerful next morning as he arose and began to dress then he paused and in a somewhat anxious fashion patted his trousers pockets minute and painful investigation revealed a bunch of keys and a claspknife  he tried his other pockets and then sinking in a dazed fashion into a chair tried to think what had become of his purse and loose change his watch a silver one was under his pillow where he had placed it the night before and his ready cash was represented by the shilling which hung upon the chain  he completed his dressing slowly while walking about the room looking into all sorts of likely and unlikely hidingplaces for his money and at length gave up the search in disgust and sat down to wait until such time as his host should appear it was a complication for which he had not bargained and unable to endure the suspense any longer he put his head up the stairway and bawled to the old man to come down  what’s the matter now demanded the old man as he came downstairs preceded by his wife one would think the place belonged to you making all that noise  i’ve lost my purse said flower regarding him sternly my purse has been taken out of one pocket and some silver out of the other while i was asleep  the old man raised his eyebrows at his wife and scratched his chin roughly  i s’pose you’ve lost my three pounds along with it he said raspily  where’s my purse demanded the skipper roughly don’t play the fool with me it won’t pay  i don’t know nothing about your purse said the other regarding him closely with his little bloodshot eyes you’re trying to do me out o’my three pounds—me what’s took you in and ’id you  the incensed skipper made no reply but passing upstairs turned the bedroom topsyturvy in a wild search for his property it was unsuccessful and he came down with a look in his face which made his respected host get close to his wife  are you going to give me my money demanded he striding up to him  i’ve not got your money snarled the other i’m an honest man  he started back in alarm and his wife gave a faint scream as flower caught him by the collar and holding him against the wall went through his pockets  don’t hurt him cried the old woman he’s only a little old man  if you were younger and bigger said the infuriated skipper as he gave up the fruitless search i’d thrash you till you gave it up  i’m an honest man said the other recovering himself as he saw that his adversary intended no violence if you think i’ve stole your money you know what you can do  what demanded flower  go to the police said the old man his little slit of a mouth twisted into a baleful grin if you think i’ve stole your money go and tell the police  let ’em come and search the house said the old woman plucking up spirit i’ve been married fortytwo years and ’ad seven children go and fetch the police  flower stared at them in wrathful concern threats were of no use and violence was out of the question he went to the door and leaning against it stood there deep in thought until after a time the old woman taking courage from his silence began to prepare breakfast then he turned and drawing his chair up to the table ate silently  he preserved this silence all day despite the occasional suggestion of the old man that he should go for the police and the aggrieved refrain of the old woman as to the length of her married life and the number of her offspring  he left at night without a word the old man smiled almost amiably to see him go and the old woman who had been in a state of nervous trepidation all day glanced at her husband with a look in which wifely devotion and admiration were almost equally blended  flower passed slowly through the wood and after pausing to make sure that he was not followed struck across the fields and with his sailor’s knowledge of the stars steered by them in the direction of london  he walked all that night unmolested his foot giving him but little trouble and passed the following day under a haystack assuaging his hunger with some bread and cheese he had put in his pocket  travelling by night and sleeping in secluded spots by day he reached the city in three days considering that he had no money and was afraid to go into a town to pawn his watch he did not suffer so much from hunger as might have been expected—something which he vaguely referred to as providence but for which the sufferers found other terms twice leading his faltering footsteps to labourers’ dinners in tin cans and red handkerchiefs  at stratford he pawned his watch and chain and sat down to a lengthy meal and then with nearly eighteen shillings in his pocket took train to liverpool street the roar of the city greeted his ears like music and investing in a pipe and tobacco he got on a ’bus bound eastward and securing cheap apartments in the mile end road sat down to consider his plans the prompt appearance of the tipping family after his letter to fraser had given him a wholesome dread of the post and until the connection between the two was satisfactorily explained he would not risk another even in his new name of thompson having come to this decision he had another supper and then went upstairs to the unwonted luxury of a bed     chapter xvii     it is one of the first laws of domestic economy that the largest families must inhabit the smallest houses—a state of things which is somewhat awkward when the heads wish to discuss affairs of state some preserve a certain amount of secrecy by the use of fragmentary sentences eked out by nods and blinks and by the substitution of capital letters for surnames a practice likely to lead to much confusion and scandal when the names of several friends begin with the same letter others improve the family orthography to an extent they little dream of by spelling certain vital words instead of pronouncing them some children profiting so much by this form of vicarious instruction that they have been known to close a most interesting conversation by thoughtlessly correcting their parents on a point of spelling  there were but few secrets in the wheeler family the younger members relating each other’s misdeeds quite freely and refuting the charge of talebearing by keeping debit and credit accounts with each other in which assets and liabilities could usually be balanced by simple addition among the elders the possession of a present secret merely meant a future conversation  on this day the juniors were quite certain that secret proceedings of a highly interesting nature were in the air miss tyrell having been out since the morning mrs wheeler was looking forward anxiously to her return with the view of holding a little private conversation with her and the entire wheeler family were no less anxious to act as audience for the occasion mr bob wheeler had departed to his work that morning in a condition which his family who were fond of homely similes had likened to a bear with a sore head the sisterly attentions of emma wheeler were met with a boorish request to keep her paws off and a young wheeler rash and inexperienced in the way of this weary world who publicly asked what bob had got the hump about was sternly ordered to finish his breakfast in the washhouse consequently there was a full meeting after tea and when poppy entered it was confidently expected that proceedings would at once open with a speech from the sofa  take the children outside a bit belinda said her mother after the tea things had been removed  got my ’ome lessons to do said belinda  do ’em when you come back said mrs wheeler  sha’n’t ’ave time replied belinda taking her books from a shelf they’ll take me all the evening we’ve all got a lot of ’ome lessons tonight  never mind you take ’em out persisted mrs wheeler  when i want to go out said belinda rebelliously you won’t let me  do as your mother tells you commanded mr wheeler with excellent sternness  i want a little quiet said mrs wheeler a little fresh air will do you good peter  i’ll go and smoke my pipe in the washhouse said mr wheeler who had his own notions of healthful recreation  take your pipe outside said mrs wheeler significantly did you ’ear what i said belinda  belinda rose noisily and gathering up her untidy books thrust them back in a heap on the shelf and putting on her hat stood at the door commenting undutifully upon her parents and shrilly demanding of the small wheelers whether they were coming or whether she was to stay there all night she also indulged in dreary prognostications concerning her future and finally driving her small fry before her closed the street door with a bang which induced mrs wheeler to speak of heredity and mr wheeler’s sister jane’s temper  where are you going poppy she enquired as the girl rose to follow the dutiful mr wheeler i want to speak to you a moment  the girl resumed her seat and taking up a small garment intended for the youngest wheeler but two or the youngest but one whichever it happened to fit best or whichever wanted it first stitched on in silence i want to speak to you about bob said mrs wheeler impressively of course you know he never keeps anything from his mother he ’as told me about all the gells he has walked out with and though of course he ’as been much run after he is threeandtwenty and not married yet he told me that none of ’em seemed to be worthy of him  she paused for so long that poppy tyrell looked up from her work said yes in an expressionless manner and waited for her to continue  he’s been a good son said the mother fondly never no trouble always been pertickler and always quite the gentleman he always smokes his cigar of a sunday and i remember the very first money ’e ever earned ’e spent on a cane with a dog’s ’ed to it  yes said poppy again  the gells he’s ’ad after ’im wouldn’t be believed said mrs wheeler shaking her head with a tender smile at a hole in the carpet before you came here there was a fresh one used to come in every sunday almost but ’e couldn’t make up his mind we used to joke him about it  he’s very young still said poppy  he’s old enough to be married said mrs wheeler he’s told me all about you he never has no secrets from ’is mother he told me that he asked you to walk out with ’im last night and you said ’no’ but i told ’im that that was only a gell’s way and that you’d give ’im another answer soon  that was my final answer said poppy tyrell the corners of her mouth hardening i shall never say anything else  all young gells say that at first said mrs wheeler making praiseworthy efforts to keep her temper wheeler ’ad to ask me five times  i meant what i said said poppy stitching industriously i shall never change my mind  it’s early days to ask you perhaps so soon after captain flower’s death suggested mrs wheeler  that has nothing at all to do with it said the girl i shall not marry your son in any case  not good enough for you i suppose said the other her eyes snapping in my time beggars couldn’t be choosers  they can’t choose much now said poppy in a low voice but as you know i’m going to a situation on monday i shall soon be able to pay off my debt to you though of course i can’t repay you for your kindness in letting me live here when i had nowhere else to go  it isn’t me you owe it to said mrs wheeler i’m sure i couldn’t ’ave afforded to do it whatever wheeler liked to say if bob hadn’t come forward and paid for you  bob cried poppy springing to her feet and dropping her work onto the floor  yes bob said the other melodramatically ’im what isn’t good enough to be your husband  i didn’t know said the girl brokenly you should have told me i would sooner starve i would sooner beg in the streets i will go at once  i daresay you know where to go so i sha’n’t worry about you replied mrs wheeler you quiet ones are generally the worst  i am sorry murmured poppy i did not mean to be rude or ungrateful  you’re very kind said mrs wheeler is mr fraser up in london  i’m sure i don’t know said the girl pausing at the door  sure to be though said mrs wheeler significantly you won’t ’ave to starve my dear but there you know that—some people’s pride is a funny thing  miss tyrell regarded her for a moment in silence and then quitted the room coming back again from halfway up the stairs to answer a knock at the door she opened it slowly and discovered to her horror mr fraser standing upon the doorstep with a smile which was meant to be propitiatory but only succeeded in being uneasy  is that mr fraser demanded mrs wheeler’s voice shrilly  that’s me said fraser heartily as he shook hands with poppy and entered the room  i thought you wouldn’t be far off said mrs wheeler in an unpleasant voice poppy’s been expecting you  i didn’t know that mr fraser was coming said poppy as the helpless man looked from one to the other i suppose he has come to see you he has not come to see me  yes i have said mr fraser calmly i wanted—  but miss tyrell had gone quietly upstairs leaving him to gaze in a perturbed fashion at the sickly and somewhat malicious face on the sofa  what’s the matter he enquired  nothing said mrs wheeler  isn’t miss tyrell well  so far as i’m permitted to know the state of ’er ’ealth she is was the reply  mr wheeler well enquired fraser after a long pause  very well i thank you said mrs wheeler  and miss wheeler and bob and the whole pa—— and all of them said fraser  all very well said mrs wheeler  his stock of conversation being exhausted he sat glancing uncomfortably round the littered room painfully conscious that mrs wheeler was regarding him with a glance that was at once hostile and impatient while he was wondering whether miss tyrell had gone upstairs for a permanency he heard her step on the stairs and directly afterwards she appeared at the door with her hat and jacket on  goodbye mrs wheeler she said gravely  goodbye said mrs wheeler in the same way that a freespeaking woman would have said goodriddance  the girl’s eyes rested for a moment on fraser then she bade him goodbye and opening the door passed into the street  fraser looked at mrs wheeler in perplexity then jumping up suddenly as poppy passed the window he crossed to the door  goodbye mrs wheeler he shouted and vaguely conscious that something was wrong somewhere dashed off in pursuit  poppy tyrell her face pale and her eyes burning quickened her pace as she heard hurrying footsteps behind her  i just wanted a few words with you miss tyrell said fraser somewhat breathlessly  i—i am going on business said poppy in a quiet voice  i didn’t understand mrs wheeler just now said fraser i hope you didn’t mind my calling  oh no said the girl call as often as you like but this evening i’m busy come tomorrow  this hospitality overreached itself have you left the wheelers he enquired suddenly  yes said poppy simply  what’s the good of telling me to call then enquired fraser bluntly  they will be pleased to see you i’m sure said miss tyrell  where are you going asked fraser  miss tyrell made no reply except to favour him with a glance which warned him not to repeat the question and he walked beside her for some time in silence  goodbye she said suddenly  i’m not going said fraser with artless surprise  mr fraser said the girl reddening with anger will you please understand that i wish to be alone  no said mr fraser doggedly  a gentleman would not have to have half as much said to him said poppy trembling  well thank god i’m not a gentleman said fraser calmly  if i had a father or a brother you would not behave like this said the girl  if you had a father or a brother they would do it instead said fraser gently it’s just because you’ve got nobody else that i’m looking after you  miss tyrell who had softened slightly stiffened again with temper  you she said hotly what right have you to trouble yourself about me  no right at all said fraser cheerfully but i’m going to do it if you’ve left the wheelers where are you going  miss tyrell gazing straight in front of her made no reply  won’t you tell me persisted the other  i’m not going anywhere said poppy stopping suddenly and facing him i’ve got a new berth next monday and tomorrow morning i am going to see them to ask them to employ me at once  and tonight suggested the other  i shall go for a walk said the girl now that you know all about my concerns will you please go  walk repeated fraser walk what all night you can’t do it—you don’t know what it’s like will you let me lend you some money you can repay me as soon as you like  no thank you  for my sake he suggested  miss tyrell raised her eyebrows  i’m a bad walker he explained  the reply trembling on miss tyrell’s lips realised that it was utterly inadequate to the occasion and remained unspoken she walked on in silence apparently oblivious of the man by her side and when he next spoke to her made no reply he glanced at a clock in a baker’s shop as they passed and saw that it was just seven  in this sociable fashion they walked along the commercial road and on to aldgate and then passing up fenchurch street mingled with the crowd thronging homewards over london bridge they went as far as kennington in this direction and then the girl turned and walked back to the city fraser glancing at the pale profile beside him ventured to speak again  will you come down to wapping and take my cabin for the night he asked anxiously the mate’s away and i can turn in fo’ard—you can have it all to yourself  miss tyrell still looking straight in front of her made no reply but with another attempt to shake off this pertinacious young man of the sea quickened her pace again fraser fell back  if i’m not fit to walk beside you i’ll walk behind he said in a low voice you won’t mind that  in this way they walked through the rapidly thinning streets it was now dark and most of the shops had closed the elasticity had departed from miss tyrell’s step and she walked aimlessly noting with a sinking at the heart the slowly passing time once or twice she halted from sheer weariness fraser halting too and watching her with a sympathy of which flower would most certainly have disapproved if he had seen it  at length in a quiet street beyond stratford she not only stopped but turned and walked slowly back frascr turned too and his heart beat as he fancied that she intended to overtake him he quickened his pace in time with the steps behind him until they slackened and faltered then he looked round and saw her standing in the centre of the pathway with her head bent he walked back slowly until he stood beside her and saw that she was crying softly he placed his hand on her arm  go away she said in a low voice  i shall not  you walked away from me just now  i was a brute said frascr vehemently  the arm beneath his hand trembled and he drew it unresistingly through his own in the faint light from the lamp opposite he saw her look at him  i’m very tired she said and leaned on him trustfully were you really going to leave me just now  you know i was not said fraser simply  miss tyrell walking very slowly pondered i should never have forgiven you if you had she said thoughtfully i’m so tired i can hardly stand you must take me to your ship  they walked slowly to the end of the road but the time seemed very short to fraser as far as he was concerned he would willingly have dispensed with the tram which they met at the end and the antique fourwheeler in which they completed their journey to the river they found a waterman’s skiff at the stairs and sat side by side in the stern looking contentedly over the dark water as the waterman pulled in the direction of the swallow which was moored in the tier there was no response to their hail and fraser himself clambering over the side with the painter assisted miss tyrell who as the daughter of one sailor and the guest of another managed to throw off her fatigue sufficiently to admire the lines of the small steamer  fraser conducted her to the cabin and motioning her to a seat on the locker went forward to see about some supper he struck a match in the forecastle and scrutinised the sleepers and coming to the conclusion that something which was lying doubled up in a bunk with its head buried in the pillow was the cook shook it vigourously  did you want the cook sir said a voice from another bunk  yes said fraser sharply as he punched the figure again and again  pore cookie ain’t well sir said the seaman sympathetically ’e’s been very delikit all this evenin’ that’s the worst o’ them teetotalers  all right that’ll do said the skipper sharply as he struck another match and gave the invalid a final disgusted punch where’s the boy  a small dirty face with matted hair protruded from the bunk above the cook and eyed him sleepily  get some supper said fraser quick  supper sir said the boy with a surprised yawn  and be quick about it said the skipper and wash you face first and put a comb through your hair come out you get  the small sleeper sighed disconsolately and first extending one slender leg clambered out and began to dress yawning pathetically as he did so  and some coffee said fraser as he lit the lamp and turned to depart  bill said the small boy indignantly  wot d’ye want said the seaman  ’elp me to wake that drunken pig up said the youth pointing a resentful finger at the cook i ain’t goin’ to do all the work  you leave ’im alone said bill ferociously the cook had been very liberal that evening and friendship is friendship after all  that’s what a chap gets by keeping hisself sober said the youthful philosopher as he poured a little cold tea out of the kettle on his handkerchief and washed himself other people’s work to do  he went grumbling up to the galley and lighting some sticks put the kettle on and then descended to the cabin starting with genuine surprise as he saw the skipper sitting opposite a pretty girl who was leaning back in her seat fast asleep  cook’ll be sorry ’e missed this he murmured as he lighted up and began briskly to set the table he ran up on deck again to see how his fire was progressing and thrusting his head down the forecastle communicated the exciting news to bill  to fraser sitting watching his sleeping guest it seemed like a beautiful dream that poppy tyrell should be sitting in his cabin and looking to him as her only friend seemed almost incredible a sudden remembrance of flower subdued at once the ardour of his gaze and he sat wondering vaguely as to the whereabouts of that erratic mariner until his meditations were broken by the entrance of the boy with the steaming coffee followed by bill bearing a couple of teaspoons  i nearly went to sleep said poppy as fraser roused her gently  she took off her hat and jacket and fraser taking them from her laid them reverently in his bunk then poppy moved farther along the seat and taking some coffee pronounced herself much refreshed  i’ve been very rude to you she said softly but mrs wheeler was very unkind and said that of course i should go to you that was why  mrs wheeler is— began fraser and stopped suddenly  of course it was quite true said poppy healthfully attacking her plate i did have to come to you  it was rather an odd way of coming said fraser my legs ache now  the girl laughed softly and continued to laugh then her eyes moistened and her face became troubled fraser as the best thing to do made an excuse and went up on deck to the discomfort of bill and the boy who were not expecting him  poppy was calm again by the time he returned and thanked him again softly as he showed her her bunk and withdrew for the night bill and the boy placed their berths at his disposal but he declined them in favour of a blanket in the galley where he sat up and slept but ill all night and was a source of great embarrassment to the cook next morning when he wanted to enter to prepare breakfast  poppy presided over that meal and it and the subsequent walk to discover lodgings are among fraser’s dearest memories he trod on air through the squalid roads by her side and the apartments having been obtained sat on the arm of the armchair—the most comfortable part—and listened to her plans  and you won’t go away without letting me know he said as he rose to depart  miss tyrell shook her head and her eyes smiled at him you know i won’t she said softly i don’t want to  she saw him to the door and until he had quitted the gate kept it hospitably open fraser with his head in a whirl went back to the swallow     chapter xviii     the prime result of mrs banks’ nocturnal ramble with mr william green was a feeling of great bitterness against her old friend captain john barber mr green despite her protests was still a member of the crew of the foam and walked about seabridge in broad daylight while she crept forth only after sundown and saw a hidden meaning in every fine evening mrs banks which met her she pointed out to captain barber that his refusal to dismiss mr green was a reflection upon her veracity and there was a strange light in her eyes and a strange hardening of her mouth as the old man said that to comply with her request would be to reflect upon the polite seaman’s veracity  her discomfiture was not lessened by the unbecoming behaviour of her daughter who in some subtle manner managed to convey that her acceptance of her mother’s version of the incident depended upon the way she treated mr frank gibson it was a hard matter to a woman of spirit and a harder thing still that those of her neighbours who listened to her account of the affair were firmly persuaded that she was setting her cap at captain barber  to clear her character from this imputation and at the same time to mark her sense of the captain’s treatment of her mrs banks effected a remarkable change of front and without giving him the slightest warning set herself to help along his marriage to mrs church  she bantered him upon the subject when she met him out and disregarding his wrathful embarrassment accused him in a loud voice of wearing his tie in a loveknot she also called him a turtledove the conversation ended here the turtledove going away crimson with indignation and cooing wickedly  humbled by the terrors of his position the proud shipowner turned more than ever to captain nibletts for comfort and sympathy and it is but due to that little man to say that anything he could have done for his benefactor would have given him the greatest delight he spent much of his spare time in devising means for his rescue all of which the old man listened to with impatience and rejected with contumely  it’s no good nibletts he said as they sat in the subdued light of the cabin one evening  nothing can be done if anything could be done i should have thought of it  yes that’s what struck me said the little skipper dutifully  i’ve won that woman’s ’art said captain barber miserably in ’er anxiety to keep me the woman’s natur’ has changed there’s nothing she wouldn’t do to make sure of me  it’s understandable said nibletts  it’s understandable agreed captain barber but it’s orkard instead o’ being a mild amiable sort o’ woman all smiles the fear o’ losing me has changed ’er into a determined jealous woman she told me herself it was love of me as ’ad changed her  you ain’t written to her i suppose asked nibletts twisting his features into an expression of great cunning  captain barber shook his head if you’d think afore speaking nibletts he said severely you’d know as people don’t write to each other when they’re in the same house  the skipper apologised what i mean to say is this he said softly she hasn’t got your promise in writing and she’s done all the talking about it i’m the only one you’ve spoken to about it i s’pose  captain barber nodded  well forget all about it said nibletts in an excited whisper  captain barber looked at him pityingly  what good’ll that do he asked  forget the understanding continued nibletts in a stage whisper forget everything forget captain flower’s death act as you acted just afore he went people’ll soon see as you’re strange in your manner and i’ll put the news about as you’ve been so affected by that affair that your memory’s gone  i was thinking of doing that the other day myself said captain barber slowly and untruthfully  i thought you was from something you said replied nibletts  i think i spoke of it or i was going to said barber  you did say something said nibletts  i wonder what would be the best way to begin said barber regarding him attentively  captain niblett’s nerve failed him at the responsibility  it’s your plan captain barber he said impressively and nobody can tell a man like you how it should be done it wants acting and you’ve got to have a good memory to remember that you haven’t got a memory  say that agin said captain barber breathing thickly  captain nibletts repeated it and captain barber after clearing his brain with a glass of spirits bade him a solemn goodnight and proceeded slowly to his home the door was opened by mrs church and a hum of voices from the front room indicated company captain barber hanging his hat on a peg entered the room to discover mrs banks and daughter attended by mr gibson  where’s fred he asked slowly as he took a seat  who said miss banks with a little scream  lawkamussy bless the man said her mother i never did  not come in yet asked barber looking round with a frightful stare the foam’s up  the company exchanged glances of consternation  why is he alive enquired mrs church sharply  alive repeated captain barber why shouldn’t he be he was alive yesterday wasn’t he  there was a dead silence and then captain barber from beneath his shaggy eyebrows observed with delight that gibson tapping his forehead significantly gave a warning glance at the others while all four sitting in a row watched anxiously for the first signs of acute mania  i expect he’s gone round after you my dear said the wily barber to miss banks  in the circumstances this was certainly cruel and gibson coughed confusedly  i’ll go and see said miss banks hurriedly come along mother  the two ladies followed by mr gibson shook hands and withdrew hurriedly captain barber wondering how to greet mrs church after he had let them out fixed his eyes on the carpet and remained silent  aren’t you well enquired the lady tenderly  well ma’am repeated uncle barber with severity  ma’am said mrs church in tones of tender reproach two hours ago i was laura have you been to the ’thorn’  what ’thorn’ demanded captain barber who had decided to forget as much as possible as the only safe way  the thorn inn said mrs church impatiently  where is it enquired captain barber ingenuously  mrs church looked at him with deep consideration why at the end of the cottages opposite the ’swan  what ’swan’ enquired captain barber  the swan inn said mrs church restraining her temper but with difficulty  where is it said uncle barber with breezy freshness  opposite the ’thorn’ at the end of the row said mrs church slowly  well what about it enquired captain barber  nothing said mrs church sharply and proceeded to set supper  captain barber hugging himself over his scheme watched her eagerly evincing a little bewilderment as she brought on a small unappetizing rind of cheese bread two glasses and a jug of water he checked himself just in time from asking for the cold fowl and bacon left from dinner and drawing his chair to the table eyed the contents closely  only bread and cheese he said somewhat peevishly  that’s all said mrs church smiling bread and cheese and kisses  captain barber tapped his forehead what did we have for dinner he asked suddenly  sausages replied mrs church blandly we ate them all  a piece of captain barber’s cheese went the wrong way and he poured himself out some water and drank it hurriedly where’s the beer he demanded  you’ve got the key of the cask said the housekeeper  captain barber whose temper was rising denied it  i gave it to you this morning said mrs church you were going to do something to it don’t you know  i don’t remember said uncle barber surlily  whatever has happened to your memory said mrs church sweetly  my memory said the trickster slowly passing his hand over his brow why what’s the matter with it  it doesn’t seem quite so good as it was said the lady affectionately never mind my memory will have to do for both  there was enough emphasis on this last sentence to send a little chill through the captain’s frame  he said nothing but keeping his eye on his plate attacked his frugal meal in silence and soon afterwards went upstairs to bed to think out his position  if his own memory was defective mrs church’s was certainly redundant when he came hurrying in to dinner next day she remembered that he had told her he should not be home to that meal he was ungallant enough to contemplate a raid upon hers she with a rare thoughtfulness had already eaten it he went to the thorn and had some cold salt beef and cursed the ingenious nibletts now on his way to london skyhigh  mrs banks came in the next evening with her daughter and condoled with the housekeeper on the affliction which had already been noised about seabridge mrs church who had accepted her as an ally but with mental reservations softly applied a handkerchief to her eyes  how are you feeling demanded mrs banks in the voice of one addressing a deaf invalid  i’m all right said barber shortly  that’s his pride said mrs church mournfully he won’t own to it he can’t remember anything he pretends he doesn’t know me  who are you asked the sufferer promptly  he’ll get the better of it said mrs banks kindly as her quondam foe wiped her eyes again if he don’t you’d better marry before october  to say that captain barber pricked up his ears at this indicates but feebly his interest in the remark he held his breath and looked wildly round the room as the two ladies deftly ignoring him made their arrangements for his future  i don’t like to seem to hurry it said the housekeeper  no of course you don’t if he said october naturally october it ought to be in the usual way remarked the other  i never said october interrupted the trembling mariner  there’s his memory again said mrs banks in a low voice  poor dear sighed the other  we’ll look after your interests said mrs banks with a benevolent smile don’t you remember meeting me by the church the other night and telling me that you were going to marry mrs church in october  no bawled the affrighted man  clean gone said mrs church shaking her head it’s no use  not a bit said mrs banks  october seems rather early said mrs church especially as he is in mourning for his nephew  there’s no reason for waiting said mrs banks decidedly i daresay it’s his loneliness that makes him want to hurry it after all he ought to know what he wants  i never said a word about it interposed captain barber in a loud voice  all right said mrs banks indulgently what are you going to wear my dear she added turning to the housekeeper  mrs church seemed undecided and captain barber wiping the moisture from his brow listened as one in a dream to a long discussion on the possibilities of her wardrobe thrice he interrupted and thrice the ladies suspending their conversation for a moment eyed him with tender pity before resuming it  me and frank thought of october said elizabeth speaking for the first time she looked at captain barber and then at her mother it was the look of one offering to sell a casting vote  october’s early said the old lady bridling  mrs church looked up at her and then modestly looked down again why not a double wedding she asked gently  captain barber’s voice was drowned in acclamations elizabeth kissed mrs church and then began to discuss her own wardrobe the owner of the house the owner of the very chairs on which they were sitting endeavoured in vain to stop them on a point of order and discovered to his mortification that a man without a memory is a man without influence in twenty minutes it was all settled and even an approximate date fixed there was a slight movement on the part of elizabeth to obtain captain barber’s opinion upon that but being reminded by her mother that he would forget all about it in half an hour’s time she settled it without him  i’m so sorry about your memory captain barber said mrs banks as she prepared to depart i can understand what a loss it is my memory’s a very good one i never forget anything  you forget yourself ma’am returned her victim with unconscious ambiguity and closing the door behind her returned to the parlour to try and think of some means of escaping from the position to which the ingenuity of captain nibletts aided by that of mrs banks had brought him     chapter xix     opponents of medicine have hit upon a means of cleansing the system by abstaining for a time from food and drinking a quantity of fair water it is stated to clear the eyes and the skin and to cause a feeling of lightness and buoyancy undreamt of by those who have never tried it all people perhaps are not affected exactly alike and captain flower while admitting the lightness would have disdainfully contested any charge of buoyancy against this objection it may be said that he was not a model patient and had on several occasions wilfully taken steps to remove the feeling of lightness  it was over a fortnight since his return to london the few shillings obtained for his watch had disappeared days before rent was due and the cupboard was empty the time seemed so long to him that poppy and seabridge and the foam might have belonged to another period of existence at the risk of detection he had hung round the wheelers night after night for a glimpse of the girl for whom he was enduring all these hardships but without success he became a prey to nervousness and unable to endure the suspense any longer determined to pay a stealthy visit to wapping and try and see fraser  he chose the night on which in the ordinary state of affairs the schooner should be lying alongside the wharf and keeping a keen lookout for friends and foes both made his way to the minories and down tower hill he had pictured it as teeming with people he knew and the bare street and closed warehouses with a chance docker or two slouching slowly along struck him with an odd sense of disappointment the place seemed changed he hurried past the wharf that too was deserted and after a loving peep at the spars of his schooner he drifted slowly across the road to the albion and pushing the door a little way open peeped cautiously in the faces were all unfamiliar and letting the door swing quietly back he walked on until he came to the town of yarmouth  the public bar was full tired workers were trying to forget the labours of the day in big draughts of beer while one of them had thrown off his fatigue sufficiently to show a friend a fancy step of which he was somewhat vain it was a difficult and intricate step for a crowded bar and panicstricken men holding their beer aloft called wildly upon him to stop while the barman leaning over the counter strove to make his voice heard above the din the dancer’s feet subsided into a sulky shuffle and a tall seaman removing the tankard which had obscured his face revealed the honest features of joe the sight of him and the row of glasses and hunches of bread and cheese behind the bar was irresistible the skipper caught a departing customer by the coat and held him  do me a favour old man he said heartily  wot d’ye want asked the other suspiciously  tell that tall chap in there that a friend of his is waiting outside said flower pointing to joe  he walked off a little way as the man reentered the bar a second or two later the carman came out alone  ’e ses come inside ’e ses if you want to see ’im  i can’t said flower  why not asked the other as a horrible suspicion dawned upon him strewth you ain’t a teetotaler are you  no replied the skipper but i can’t go in  well ’e won’t come out said the other ’e seems to be a shorttempered sort o’ man  i must see him said the skipper pondering then a happy thought struck him and he smiled at his cleverness tell him a little flower wants to see him he said briskly  a little wot demanded the carman blankly  a little flower repeated the other  where is she enquired the carman casting his eyes about him  you just say that said the skipper hurriedly you shall have a pint if you do he’ll understand  it was unfortunate for the other that the skipper had set too high an estimation on joe’s intelligence for the information being imparted to him in the audible tones of confidence he first gave his mug to mr william green to hold and then knocked the ambassador down the loud laugh consequent on the delivery of the message ceased abruptly and in the midst of a terrific hubbub joe and his victim together with two or three innocent persons loudly complaining that they hadn’t finished their beer were swept into the street  he’ll be all right in a minute mate said a bystander to joe anxiously don’t run away  ’tain’t so likely said joe scornfully  wot did you ’it me for demanded the victim turning a deaf ear to two or three strangers who were cuddling him affectionately and pointing out in alluring whispers numberless weak points in joe’s fleshly armour  i’ll ’it you agin if you come into a pub making a fool of me afore people replied the sensitive seaman blushing hotly with the recollection of the message  he told me to said the carman pointing to flower who was lurking in the background  the tall seaman turned fiercely and strode up to him and then to the scandal of the bystanders and the dismay of mr william green gave a loud yell and fled full speed up the road flower followed in hot pursuit and owing perhaps to the feeling of lightness before mentioned ran him down nearly a mile farther on mr green coming in a good second  keep orf panted the seaman backing into a doorway keep—it—orf  don’t be a fool joe said the skipper  keep orf repeated the trembling seaman  his fear was so great that mr green who had regarded him as a tower of strength and courage and had wormed himself into the tall seaman’s good graces by his open admiration of these qualities stood appalled at his idol’s sudden lack of spirit  don’t be a fool joe said the skipper sharply can’t you see it’s me  i thought you was drownded said the trembling seaman still regarding him suspiciously i thought you was a ghost  feel that said flower and gave him a blow in the ribs which almost made him regret that his first impression was not the correct one  i’m satisfied sir he said hastily  i was picked up and carried off to riga but for certain reasons i needn’t go into i want my being alive kept a dead secret you mustn’t breathe a word to anybody d’ye understand not a word  aye aye sir said joe you hear that willyum  who the devil’s this demanded the skipper who had not bargained for another confidant  it’s the new ’and sir said joe i’ll be answerable for ’im  flower eyed the pair restlessly but mr green assured him with a courtly bow that mr smith’s assurances might be relied upon he hoped he was a gentleman he said feelingly  some of us thought—i thought said joe with a glance at the skipper that the mate shoved you overboard  you always were a fool commented the skipper  yes sir said joe dutifully and as they moved slowly back along the road gave him the latest information about seabridge and the foam  the swallow’s just come up in the tier he concluded and if you want to see mr fraser i’ll go and see if he’s aboard  the skipper agreed and after exacting renewed assurances of secrecy from both men waited impatiently in the private bar of the waterman’s arms while they put off from the stairs and boarded the steamer  in twenty minutes during which time the penniless skipper affected not to notice the restless glances of the landlord they returned with fraser and a hearty meeting took place between the two men the famished skipper was provided with meat and drink while the two a b’s whetted their thirst in the adjourning bar  you’ve had a rough time said fraser as the skipper concluded a dramatic recital of his adventures  flower smiled broadly i’ve come out of it right side uppermost he said taking a hearty pull at his tankard the worst part was losing my money still it’s all in the day’s work joe tells me that elizabeth is walking out with gibson so you see it has all happened as i bargained for  i’ve heard so said fraser  it’s rather soon after my death said flower thoughtfully she’s been driven into it by her mother i expect how is poppy  fraser told him  i couldn’t wish her in better hands jack said the other heartily when he had finished one of these days when she knows everything—at least as much as i shall tell her—she’ll be as grateful to you as what i am  you’ve come back just in time said fraser slowly another week and you’d have lost her  lost her repeated flower staring  she’s going to new zealand replied the other she’s got some relations there she met an old friend of her father’s the other day captain martin master of the golden cloud and he has offered her a passage they sail on saturday from the albert dock  flower pushed the tankard from him and regarded him in consternation  she mustn’t go he said decisively  fraser shrugged his shoulders i tried to persuade her not to but it was no use she said there was nothing to stay in england for she’s quite alone and there is nobody to miss her  poor girl said flower softly and sat crumbling his bread and gazing reflectively at a sodawater advertisement on the wall he sat so long in this attitude that his companion also turned and studied it  she mustn’t go said flower at length i’ll go down and see her tomorrow night you go first and break the news to her and i’ll follow on do it gently jack it’s quite safe there’s nobody she can talk to now she’s left the wheelers and i’m simply longing to see her you don’t know what it is to be in love jack  what am i to tell her enquired the other hastily  tell her i was saved was the reply i’ll do the rest by jove i’ve got it  he banged the table so hard that his plate jumped and the glasses in the bar rattled in protest  anything wrong with the grub enquired the landlord severely  flower who was all excitement shook his head  because if there is continued the landlord i’d sooner you spoke of it than smash the table never mind about hurting my feelings  he wiped down the counter to show that flower’s heated glances had no effect upon him withdrawing reluctantly to serve an impatient customer  i’ll go down tomorrow morning to the golden cloud and try and ship before the mast said flower excitably get married out in new zealand and then come home when things are settled what do you think of that my boy how does that strike you  how will it strike cap’n barber asked fraser as soon as he had recovered sufficiently to speak  flower’s eyes twinkled it’s quite easy to get wrecked and picked up once or twice he said cheerfully i’ll have my story pat by the time i get home even to the names of the craft i was cast away in and i can say i heard of elizabeth’s marriage from somebody i met in new zealand i’ll manage all right  the master of the swallow gazed at him in helpless fascination  they want hands on the golden cloud he said slowly but what about your discharges  i can get those said flower complacently a man with money and brains can do anything lend me a pound or two before i forget it will you and if you’ll give me poppy’s address i’ll be outside the house at seven tomorrow lord fancy being on the same ship with her for three months  he threw down a borrowed sovereign on the counter and ordering some more drinks placed them on the table fraser had raised his to his lips when he set it down again and with a warning finger called the other’s attention to the remarkable behaviour of the door communicating with the next bar which in open defiance of the fact that it possessed a patent catch of the latest pattern stood open at least three or four inches  draught questioned flower staring at the phenomenon  the other shook his head i’d forgotten those two chaps he said in a low voice they’ve been listening  flower shifted in his seat i’d trust joe anywhere he said uneasily but i don’t know about the other chap if he starts talking at seabridge i’m done i thought joe was alone when i sent in for him  fraser tapped his chin with his fingers i’ll try and get ’em to ship with me i want a couple of hands he said slowly i’ll have them under my eye then and besides they’re better at bittlesea than seabridge in any case  he rose noisily and followed by flower entered the next bar twenty minutes afterwards flower bade them all a hearty goodnight and mr green walking back to the schooner with joe dwelt complacently on the advantages of possessing a style and address which had enabled them to exchange the rudeness of ben for the appreciative amiability of captain fraser  flower was punctual to the minute next evening and shaking hands hastily with fraser who had gone down to the door to wait for him went in alone to see miss tyrell fraser smoking his pipe on the doorstep gave him a quarter of an hour and then went upstairs miss tyrell making a futile attempt to escape from the captain’s encircling arm as he entered the room flower had just commenced the recital of his adventures he broke off as the other entered but being urged by miss tyrell to continue glanced somewhat sheepishly at his friend before complying  when i rose to the surface he said slowly and saw the ship drawing away in the darkness and heard the cries on board i swam as strongly as i could towards it i was weighed down by my clothes and i had also struck my head going overboard and i felt that every moment was my last when i suddenly bumped up against the lifebelt i had just strength to put that on and give one faint hail and then i think for a time i lost my senses  miss tyrell gave an exclamation of pity mr fraser made a noise which might have been intended for the same thing  the rest of it was like a dream continued flower pressing the girl’s hand sometimes my eyes were open and sometimes not i heard the men pulling about and hailing me without being able to reply byandby that ceased the sky got grey and the water brown all feeling had gone out of me the sun rose and burnt in the salt on my face then as i rose and fell like a cork on the waters your face seemed to come before me and i determined to live  beautiful said fraser involuntarily  i determined to live repeated flower glancing at him defiantly i brushed the wet hair from my eyes and strove to move my chilled limbs then i shouted and anything more dreary than that shout across the waste of water i cannot imagine but it did me good to hear my own voice and i shouted again  he paused for breath and fraser taking advantage of the pause got up hurriedly and left the room muttering something about matches  he doesn’t like to hear of your sufferings said poppy  i suppose not said flower whose eloquence had received a chill but there is little more to tell i was picked up by a russian brig bound for riga and lay there some time in a state of fever when i got better i worked my passage home in a timber boat and landed yesterday  what a terrible experience said poppy as fraser entered the room again  shocking said the latter  and now you’ve got your own ship again said the girl weren’t your crew delighted to see you  i’ve not seen them yet said flower hesitatingly i shipped on another craft this morning before the mast  before the mast repeated the girl in amazement  fullrigged ship golden cloud bound for new zealand said flower slowly watching the effect of his words—we’re to be shipmates  poppy tyrell started up with a faint cry but flower drew her gently down again  we’ll be married in new zealand he said softly and then we’ll come back and i’ll have my own again jack told me you were going out on her another man has got my craft he lost the one he had before and i want to give him a chance for a few months poor chap to redeem his character besides it’ll be a change we shall see the world it’ll just be a splendid honeymoon  you didn’t tell captain martin enquired the girl as she drew back in her chair and eyed him perplexedly  not likely said flower with a laugh i’ve shipped in the name of robert orth i bought the man’s discharges this morning he’s lying in bed poor chap waiting for his last now and hoping it’ll be marked ’v g’  poppy was silent for a moment her eyes dark and inscrutable met fraser’s then she looked away and in a low voice addressed flower  i suppose you know best what is to be done she said quietly  you leave it to me said flower in satisfied tones i’m at the wheel  there was a long silence poppy got up and crossed to the window and resting her cheek on her hand sat watching the restless life of the street the room darkened slowly with the approach of evening flower rose and took the seat opposite and fraser who had been feeling in the way for some time said that he must go  you sail tomorrow evening jack said flower with a careless halfturn towards him  about six was the reply  we sail saturday evening at seven said flower and took the girl’s hand in his own it will be odd to see you on board poppy and not to be able to speak to you but we shall be able to look at each other sha’n’t we  captain martin is a strict disciplinarian said poppy  well he can’t prevent us looking at each other said flower and he can’t prevent us marrying when we get to the other end goodnight jack next time you see us we’ll be an old married couple  a quick passage and a safe return said fraser goodnight  poppy tyrell just gave him her small hand and that was all flower giving him a hearty grip accompanied him as far as the door of the room  he looked back as he gained the pavement and the last he saw of them they were sitting at the open window flower leaned out and waved his hand in farewell but poppy made no sign     chapter xx     in the rising seaport of bittlesea captain fraser walking slowly along the quay on the fateful saturday heard the hour of seven strike from the tower of the old church wedged in between the narrow streets at the back of the town the little harbour with its motley collection of craft vanished he heard the sharp hoarse cries of command on the golden cloud and saw the bridge slowly opening to give egress to the tug which had her in tow he saw her shapely hull and tapering spars glide slowly down the river while poppy tyrell leaning against the side took her last look at london he came back with a sigh to reality the swallow had dwindled to microscopical proportions and looked dirty bittlesea itself had the appearance of a village with foolish aspirations to be considered a port and he noticed with a strong sense of pity tempered with disdain the attentions of two young townsmen to a couple of gawky girls in white frocks  with a feeling that the confinement of the house would be insupportable he roamed idly about until the day gave place to twilight and the red eye of the lightship on the horizon peeped suddenly across the water bittlesea was dull to aching point a shirtsleeved householder or two sat in his fragrant frontgarden smoking and a murmur of voices and shag tobacco floated out from tavern doorways he paced up and down the quay until the necessity of putting a stop to the vagaries of his crew furnished him with a little wholesome diversion  in their quest for good beer mr green and joe had left themselves in the hands of the other members of the crew and had gone off with them in a body to the cap and bells where in a most pointed fashion mr green who had been regarding the fireman’s complexion for some time with much displeasure told the boy to go back to the ship and get his face washed  he’s all right ain’t you tommy said the cook coming to the rescue  boys ought to keep their faces clean said mr green impressively there’s nothing more unpleasant than a face what wants washing you don’t want to grow up like that do you look at it joe  it might be cleaner said joe thus appealed to slowly likewise it might be dirtier  it might be much dirtier said mr green emphatically anybody with eyes in their ’ed can see that  there was an awkward pause during which the fireman with one eye peeping furtively from beyond the rim of a quart pot saw both joe and the cook kick mr green’s foot to call his attention to the fact that his words might be misconstrued by another member of the party  i ’ate toffs he said deliberately as he placed his mug on the counter  they’re all right when you know ’em charlie said joe who was averse to having the evening spoiled at that early hour  a real toff’s bad enough continued the fireman but a himitation one—pah he buried his face in the pewter again and laughed discordantly  you go aboard and wash you face tommy repeated mr green i should think you’d find plenty o’ soap in charlie’s bunk  do you know what you want demanded the fireman regarding him fixedly  i know what you want said mr green with a supercilious smile  oh wot said the other  the polite seaman rose to his feet and watched him carefully a banjo he replied  it was not the reply according to timehonoured formula and charlie who was expecting something quite different was at no pains to hide his perplexity a banjo he repeated slowly a banjo—a ban——  light came to him suddenly and he flew at mr green with his fists whirling in a second the bar was in an uproar and the wellmeant and selfpreservative efforts of joe and the cook to get the combatants into the street were frustrated by people outside blocking up the doors they came out at last and fraser who was passing ran over just in time to save mr green who was doing his best from the consequences of a somewhat exaggerated fastidiousness the incident however afforded a welcome distraction and having seen mr green off in the direction of the steamer while the fireman returned to the publichouse he bent his steps homewards and played a filial game at cards with his father before retiring  they sailed for london the following afternoon mr green taking a jaundiced view of the world from a couple of black eyes while the fireman openly avowed that only the economical limitations of nature prevented him from giving him more fraser a prey to gentle melancholy called them to order once or twice and then left them to the mate a man whose talent for ready invective was at once the admiration and envy of his peers  the first night in london he spent on board and with pencil and paper sat down to work out the position of the golden cloud he pictured her with snowy pinions outspread passing down channel he pictured poppy sitting on the poop in a deckchair and flower coming as near as his work would allow exchanging glances with her then he went up on deck and lighting his pipe thought of that nevertobeforgotten night when poppy had first boarded the foam  the next night his mood changed and unable to endure the confinement of the ship he went for a lonely tramp round the streets he hung round the wheelers and after gazing at their young barbarians at play walked round and looked at flower’s late lodgings it was a dingy house with broken railings and an assortment of papers and bottles in the front garden and by no means calculated to relieve depression from there he instinctively wandered round to the lodgings recently inhabited by miss tyrell  he passed the house twice and noted with gloom the already neglected appearance of her front window the venetian blind half drawn up was five or six inches higher one side than the other and a vase of faded flowers added to the forlornness of the picture in his present state of mind the faded blooms seemed particularly appropriate and suddenly determining to possess them he walked up the steps and knocked at the door trembling like a young housebreaker over his first job  i think i left my pipe here the other night he stammered to the small girl who opened it  i’ll swear you didn’t said the small damsel readily  can i go up and see enquired fraser handing her some coppers  the small girl relented and even offered to assist him in his search but he waved her away and going upstairs sat down and looked drearily round the shabby little room an execrable ornament of green and pink paper in the fireplace had fallen down together with a little soot there was dust on the table and other signs of neglect he crossed over to the window and secured two or three of the blooms and was drying the stalks on his handkerchief when his eye suddenly lighted on a little white ball on the mantelpiece and hardly able to believe in his good fortune he secured a muchdarned pair of cotton gloves which had apparently been forgotten in the hurry of departure he unrolled them and pulling out the little shrivelled fingers regarded them with mournful tenderness then he smoothed them out and folding them with reverent fingers placed them carefully in his breastpocket he then became conscious that somebody was regarding his antics with amazement from the doorway  mr fraser said a surprised voice which tried to be severe  mr fraser bounded from his chair and stood regarding the intruder with a countenance in which every feature was outvying the other in amazement  i thought—you—were on the golden cloud he stammered  miss tyrell shook her head and looked down i missed the ship she said pensively  missed the ship shouted the other missed the ship did flower miss it too  i’m afraid not said miss tyrell even more pensively than before  good heavens i never heard of such a thing said fraser how ever did you manage to do it  i went to lie down a little while on saturday afternoon said poppy reflectively i’d got my box packed and everything ready when i got up it was past seven o’clock and then i knew it was no use ships won’t wait you know  fraser gazed at her in amaze in his mind’s eye he still saw the deck of the golden cloud but poppy’s deckchair was empty and flower in place of exchanging glances with her was walking about in a state equally compounded of wrath and bewilderment  and you had given up your berth in the city said fraser at length in concern  the consciousness of a little colour in her cheek which she could not repress affected miss tyrell’s temper no she said sharply  didn’t you intend to go then asked the bewildered fraser  i—oh will you give me my gloves please before i forget them said miss tyrell coldly  it was fraser’s turn to colour and he burnt a rich crimson as he fished them out  i was going to take care of them for you he said awkwardly i came to look after a pipe i thought i’d left here  i saw you taking care of them was the reply  there was a pause during which miss tyrell took a seat and folding her hands in her lap gazed at him with the calm gaze which comes of perfect misdoing and the feminine determination not to own up to it the room was no longer shabby and fraser was conscious of a strange exaltation  i understood that you had given notice in the city he said slowly but i’m very glad that you didn’t  miss tyrell shook her head and stooping down adjusted the firestove ornament  didn’t you intend to go repeated the tactful seaman  i’d left it open said miss tyrell thoughtfully i hadn’t definitely accepted captain martin’s invitation you jump at conclusions so but of course when i found that captain flower had shipped before the mast for my sake why i had to go  so you had said fraser staring  there was no help for it continued miss tyrell  didn’t seem like it said the more accurate fraser  his head was in a whirl and he tried vainly to think of the exact terms in which she had announced her intention to emigrate and combated the objections which he thought himself justified in advancing he began to remember in a misty uncertain fashion that they were somewhat vague and disjointed and for one brief moment he wondered whether she had ever had any idea of going at all one glance at the small figure of probity opposite was enough and he repelled the idea as unworthy  i believe that you are sorry i didn’t go said poppy suddenly  i’m sorry for flower said the other  he will be back in six or seven months said poppy gently that will soon pass away i shall not be very old to marry even then perhaps it is all for the best—i don’t like—  don’t like prompted fraser  don’t like to be hurried continued miss tyrell looking down  there was another pause the girl got up and walking to the window gazed out upon the street  there is a nice air in the streets now she said at length without turning round  fraser started politeness and inclination fought with conscience the allies won but inclination got none of the credit  would you care to go for a walk he asked  miss tyrell turned and regarded him with an unmistakable air of surprise  no thank you she said in a manner which indicated reproof  fraser shifted restlessly i thought that was what you meant he said indignantly  you jump at conclusions as i said before remarked miss tyrell it wouldn’t be right  i don’t see any harm in it said fraser stoutly we’ve been before and flower knows of it  the girl shook her head no she said firmly  to her surprise that ended the matter the rattle of traffic and the hum of voices came in at the open window the room seemed unwontedly quiet by contrast miss tyrell sat reaping the empty reward of virtue and bestowing occasional glances on the fine specimen of marine obtuseness in the armchair  i hope that i am not keeping you from a walk she observed at length  no said fraser  he rose in confusion wondering whether this was a hint for him to go and after a supreme mental effort decided that it was and murmured something about getting back to the ship poppy shook hands with him patiently it is always a sad thing to see a fine young man lacking in intelligence some of her pity perhaps showed in her eyes  are you going she asked with a shade of surprise in her voice  fraser gazed at her in perplexity i suppose so he murmured  which means that you want a walk but don’t like leaving me here alone i suppose said miss tyrell resignedly very well i will come  she left him for a moment in search of her hat and then putting aside the gloves she was about to don in favour of those he had endeavoured to secrete led the way downstairs her composure was sufficient for two which was just the quantity required at that moment     chapter xxi     the summer passed quickly all too quickly for captain barber who said that it was the shortest he ever remembered but then his memory although greatly improved was still none of the best many things which mrs church fondly and frequently referred to having escaped it altogether  he even forgot that he was to be married in october and in these circumstances mrs gibson miss banks and mrs church put their banns up this acted as a specific and captain barber putting the best face he could on the matter went and interviewed the verger on his own behalf  the weddingday found him resigned but dazed the morning air was crisp and chill with a faint odour of dead leaves and the aromatic smell of chrysanthemums which decked the front garden the house was as clean as a new pin or the deck of the foam which having been thoroughly scrubbed down in honour of the occasion was now slowly drying in the sun down below the crew having finished their labours for the day were anxiously attiring themselves in their sunday best  the grizzled head of ben popped out at the companion and sniffed heartily at the smell of wet deck his coat was of black and his new boots creaked deliciously as he slowly paced the deck and affected ignorance of the little cluster of heads at the forecastle hatch he went below again and a murmur gentle but threatening rose against tim  you wait said the youth sharply  if you’ve made me waste eighteenpence timmy said a stout a b named jones the lord ha’ mercy on you ’cos i won’t  the cook who was clinging to the ladder with his head level with the deck gave an excited gasp tim’s all right he said look there  the last words were jerked out of him by reason of the weight of his friends who were now leaning on him breathing heavily under the stress of strong excitement ben was on deck again and in an obviously unconcerned manner was displaying a silk hat of great height to all who cared to look the mate’s appearance alone without the flags which dressed the schooner would have indicated a festival  three or four labourers sunning themselves on the quay were much impressed and regarded him stolidy a fisherman presuming upon the fact that they both earned their living on the water ventured to address him  now then said jones as he took something reverently from an empty bunk who’s going up fust  i ain’t said tim  wot about you cookie said jones  well wot about me demanded the other  i thought p’r’aps you’d like to lead the way said mr jones mildly  you thought wrong then said the cook shortly  it was jist a compliment urged mr jones  i don’t like flattery said the cook never did  mr jones sighed and shook his head irresolutely the other ab patted him on the back  you look a fair bloomin’ treat he said heartily you go up fust you look as though you’ve slep’ in one a’most  none o’ your larks you know remarked mr jones with suspicious sourness no backing out of it and leavin’ me there by myself  there was a chorus of virtuous but profane indignation it was so indignant that mr jones apologised and stood for some time regarding the article in his hand with the face of a small child eyeing a large powder then he clapped it on his head and went on deck  the mate was just talking to the fisherman about an uncle of his born since his promotion who had commanded a brig when his voice failed him and he gazed openmouthed at a stout seaman who had just come up on deck on the stout seaman’s face was the look of one who sees a vision many miles off on the stout seaman’s head was a high hat of antique pattern which had suffered in the brushing to avoid the mate’s eye he folded his arms and leaning over the side gazed across the river words trembled on the mate’s lips but they died away in a squeak as a little tophatted procession of three issued coyly from the forecastle and ranging itself beside mr jones helped him to look across the river  i never did said the fisherman what are we acoming to  the mate did not stay to inform him he walked hastily to the quartette and bursting with rage asked jones what he meant by it  mean by wot sir asked jones in surprise  tophats said the mate choking  the four turned and regarded him stolidly keeping as close together as possible for the sake of moral support and the safety of their headgear  for the weddin’ sir said jones as though that explained everything  you take ’em off said the mate sharply i won’t let you wear ’em  i beg your pardin said jones with great politeness we got these ’ere ’ats for the weddin’ an’ we’re agoin’ to wear ’em  he took the offending article off and brushed it tenderly with his coatsleeve while the furious mate looked assault and battery at the other three tim whose hat came well down over his eyes felt comparatively safe but the cook conscious that his perched lightly on the top of his head drew back a pace then he uttered an exclamation as captain nibletts who was officiating as best man came hurriedly down the cliff  hats said the little skipper disengaging himself from the mate’s grasp as he came on board yes i don’t mind  wot about capt’in barber demanded the mate impressively  if they was puddingbasins ’e wouldn’t mind said nibletts testily he’s that nervous ’e don’t know what ’e’s doing hardly he was raving like a madman for five minutes cos ’e couldn’t fasten his collar and then i found he’d forgot to put his shirt on he don’t care  he hurried down to the cabin and then came bustling up again his small face was strained with worry and the crew eyed him respectfully as he came forward and dealt out white satin favours  cap’in barber’ll be all right with you looking arter ’im sir said jones with strong conviction  that he will said the cook nodding  there’s some whisky in a bottle in my locker cook said nibletts dancing about nervously give the hands one drink each cook only one mind  the men thanked him and with kindly eyes watched him go ashore the cook went down for the whisky and tim diving into the forecastle brought up four mugs  he must ha’ meant another bottle said jones as the cook came slowly up again with a bottle containing one dose  there ain’t another said the cook he’s ’alf off ’is ’ed  there was a pained silence we must toss for it said jones at length that is unless you chaps don’t want it  toss said three voices speaking as one  jones sighed and the coins were produced the prize fell to tim and he leaned against the windlass and slowly poured the yellow liquid into his mug  there’s more than i thought there was remarked mr jones in surprise  bottles is deceiving said the cook  it ain’t the fust toss as tim ’as won said the third man darkly  the ordinary seaman made no reply but stepping over to the watercask added with great care a little water  here’s your ’ealth chaps he said goodnaturedly as he drank and may you never want a drink  you’ve never drunk all that tim said mr jones anxiously  tim shook his head there’s too much to drink all at once he said gravely and sat with the mug on his knee gazing ashore it’s warming me all over he mused i never tasted sich whisky afore i’m in a gentle glow  so was the cook a glow which increased to fever heat as the youth raised the mug to his lips again and slowly drained it and handed it to him to wash up  a little later the men went ashore and strolling aimlessly up and down the road passed the time in waiting for the ceremony and making sudden dashes after small boys who were throwing at their hats and hitting their heads  seabridge itself was quiet but mrs banks’ house was in a state of ferment ladies with pins in their mouths wandered about restlessly until coming into the orbit of one of the brides they stuck one or two into her and then drew back to behold the effect miss banks in white satin moved about stiffly mrs church in heliotrope glanced restlessly up the road every time she got near the window  now you sit down said one lady at length both of you all you’ve got to do now is to wait for the gentlemen  it was whispered that mr gibson’s delay was due to the fact that he had gone up for captain barber and as time passed a certain restlessness became apparent in the assembly and sympathetic glances were thrown in the direction of mrs church places at the window were at a premium and several guests went as far as the garden gate and looked up the road still no captain barber  it’s time they were here said mrs banks at last in a stern voice  there was a flutter at the gate and a pretty girl heliographed with her eyes that the parties of the other part were in sight a minute or two later they came into sight of the window captain barber clad in beautiful raiment headed the cortège the rear of which was brought up by the crew of the foam and a cloud of light skirmishers which hovered on their flanks as they drew near it was noticed that captain barber’s face was very pale and his hands trembled but he entered the house with a firm step and required no assistance  of his reception there was never for a moment any doubt young matrons smiled and shook their heads at him middleaged matrons took him by the hand while old ladies committed themselves to the statement that they had seen matrimony in his eye for years he received the full measure accorded to a very distinguished convert and taking a chair placed against the wall surveyed the company with the air of a small boy who has strayed into a hostile alley a little natural curiosity found vent  now what first put it into your head to get married ask one fair enquirer  mrs church said the exmariner simply  yes of course said the matron but was it love at first sight or did it grow on you before you knew it  captain barber blushed it growed on me afore i knew it he replied fervently  i suppose said a lady of a romantic turn of mind that you didn’t know what was happening at first  i did not ma’am agreed the captain in trembling tones nobody was more surprised than wot i was  how strange said two or three voices  they regarded him tenderly and the youngest bridesmaid a terrible child of ten climbed up on his knee and made audible comparisons between the two bridegrooms which made mr gibson smile  time we started said mrs banks raising her voice above the din cap’in barber you and mr gibson and the other gentlemen had better get to the church  the men got up obediently and in solemn silence formed up in the little passage and then started for the church some two hundred yards distant the crew of the foam falling in behind unchallenged  to this day captain barber does not know how he got there and he resolutely declines to accept captain niblett’s version as the mere offspring of a disordered imagination he also denies the truth of a statement circulated in the town that night that instead of replying to a leading question in the manner plainly laid down in the church service he answered i suppose so  he came out of the church with a buzzing in his ears and a mist before his eyes something was clinging to his arm which he tried several times to shake off then he discovered that it was mrs barber  of the doings of the crew of the foam that night it were better not to speak suffice it to say that when they at length boarded their ship tim was the only one who still possessed a hat and in a fit of pride at the circumstance coupled perhaps with other reasons went to bed in it he slept but ill however and at 4 a m the tide being then just on the ebb the only silk hat in the forecastle went bobbing up and down on its way to the sea     chapter xxii     a fine october gave way to a damp and dreary november a month of mists and fogs in which shipping of all sizes and all nations played blind man’s buff at sea and felt their way mere voices crying in the wilderness up and down the river the swallow with a soul too large for its body cannoned a firstclass battleship off the medway and with a thoughtfulness too often lacking at sea stood by and lowered a boat whereupon the captain who had been worrying about his paint invented in his surprise a brandnew adjective for the use of senior officers of the british navy  over three months had elapsed since the golden cloud set out on her long voyage three months during which fraser despite his better sense had been a constant visitor of poppy tyrell’s and had assisted her in the search for fresh lodgings to avoid the attentions of mr bob wheeler who having discovered her whereabouts had chosen to renew his suit  on two or three occasions the girl had accompanied him on board the steamer and at such times it was mr green’s pleasure to wink in a frenzied manner at mr joe smith and to make divers bets of pints of beer which made that thirsty soul half crazy to listen to he also said that any one with half an eye could see what was in the wind  and a very nice couple they’ll make too said joe solemnly  an’ what about cap’in flower suggested mr green she’s evident the young lady he was talking about that night and tommy’s heard ’em speaking about him once or twice too  joe shuffled uneasily he was beginning to entertain a considerable regard for his new skipper dating from the time he discovered that his sinister suspicions concerning him were unfounded he had moreover conceived a doglike admiration for poppy tyrell  that’s ’is business he said shortly judging by what you ’eard in that pub cap’in flower knows where to put ’is hand on one or two more if ’e wants ’em  he walked off in dudgeon ignoring a question by mr green as to whose foot kep’ the door open and felt dimly the force of the diction that no man can serve two masters and with a view to saving himself worry dismissed the matter from his mind until some weeks afterwards it was forcibly revived by the perusal of a newspaper which the engineer had brought on board without giving himself time for due reflection he ran up on deck and approached the skipper  golden cloud’s in the paper as overdue sir he said respectfully  what is enquired fraser sharply  golden cloud sir boat cap’in flower is on said joe slowly  fraser regarded him sternly what do you know about it he asked  joe looked round helplessly at such moments willyum green was a tower of strength but at the present time he was fooling about helping the ship’s cat to wash itself  what do you know about it repeated fraser  willyum told me sir said joe hastily  mr green being summoned hastily put down the cat and came aft while joe with a full confidence in his friend’s powers edged a few feet away and listened expectantly as the skipper interrogated him  yes sir i did tell joe sir he answered with a reproachful glance at that amateur i met cap’in flower that evening again late an’ he told me himself i’m sorry to see by this morning’s paper that his ship is overdue  that’ll do said fraser turning away  the men moved off slowly mr green’s reproaches being forestalled by the evidently genuine compliments of joe  if i’d got a ’ead like you willyum he said enviously i’d be a loryer or a serlicitor or somethink o’ the kind  days passed and ran into weeks but the golden cloud was still unspoken fraser got a paper every day when ashore but in vain until at length one morning at bittlesea in the news columns of the daily telegraph the name of the missing ship caught his eye he folded the paper hurriedly and breathed hard as he read—  missing ship golden cloud  rio janeiro thursday  the barque foxglove from melbourne to rio janeiro has just arrived with five men sole survivors of the ship golden cloud which they report as sunk in collision with a steamer name unknown ten weeks out from london their names are smith larsen petersen collins and gooch no others saved  in a dazed fashion he read the paragraph over and over again closely scanning the names of the rescued men then he went up on deck and beckoning to joe pointed with a trembling finger to the fatal paragraph joe read it slowly  and cap’in flower wasn’t one o’ them sir he asked pointing to the names  fraser shook his head and both men stood for some time in silence  he’s done it this time and no mistake said joe at last well ’e was a good sailorman and a kind master  he handed the paper back and returned to his work and to confer in a low voice with green who had been watching them fraser went back to the cabin and after sitting for some time in a brown study wrote off to poppy tyrell and enclosed the cutting  he saw her three days later and was dismayed and surprised to find her taxing herself with being the cause of the adventurous mariner’s death  he would never have heard of the golden cloud if it hadn’t been for me she said trembling his death is at my door  fraser tried to comfort her and straining metaphor to the utmost said that if the finger of providence had not made her oversleep herself she would undoubtedly have shared the same fate  the girl shook her head  he shipped before the mast for the sake of being on the same ship as i was she said with quivering lip it is not every man who would have done that and i—i—  overslept yourself said fraser consolingly  miss tyrell made an impatient gesture but listened hopefully as her visitor suggested that it was quite possible flower had got away in another boat  i’ll watch the paper every day she said brightening you miss some at sea  but nothing came of the watching the golden cloud had had its obituary in the paper in large type and that was all—a notice to certain women and children scattered about europe to go into mourning and to the owners to get another ship  by the end of the couple of months fraser had given up all hope he was very sorry for his unfortunate friend but his sorrow was at times almost tempered by envy as he pondered over the unexpected change which had come over his relations with poppy tyrell the old friendly footing had disappeared and her manner had become distant as though now that the only link which connected them was broken there was no need for further intercourse the stiffness which ensued made his visits more and more difficult at last he missed calling one night when he was in london and the next time he called the girl was out it was a fortnight before he saw her and the meeting was embarrassing to both  i’m sorry i was out last time you came said poppy  it didn’t matter said fraser  conversation came to a standstill miss tyrell with her toes on the fender gazed in a contemplative fashion at the fire i didn’t know—— began fraser who was still standing  he cleared his voice and began again i didn’t know whether you would rather i left off coming he said slowly  her gaze travelled slowly from the fire to his face you must please yourself she said quietly  i would rather please you he said steadily  the girl regarded him gravely it is rather inconvenient for you sometimes she suggested and i am afraid that i am not very good company  fraser shook his head eagerly it is not that at all he said hastily  poppy made no reply and there was another long silence then fraser advanced and held out his hand  goodbye he said quietly  goodbye said the girl she smiled brightly and got up to see him downstairs  i wanted to say something before i went said fraser slowly as he paused at the streetdoor and i will say it  miss tyrell raising her eyebrows somewhat at his vehemence waited patiently  i have loved you from the moment i saw you said fraser and i shall go on loving you till i die goodbye  he pressed her hand again and walked down the little front garden into the street at the gate he paused and looked round at poppy still standing in the lighted doorway he looked round again a few yards down the street and again farther on the girl still stood there in the momentary glimpse he had of her he fancied that her arm moved he came back hastily and miss tyrell regarded him with unmistakable surprise  i thought—you beckoned me he stammered  thought i beckoned you repeated the girl  i thought so murmured fraser i beg your pardon and turned confusedly to go again  so—i—did said a low voice  fraser turned suddenly and faced her then as the girl lowered her eyes before his he reentered the house and closing the door led her gently upstairs  i didn’t like you to go like that said miss tyrell in explanation as they entered her room  fraser regarded her steadfastly and her eyes smiled at him he drew her towards him and kissed her and miss tyrell trembling with something which might have been indignation hid her face on his shoulder  for a long time unless certain foolish ejaculations of fraser’s might count as conversation they stood silent then poppy extricating herself from his arm drew back and regarded him seriously  it is not right she said slowly you forget  it is quite right said fraser it is as right as anything can be  poppy shook her head it has been wrong all along she said soberly and captain flower is dead in consequence i never intended to go on the golden cloud but i let him go and now he’s dead he only went to be near me and while he was drowning i was going out with you i have been very wicked  fraser protested and taking her hand drew her gently towards him again  he was very good to my father said poppy struggling faintly i don’t think i can  you must said fraser doggedly i’m not going to lose you now it is no good looking at me like that it is too late  he kissed her again secretly astonished at his own audacity and the highhanded way in which he was conducting things mixed with his joy was a halfpang as he realised that he had lost his fear of poppy tyrell  i promised my father said the girl presently i did not want to get married but i did not mind so much until—  until fraser reminded her fondly  until it began to get near said the girl then i knew  she took her chair by the fire again and fraser placing his beside it they sat hand in hand discussing the future it was a comprehensive future and even included captain flower  if he should be alive after all said poppy with unmistakable firmness i shall still marry him if he wishes it  fraser assented if he should ever turn up again he said deliberately i will tell him all about it but it was his own desire that i should watch over you if anything happened to him so he is as much to blame as i am if he had lived i should never have said a word to you you know that  i know said poppy softly  her hand trembled in his and his grasp tightened as though nothing should loosen it but some thousands of miles away captain flower from the deck of a whaler was anxiously scanning the horizon in search of the sail which was to convey him back to england     chapter xxiii     time as it rolled on set at rest any doubts miss tyrell might have had concerning the fate of captain flower and under considerable pressure from fraser she had consented to marry him in june the only real reason for choosing that month was that it was close at hand though fraser supplied her with several others to choose from their engagement could hardly have been said to have been announced for with the exception of old mr fraser and the crew of the swallow who had gleaned the fact for themselves without any undue strain on their intellects there was nobody to tell  the boy was the first to discover it according to his own indignant account he went down to the cabin to see whether there was anything he could do and was promptly provided with three weeks’ hard labour by his indignant skipper a little dissertation in which he indulged in the forecastle on division of labour met with but scant response joe said that work was good for boys and mr green said that he knew a boy who worked eighteen hours a day and then used to do sums in his sleep to improve his education the other men set their wits to work then and proved to have so large an acquaintance with a type of boy that tommy loathed that he received a mild chastisement for impertinence to his elders and betters  it wanted but two days to the wedding the swallow was lying in the river her deck unoccupied except for mr green and the boy who were smoking in the bows and the ship’s cat which with one eye on mr green was stalking the fryingpan fraser had gone ashore on business connected with his weddinggarments and poppy tyrell with all her earthly belongings in a couple of boxes sat in the cabin dreaming of her future  a boat bumped against the side of the steamer and mr green looking round observed the long form of joe scrambling over the side his appearance betokened alarm and haste and mr green after a brief remark on the extravagance not to say lordliness of a waterman’s skiff when a hail would have taken the ship’s boat to him demanded to know what was the matter  send that boy below said joe hastily  what for enquired the gentleman interested rebelliously  you go below repeated joe sternly ’fore i take you by the scruff o’ your little neck and drop you down  the boy with a few remarks about the rights of man in general and ships’ boys in particular took his departure and joe taking the startled mr green by the arm led him farther aft  you’ve got a ’ead on you willyum i know he said in a fierce whisper  people have said so remarked the other modestly what’s the row  for answer joe pointed to the cabin and that with so much expression on his features that mr green following his gaze half expected to see something horrible emerge from the companion  it’s all up said the tall seaman poetically you can put the weddingdress away in brown paper and tell the church bells as there is no call for ’em to ring cap’n flower has turned up ag’in  what cried the astonished mr green  i see ’im replied joe i was just goin’ on the wharf as i passed to speak to old george when i see ’im talking to ’im he didn’t see me an’ i come off ’ere as fast as my legs could carry me now wot’s to be done you’ve got the ’eadpiece  mr green scratched the article in question and smiled feebly  on’y two days and they would ha’ been married said joe bit ’ard ain’t it i’m glad as i can be as he’s safe but he might ha’ waited a day or two longer  did george seem scared enquired his friend  wot’s that got to do with it demanded joe violently are you goin’ to set that ’eadpiece to work or are you not  mr green coughed confusedly and attempted to think with a brain which was already giddy with responsibility  i don’t want to do anything that isn’t straight and gentlemanly he remarked  straight repeated joe look ’ere cap’n fraser’s our old man ain’t he very good it’s our dooty to stand by ’im but besides that it’s for the young lady’s sake it’s easy to see that she’s as fond of him as she can be and she’s that sort o’ young lady that if she come up now and told me to jump overboard i’d do it  you could swim ashore easy asserted mr green  they was to be married thursday morning continued joe and now here’s cap’n flower and no ’eadpiece on the ship crool i call it  she’s a very nice young lady said the mortified mr green always a pleasant smile for everybody  he’ll come aboard ’ere as safe as heggs is heggs said joe despondently wot’s to be done  he folded his arms on the side and stood ruefully watching the stairs he was quite confident that there were headpieces walking the earth to which a satisfactory solution of this problem would have afforded no difficulty whatever and he shook his own sadly as he thought of its limitations  it only wants a little artfulness willyum he suggested encouragingly  get hold of him and make him drunk for three days murmured mr green in a voice so low that he half hoped joe would not hear it  and then boil ’im said the indignant seaman without looking round ah here he comes now you’ve got to be astonished mind but don’t make a noise in case it fetches the young lady up  he pointed to the stairs and his friend going to his side saw a passenger just stepping into a boat the two men then turned away until at sight of captain flower’s head appearing above the side they went off into such silent manifestations of horror and astonishment that he feared for their reason  it’s ’is voice said joe hastily as flower bawled out to them with inconsiderate loudness i never thought to see you ag’in sir i ’eard you was drowned months and months ago  he took the captain’s proffered hand somewhat awkwardly and stood closely scanning him the visitor was bronzed with southern suns and looked strong and well his eye was bright and his manner retained all its old easy confidence  ah i’ve been through something since i saw you last my lad he said shaking his head the great thing is joe to always keep your head above water  yessir said the seaman slowly but i ’eard as ’ow you went down with the golden cloud sir  so i did said flower somewhat boastfully and came up again with the nearest land a mile or two under my feet it was dark but the sea was calm and i could see the brute that sunk us keeping on her way then i saw a hencoop bobbing up and down close by and i got to it just in time and hung on to it until i could get my breath again and shout i heard a hail a little way off and byandby i got alongside two of our chaps making themselves comfortable on two or three spars there were three drowned fowls in my coop and we finished them on the fourth day just as a whaler hove in sight and took us off we were on her over four months and then we sighted the barque california homeward bound and she brought us home i landed at the albert docks this morning and here i am hard as nails  joe with a troubled eye in the direction of the cabin murmured that it did him credit and mrgreen made a low hissing noise intended to signify admiration flower with a cheery smile looked round the deck  where’s fraser he enquired  he’s ashore sir said joe hastily i don’t know when he’ll be back  never mind i’ll wait was the reply george was telling me he is to be married on thursday  joe gasped and eyed him closely  so i’ve ’eard sir  and captain barber’s married too george tells me said flower i suppose that’s right  so i’ve ’eard sir said joe again  flower turned and paced a little up and down the deck deep in thought he had arrived in london three hours before to find that poppy had left her old lodgings without leaving any clue as to her whereabouts then he had gone on to the wheelers without any result so far as he was concerned although the screams of the unfortunate mrs wheeler were still ringing in his ears  i’ll go down below and wait he said stopping before the men tell fraser i’m there or else he’ll be startled i nearly killed poor old george the man’s got no pluck at all  he moved slowly towards the cabin and poppy leaving the men exchanging glances of hopeless consternation then as he turned to descend the desperate joe ran up and laid a detaining hand on his sleeve  you can’t go down there he whispered and dragged him forcibly away  why not demanded the other struggling let go you fool  he wrenched himself free and stood gazing angrily at the excited seaman  there’s a lady down there said the latter in explanation  well i sha’n’t eat her said the indignant flower don’t you put your hands on me again my lad or you’ll repent it who is it  joe eyed him helplessly and with a dim idea of putting off the discovery as long as possible mysteriously beckoned him forward  who is it asked the puzzled flower advancing a pace or two  the seaman hesitated then a sudden inspiration born of the memories of last year’s proceedings seized him and he shook with the brilliancy of it he looked significantly at mr green and his voice trembled with excitement  the lady who used to come down to the foam asking for mr robinson he stammered  what said the dismayed flower coming briskly forward and interposing two masts the funnel and the galley between himself and the cabin why on earth didn’t you say so before  well i didn’t know what to do sir said joe humbly it ain’t for the likes of me to interfere  flower knit his brows and tapped the deck with his foot  what’s she doing down there he said irritably she’s not going to marry fraser is she  joe gulped  yessir he said promptly  yessir said mr green with an intuitive feeling that a lie of such proportions required backing  flower stood in amaze pondering the situation and a grin slowly broke the corners of his mouth  don’t tell fraser i’ve been here he said at length  no sir said joe eagerly  i’ll see him in a day or two said flower after he’s married you understand me joe  yessir said joe again shall i put you ashore sir  he was almost dancing with impatience lest fraser or poppy should spoil his plans by putting in an appearance but before flower could reply mr green gave a startled exclamation and the captain with a readiness born of his adventures of the last year promptly vanished down the forecastle as miss tyrell appeared on deck joe closed the scuttle and with despair gnawing at his vitals sat on it  unconscious of the interest she was exciting poppy tyrell who had tired of the solitude of the cabin took a seat on a campstool and folding her hands in her lap sat enjoying the peace and calm of the summer evening joe saw defeat in the very moment of victory even while he sat the garrulous tommy might be revealing state secrets to the credulous flower  get her down below he whispered fiercely to mr green quick  his friend stared at him aghast but made no movement he looked at the unconscious poppy and then back at the mouthing figure seated on the scuttle his brain was numbed then a little performance on charlie’s part a week or two before which had cost that gentleman his berth occurred to him and he moved slowly forward  for a moment the astonished joe gazed at him in wrathful bewilderment then his brow cleared and his old estimate of his friend was revived again mr green lurched rather than walked and getting as far as the galley steadied himself with one hand and stood with a foolish smile swaying lightly in the breeze from the galley he got with great care to the side of the ship opposite poppy and clutching the shrouds beamed on her amiably the girl gave one rapid glance at him and then as he tottered to the wheel and hung on by the spokes turned her head away what it cost the wellbred mr green to stagger as he came by her again and then roll helplessly at her feet will never be known and he groaned in spirit as the girl with one scornful glance in his direction rose quietly and went below again  satisfied that the coast was clear he rose to his feet and signalled hurriedly to joe then he mounted sentry over the companion grinning feebly at the success of his manoeuvres as he heard a door closed and locked below  you pull me round to the wharf joe said flower as he tumbled hurriedly into the boat i don’t want to run into fraser and i just want to give old george the tip to keep quiet for a day or two  the seaman obeyed readily and exchanged a triumphant glance with mr green as they shot by the steamer’s stern his invention was somewhat tried by flower’s questions on the way to the wharf but he answered them satisfactorily and left him standing on the jetty imparting to george valuable thoughts on the maxim that speech is silver and silence golden  joe tried a few of the principal points with tommy upon his return to the steamer the necessity for using compliments instead of threats to a ship’s boy being very galling to his proud nature  you be a good boy like you always ’ave been tommy he said with a kindly smile and don’t breathe a word about wot’s ’appened this evening and ’ere’s a tanner for you to spend—a whole tanner  tommy bit it carefully and placing it in his pocket whistled thoughtfully  fill your pipe out o’ that young ’un said mr green proffering his pouch with a flourish  the boy complied and putting a few reserve charges in his pocket looked up at him shrewdly  is it very partikler he enquired softly  partikler repeated joe i should think it is he can’t think ’ow partikler it is can ’e willyum  mr green shook his head  it’s worth more than a tanner then said tommy briskly  look ’ere said joe suppressing his natural instincts by a strong effort you keep quiet for three days and i’ll be a friend to you for life and so will willyum won’t you old man  mr green with a smile of rare condescension said that he would  look ’ere said the bargainer i’ll tell you what i’ll do for you you gimme another tanner each instead and that’s letting you off cheap ’cos your friendship ’ud be worth pounds and pounds to anybody what wanted it  he gazed firmly at his speechless wouldbe friends and waited patiently until such time as their emotion would permit of a reply joe was the first to speak and tommy listened unmoved to a description of himself which would have made a jellyfish blush  tanner each he said simply i don’t want friends who can talk like that to save sixpence  mr green with a sarcasm which neither tommy nor joe understood gave him the amount in coppers his friend followed suit and the boy having parted with his reputation at a fair price went below whistling  fraser came on board soon afterwards and mr green with his celebrated drunken scene fresh in his mind waited nervously for developments none ensuing he confided to joe his firm conviction that miss tyrell was a young lady worth dying for and gloomily wondered whether fraser was good enough for her after which both men somewhat elated fell to comparing headpieces  joe was in a state of nervous tension while steam was getting up and glued to the side of the steamer strained his eyes gazing at the dimlylit stairs as they steamed rapidly down the river his spirits rose and he said vaguely that something inside him seemed to tell him that his trouble would not be in vain  there’s two days yet said mr green i wish they was well over  captain flower who had secured a bed at the three sisters’ hotel in aldgate was for widely different reasons wishing the same thing his idea was to waylay fraser immediately after the marriage and obtain poppy’s address his natural vanity leading him to believe that miss tipping would at once insist upon a change of bridegroom if she heard of his safety before the ceremony was performed in these circumstances he had to control his impatience as best he could and with a view to preventing his safety becoming known too soon postponed writing to his uncle until the day before the wedding     chapter xxiv     he posted his letter in the morning and after a midday meal took train to seabridge and here the reception of which he had dreamed for many weary months awaited him the news of his escape had spread round the town like wildfire and he had hardly stepped out of the train before the stationmaster was warmly shaking hands with him the porters followed suit the only man who displayed any hesitation being the porter from the lamproom who patted him on the back several times before venturing the centre of a little enthusiastic knot of fellowtownsmen he could hardly get clear to receive the hearty grip of captain barber or the chaste salute with which mrs barber inaugurated her auntship but he got free at last and taking an arm of each set off blithely down the road escorted by neighbours  as far as the cottage their journey was a veritable triumphal progress and it was some time before the adventuresome mariner was permitted to go inside but he got free at last and mrs barber with a hazy idea of the best way to treat a shipwrecked fellowcreature however remote the accident placed before him a joint of cold beef and a quantity of hot coffee it was not until he had made a good meal and lit his pipe that uncle barber first quaffing a couple of glasses of ale to nerve himself for harrowing details requested him to begin at the beginning and go right on  his nephew complied the tale which he had told poppy serving him as far as riga after which a slight collision off the nore at night between the brig which was bringing him home and the golden cloud enabled him to climb into the bows of that illfated vessel before she swung clear again there was a slight difficulty here captain barber’s views of british seamen making no allowance for such a hasty exchange of ships but as it appeared that flower was at the time still suffering from the effects of the fever which had seized him at riga he waived the objection and listened in silence to the end of the story  fancy what he must have suffered said mrsbarber shivering and then to turn up safe and sound a twelvemonth afterwards he ought tomake a book of it  it’s all in a sailorman’s dooty said captain barber shaking his head it’s wot ’e expects  his wife rose and talking the while proceeded to clear the table the old man closed the door after her and with a glance at his nephew gave a jerk of the head towards the kitchen  wonderful woman your aunt he said impressively but i was one too many for ’er  flower stared  how he enquired briefly  married ’er said the old man chuckling you wouldn’t believe wot a lot there was arter her i got ’er afore she knew where she was a’most if i was to tell you all that there was arter’er you’d hardly believe me  i daresay said the other  there’s good news and bad news continued captain barber shaking his head and coughing a bit with his pipe i’ve got a bit o’ bad for you  flower waited  ’lizabeth’s married said the old man slowly married that stupid young gibson she’ll be sorry enough now i know  his nephew looked down i’ve heard about it he said with an attempt at gloom old george told me  the old man respecting his grief smoked on for some time in silence then he got up and patted him on the shoulder  i’m on the lookout for you he said kindly there’s a niece o’ your aunt’s i ain’t seen her yet but your aunt praises of her so she’s all right i’ll tell your aunt to ask ’er over your aunt ses—  how many aunts have i got demanded flower with sudden irritation  the old man raised his eyebrows and stared at him in offended amazement  you’re not yourself fred he said slowly your misfortunes ’ave shook you up you’ve got one aunt and one uncle what brought you up and did the best for you ever since you was so ’igh  so you did said flower heartily i didn’t mean to speak like that but i’m tired and worried  i see you was said his uncle amiably but your aunt’s a wonderful woman she’s got a business ’ead and we’re doing well i’m buying another schooner and you can ’ave her or have the foam back which you like  flower thanked him warmly and mrs barber returning he noticed with some surprise the evident happiness of the couple for whose marriage he was primarily responsible he had to go over his adventures again and again captain barber causing much inconvenience and delay at suppertime by using the beerjug to represent the golden cloud and a dish of hot sausages the unknown craft which sank her flower was uncertain which to admire most the tactful way in which mrs barber rescued the sausages or the readiness with which his uncle pushed a plate over a fresh stain on the tablecloth  supper finished he sat silently thinking of poppy not quite free from the fear that she might have followed him to new zealand by another boat the idea made him nervous and the suspense became unendurable he took up his cap and strolled out into the stillness of the evening seabridge seemed strange to him after his long absence and under present conditions melancholy there was hardly a soul to be seen but a murmur of voices came through the open windows of the thorn and a clumsy cart jolted and creaked its way up the darkening road  he stood for some time looking down on the quay and the shadowy shapes of one or two small craft lying in the river the foam was in her old berth and a patch of light aft showed that the cabin was occupied he walked down to her and stepping noiselessly aboard peered through the open skylight at ben as he sat putting a fresh patch in a pair of trousers it struck him that the old man might know something of the events which had led up to fraser’s surprising marriage and his curiosity being somewhat keen on the point he descended to glean particulars  ben’s favourite subject was the misdeeds of the crew and the steps which a kind but firm mate had to take to control them and he left it unwillingly to discuss fraser’s marriage of which faint rumours had reached his ears it was evident that he knew nothing of the particulars and flower with some carefulness proceeded to put leading questions  did you ever see anything more of those women who used to come down to the ship after a man named robinson he enquired carelessly  they come down one night soon arter you fell overboard replied the old man very polite they was and they asked me to go and see ’em any time i liked i ain’t much of a one for seeing people but i did go one night ’bout two or three months ago end o’ march i think it was to a pub wot they ’ave at chelsea to see whether they ’ad heard anything of ’im  ah interjected the listener  they was very short about it continued ben sourly the old party got that excited she could ’ardly keep still but the young lady she said good riddance to bad rubbish she ses she hoped as ’ow he’d be punished  flower started and then smiled softly to himself  perhaps she’s found somebody else he said  ben grunted  i shouldn’t wonder she seemed very much took up with a young feller she called arthur he said slowly but that was the last i see of ’em they never even offered me a drink and though they’d ask me to go down any time i liked they was barely civil the young lady didn’t seem to me to want arthur to ’ear about it  he stitched away resentfully and his listener after a fond look round his old quarters bade him goodnight and went ashore again for a little while he walked up and down the road pausing once to glance at the bright drawn blind in the gibsons’ window and then returned home captain barber and his wife were at cribbage and intent upon the game  with the morning sun his spirits rose and after a hurried breakfast he set off for the station and booked to bittlesea the little platform was bright with roses and the air full of the sweetness of an early morning in june he watched the long line stretching away until it was lost in a bend of the road and thought out ways and means of obtaining a private interview with the happy bridegroom a subject which occupied him long after the train had started as he was benevolently anxious not to mar his friend’s happiness by a display of useless grief and temper on the part of the bride  the wedding party left the house shortly before his arrival at the station after a morning of excitement and suspense which had tried messrs smith and green to the utmost both being debarred by selfimposed etiquette from those alluring liquids by which in other circumstances they would have soothed their nerves they strolled restlessly about with tommy for whom they had suddenly conceived an ardent affection and who to do him justice was taking fullest advantage of the fact  they felt a little safer when a brougham dashed up to the house and carried off fraser and his supporter and safer still when his father appeared with poppy tyrell on his arm blushing sweetly and throwing a glance in their direction which was like to have led to a quarrel until tommy created a diversion by stating that it was intended for him  by the time flower arrived the road was clear and the house had lapsed into its accustomed quiet  an old seafaring man whose interest in weddings had ceased three days after his own indicated the house with the stem of his pipe it was an old house with a broad step and a wideopen door and on the step a small servant in a huge cap with her hands clasped together stood gazing excitedly up the road  cap’n fraser live here enquired flower after a cautious glance at the windows  yes sir said the small servant he’s getting married at this very instant  you’ll be married one of these days if you’re a good girl said flower who was in excellent humour  the small girl forgot her cap and gave her head a toss then she regarded him thoughtfully and after adjusting the cap smoothed down her apron and said she was in no hurry she never took any notice of them  flower looked round and pondered he was anxious if possible to see fraser and catch the first train back  cap’n fraser was in good spirits i suppose he said cautiously  very good spirits admitted the small servant but nervous  and miss tipping suggested flower  miss who enquired the small girl with a superior smile miss tyrell you mean don’t you  flower stared at her in astonishment no miss tipping he said sharply the bride is miss tyrell here too  the small girl was astonished in her turn miss tyrell is the bride she said dwelling fondly on the last word who’s miss tipping  what’s the bride’s christian name demanded flower catching her fiercely by the hand’  he was certain of the reply before the now thoroughly frightened small girl could find breath enough to utter it and at the word poppy he turned without a word and ran up the road then he stopped and coming back hastily called out to her for the whereabouts of the church  straight up there and second turning on the left cried the small girl her fear giving place to curiosity what’s the matter  but flower was running doggedly up the road thinking in a confused fashion as he ran at first he thought that joe had blundered then as he remembered his manner and his apparent haste to get rid of him amazement and anger jostled each other in his mind out of breath his pace slackened to a walk and then broke into a run again as he turned the corner and the church came into view  there was a small cluster of people in the porch which was at once reduced by two and a couple of carriages drawn up against the curb he arrived breathless and peered in a few spectators were in the seats but the chancel was empty  they’re gone into the vestry whispered an aged but frivolous woman who was grimly waiting with a huge bag of rice  flower turned white no efforts of his could avail now and he smiled bitterly as he thought of his hardships of the past year there was a lump in his throat and a sense of unreality about the proceedings which was almost dreamlike he looked up the sunny road with its sleepy oldtime houses and then at the group standing in the porch wondering dimly that a deformed girl on crutches should be smiling as gaily as though the wedding were her own and that yellow wrinkled old women should wilfully come to remind themselves of their longdead youth his whole world seemed suddenly desolate and unreal and it was only borne in upon him slowly that there was no need now for his journey to london in search of poppy and that henceforth her movements could possess no interest for him he ranged himself quietly with the bystanders and not without a certain dignity waited  it seemed a long time the horses champed and rattled their harness the bystanders got restless then there was a movement  he looked in the church again and saw them coming down the aisle fraser smiling and erect with poppy’s little hand upon his arm she looked down at first smiling shyly but as they drew near the door gave her husband a glance such as flower had never seen before he caught his breath then and stood up erect as the bridegroom himself and as they reached the door they both saw him at the same instant poppy with a startled cry of joy and surprise half drew her arm from her husband’s fraser gazed at him as on one risen from the dead  for a space they regarded each other without a word then fraser with his wife on his arm took a step towards him flower still regarding them steadily drew back a little and moved by a sudden impulse and that new sense of dignity snatched a handful of rice from the old woman’s bag and threw it over them  then he turned quickly and with rapid strides made his way back to the station                                    ————
