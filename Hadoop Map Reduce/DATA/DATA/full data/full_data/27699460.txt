27699460	the young forester  by zane grey     i choosing a profession  i loved outdoor life and hunting some way a grizzly bear would come in when i tried to explain forestry to my brother  hunting grizzlies he cried why ken father says youve been reading dime novels  just wait hal till he comes out here ill show him that forestry isnt just bearhunting  my brother hal and i were camping a few days on the susquehanna river and we had divided the time between fishing and tramping our camp was on the edge of a forest some eight miles from harrisburg the property belonged to our father and he had promised to drive out to see us but he did not come that day and i had to content myself with winning hal over to my side  ken if the governor lets you go to arizona cant you ring me in  not this summer id be afraid to ask him but in another year ill do it  wont it be great but what a long time to wait it makes me sick to think of you out there riding mustangs and hunting bears and lions  youll have to stand it youre pretty much of a kid halnot yet fourteen besides ive graduated  kid exclaimed hal hotly youre not such a methuselah yourself im nearly as big as you i can ride as well and play ball as well and i can beat you all  hold on hal i want you to help me to persuade father and if you get your temper up youll like as not go against me if he lets me go ill bring you in as soon as i dare thats a promise i guess i know how much id like to have you  all right replied hal resignedly ill have to hold in i suppose but im crazy to go and ken the cowboys and lions are not all that interest me i like what you tell me about forestry but who ever heard of forestry as a profession  its just this way hal the natural resources have got to be conserved and the government is trying to enlist intelligent young men in the workparticularly in the department of forestry im not exaggerating when i say the prosperity of this country depends upon forestry  i have to admit that i was repeating what i had read  why does it tell me how demanded hal  because the lumbermen are wiping out all the timber and never thinking of the future they are in such a hurry to get rich that theyll leave their grandchildren only a desert they cut and slash in every direction and then fires come and the country is ruined our rivers depend upon the forests for water the trees draw the rain the leaves break it up and let it fall in mists and drippings it seeps into the ground and is held by the roots if the trees are destroyed the rain rushes off on the surface and floods the rivers the forests store up water and they do good in other ways  weve got to have wood and lumber said hal  of course we have but there wont be any unless we go in for forestry its been practiced in germany for three hundred years  we spent another hour talking about it and if hals practical sense which he inherited from father had not been offset by his real love for the forests i should have been discouraged hal was of an industrious turn of mind he meant to make money and anything that was good business appealed strongly to him but finally he began to see what i was driving at he admitted that there was something in the argument  the late afternoon was the best time for fishing for the next two hours our thoughts were of quivering rods and leaping bass  youll miss the big bass this august remarked hal laughing guess you wont have all the sport  thats so hal i replied regretfully but were talking as if it were a dead sure thing that im going west well i only hope so  what hal and i liked best about campingof course after the fishingwas to sit around the campfire tonight it was more pleasant than ever and when darkness fully settled down it was even thrilling we talked about bears then hal told of mountainlions and the habit they have of creeping stealthily after hunters there was a hootowl crying dismally up in the woods and down by the edge of the river brightgreen eyes peered at us from the darkness when the wind came up and moaned through the trees it was not hard to imagine we were out in the wilderness this had been a favorite game for hal and me only tonight there seemed some reality about it from the way hal whispered and listened and looked he might very well have been expecting a visit from lions or for that matter even from indians finally we went to bed but our slumbers were broken hal often had nightmares even on ordinary nights and on this one he moaned so much and thrashed about the tent so desperately that i knew the lions were after him  i dreamed of forest lands with snowcapped peaks rising in the background i dreamed of elk standing on the open ridges of whitetailed deer trooping out of the hollows of antelope browsing on the sage at the edge of the forests here was the broad track of a grizzly in the snow there on a sunny crag lay a tawny mountainlion asleep the bronzed cowboy came in for his share and the lone bandit played his part in a way to make me shiver the great pines the shady brown trails the sunlit glades were as real to me as if i had been among them most vivid of all was the lonely forest at night and the campfire i heard the sputter of the red embers and smelled the wood smoke i peered into the dark shadows watching and listening for i knew not what  on the next day early in the afternoon father appeared on the river road  there he is cried hal hes driving billy how hes coming  billy was fathers fastest horse it pleased me immensely to see the pace for father would not have been driving fast unless he were in a particularly good humor and when he stopped on the bank above camp i could have shouted he wore his corduroys as if he were ready for outdoor life there was a smile on his face as he tied billy and coming down he poked into everything in camp and asked innumerable questions hal talked about the bass until i was afraid he would want to go fishing and postpone our forestry tramp in the woods but presently he spoke directly to me  well kenneth are you going to come out with the truth about that wildwest scheme of yours now that youve graduated you want a fling you want to ride mustangs to see cowboys to hunt and shootall that sort of thing  when father spoke in such a way it usually meant the defeat of my schemes i grew cold all over  yes father id like all thatbut i mean business i want to be a forest ranger let me go to arizona this summer and in the fall idid like to go to a school of forestry  there the truth was out and my feelings were divided between relief and fear before father could reply i launched into a set speech upon forestry and talked till i was out of breath  theres something in what you say replied my father youve been reading up on the subject  everything i could get and ive been trying to apply my knowledge in the woods i love the trees id love an outdoor life but forestry wont be any picnic a ranger must be able to ride and pack make trail and camp live alone in the woods fight fire and wild beasts oh itd be great  i dare say said father dryly particularly the riding and shooting well i guess youll make a goodenough doctor to suit me  give me a square deal i cried jumping up maynt i have one word to say about my future wouldnt you rather have me happy and successful as a forester even if there is danger than just an ordinary poor doctor lets go over our woodland ill prove that you are letting your forest run down youve got sixty acres of hard woods that ought to be bringing a regular income if i cant prove it if i cant interest you ill agree to study medicine but if i do youre to let me try forestry  well kenneth thats a fair proposition returned father evidently surprised at my earnestness come on well go up in the woods hal i suppose hes won you over  kens got a big thing in mind replied hal loyally its just splendid  i never saw the long blackfringed line of trees without joy in the possession of them and a desire to be among them the sixty acres of timber land covered the whole of a swampy valley spread over a rolling hill sloping down to the glistening river  now son go ahead said my father as we clambered over a rail fence and stepped into the edge of shade  well father i began haltingly and could not collect my thoughts then we were in the cool woods it was very still there being only a faint rustling of leaves and the mellow note of a hermitthrush the deep shadows were lightened by shafts of sunshine which here and there managed to pierce the canopy of foliage somehow the feeling roused by these things loosened my tongue  this is an old hardwood forest i began much of the white oak hickory ash maple is virgin timber these trees have reached maturity many are dead at the tops all of them should have been cut long ago they make too dense a shade for the seedlings to survive look at that bunch of sapling maples see how they reach up trying to get to the light they havent a branch low down and the tops are thin yet maple is one of our hardiest trees growth has been suppressed do you notice there are no small oaks or hickories just here they cant live in deep shade heres the stump of a white oak cut last fall it was about two feet in diameter lets count the rings to find its ageabout ninety years it flourished in its youth and grew rapidly but it had a hard time after about fifty years at that time it was either burned or mutilated by a falling tree or struck by lightning  now how do you make that out asked father intensely interested  see the free wide rings from the pith out to about number fortyfive the tree was healthy up to that time then it met with an injury of some kind as is indicated by this black scar after that the rings grew narrower the tree struggled to live  we walked on with me talking as fast as i could get the words out i showed father a giant bushy chestnut which was dominating all the trees around it and told him how it retarded their growth on the other hand the other trees were absorbing nutrition from the ground that would have benefited the chestnut  theres a sinful waste of wood here i said as we climbed over and around the windfalls and rotting treetrunks the old trees die and are blown down the amount of rotting wood equals the yearly growth now i want to show you the worst enemies of the trees heres a big white oak a hundred and fifty years old its almost dead see the little holes bored in the bark they were made by a beetle look  i swung my hatchet and split off a section of bark everywhere in the bark and round the tree ran little dustfilled grooves i pried out a number of tiny brown beetles somewhat the shape of a pinchingbug only very much smaller  there youd hardly think that that great tree was killed by a lot of little bugs would you they girdle the trees and prevent the sap from flowing  i found an old chestnut which contained nests of the deadly white moths and explained how it laid its eggs and how the caterpillars that came from them killed the trees by eating the leaves i showed how mice and squirrels injured the forest by eating the seeds  first id cut and sell all the matured and dead timber then id thin out the spreading trees that want all the light and the saplings that grow too close together id get rid of the beetles and try to check the spread of caterpillars for trees grow twice as fast if they are not choked or diseased then id keep planting seeds and shoots in the open places taking care to favor the species best adapted to the soil and cutting those that dont grow well in this way well be keeping our forest while doubling its growth and value and having a yearly income from it  kenneth i see youre in dead earnest about this business said my father slowly before i came out here today i had been looking up the subject and i believe with you that forestry really means the salvation of our country i think you are really interested and ive a mind not to oppose you  youll never regret it ill learn ill work up then its an outdoor lifehealthy freewhy all the boys ive told take to the idea theres something fine about it forestry it is then replied he i like the promise of it and i like your attitude if you have learned so much while you were camping out here the past few summers it speaks well for you but why do you want to go to arizona  because the best chances are out west id like to get a line on the national forests there before i go to college the work will be different those western forests are all pine ive a friend dick leslie a fellow i used to fish with who went west and is now a fire ranger in the new national forest in arizonapenetier is the name of it he has written me several times to come out and spend a while with him in the woods  penetier where is thatnear what town  holston its a pretty rough country dick says plenty of deer bears and lions on his range so i could hunt some while studying the forests i think id be safe with dick even if it is wild out there  all right ill let you go when you return well see about the college then he surprised me by drawing a letter from his pocket and handing it to me my friend mr white got this letter from the department at washington it may be of use to you out there  so it was settled and when father drove off homeward hal and i went back to camp it would have been hard to say which of us was the more excited hal did a war dance round the campfire i was glad however that he did not have the little twinge of remorse which i experienced for i had not told him or father all that dick had written about the wilderness of penetier i am afraid my mind was as much occupied with rifles and mustangs as with the study of forestry but though the adventure called most strongly to me i knew i was sincere about the forestry end of it and i resolved that i would never slight my opportunities so smothering conscience i fell to the delight of making plans i was for breaking camp at once but hal persuaded me to stay one more day we talked for hours only one thing bothered me hal was jolly and glum by turns he reveled in the plans for my outfit but he wanted his own chance a thousand times i had to repeat my promise and the last thing he said before we slept was ken youre going to ring me in next summer     ii the man on the train  travelling was a new experience to me and on the first night after i left home i lay awake until we reached altoona we rolled out of smoky pittsburg at dawn and from then on the only bitter drop in my cup of bliss was that the train went so fast i could not see everything out of my window  four days to ride the great mississippi to cross the plains the rocky mountains then the arizona plateausa long long journey with a wild pine forest at the end i wondered what more any young fellow could have wished with my face glued to the car window i watched the level country speed by  there appeared to be one continuous procession of wellcultivated farms little hamlets and prosperous towns what interested me most of course were the farms for all of them had some kind of wood we passed a zone of maple forests which looked to be more carefully kept than the others then i recognized that they were maplesugar trees the farmers had cleaned out the other species and this primitive method of forestry had produced the finest maples it had ever been my goodfortune to see indiana was flatter than ohio not so well watered and therefore less heavily timbered i saw with regret that the woodland was being cut regularly tree after tree and stacked in cords for firewood  at chicago i was to change for santa fe and finding my train in the station i climbed aboard my car was a tourist coach father had insisted on buying a ticket for the california limited but i had argued that a luxurious pullman was not exactly the thing for a prospective forester still i pocketed the extra money which i had assured him he need not spend for the firstclass ticket  the huge station with its glaring lights and clanging bells and the outspreading city soon gave place to prairie land  that night i slept little but the very time i wanted to be awakewhen we crossed the mississippii was slumbering soundly and so missed it  ill bet i dont miss it coming back i vowed  the sight of the missouri however somewhat repaid me for the loss what a muddy wide river and i thought of the thousands of miles of country it drained and of the forests there must be at its source then came the neverending kansas cornfields i do not know whether it was their length or their treeless monotony but i grew tired looking at them  from then on i began to take some notice of my fellowtravelers the conductor proved to be an agreeable old fellow and the trainboy though i mistrusted his advances because he tried to sell me everything from chewinggum to mining stock turned out to be pretty good company the negro porter had such a jolly voice and laugh that i talked to him whenever i got the chance then occasional passengers occupied the seat opposite me from town to town they were much alike all sunburned and loudvoiced and it looked as though they had all bought their high boots and wide hats at the same shop  the last traveller to face me was a very heavy man with a great bullet head and a shock of light hair his blue eyes had a bold flash his long mustache drooped and there was something about him that i did not like he wore a huge diamond in the bosom of his flannel shirt and a leather watchchain that was thick and strong enough to have held up a townclock  hot he said as he mopped his moist brow  not so hot as it was i replied  sure not were climbin a little hes whistlin for dodge city now  dodge city i echoed with interest the name brought back vivid scenes from certain yellowbacked volumes and certain uncomfortable memories of my fathers displeasure isnt this the old cattle town where there used to be so many fights  sure an not so very long ago here look out the window he clapped his big hand on my knee then pointed see that hill there dead mans hill it was once where they buried the fellers as died with their boots on  i stared and even stretched my neck out of the window  yes old dodge was sure lively he continued as our train passed on i seen a little mixup there myself in the early eighties five cowpunchers friends they was had been visitin town one feller playfullike takes another fellers quirtthats a whip an the other feller playfullike says give it back then they tussles for it an rolls on the ground i was laughin as was everybody when suddenly the owner of the quirt thumps his friend both cowboys got up slow an watchin of each other then the first feller who had started the play pulls his gun hed hardly flashed it when they all pulls guns an it was some noisy an smoky in about five seconds there was five dead cowpunchers killed themselves as you might say just for fun thats what life was worth in old dodge after this story i felt more kindly disposed ward my travelling companion and would have asked for more romances but the conductor came along and engaged him in conversation then my neighbor across the aisle a young fellow not much older than myself asked me to talk to him  why yes if you like i replied in surprise he was pale there were red spots in his cheeks and dark lines under his weary eyes  you look so strong and eager that its done me good to watch you he explained with a sad smile you seeim sick  i told him i was very sorry and hoped he would get well soon  i ought to have come west sooner he replied but i couldnt get the money  he looked up at me and then out of the window at the sun setting red across the plains i tried to make him think of something beside himself but i made a mess of it the meeting with him was a shock to me long after dark when i had stretched out for the night i kept thinking of him and contrasting what i had to look forward to with his dismal future somehow it did not seem fair and i could not get rid of the idea that i was selfish  next day i had my first sight of real mountains and the pennsylvania hills that all my life had appeared so high dwindled to nothing at trinidad where we stopped for breakfast i walked out on the platform sniffing at the keen thin air when we crossed the raton mountains into new mexico the sick boy got off at the first station and i waved goodbye to him as the train pulled out then the mountains and the funny little adobe huts and the pueblo indians along the line made me forget everything else  the big man with the heavy watchchain was still on the train and after he had read his newspaper he began to talk to me  this road follows the old trail that the goldseekers took in fortynine he said were comin soon to a place apache pass where the apaches used to ambush the wagontrains its somewheres along here  presently the train wound into a narrow yellow ravine the walls of which grew higher and higher  them apaches was the worst redskins ever in the west they used to hide on top of this pass an shoot down on the wagontrains  later in the day he drew my attention to a mountain standing all by itself it was shaped like a cone green with trees almost to the summit and ending in a bare stone peak that had a flat top  starvation peak he said that names three hundred years old dates back to the time the spaniards owned this land theres a story about it thats likely true enough some spaniards were attacked by indians an climbed to the peak expectin to be better able to defend themselves up there the indians camped below the peak an starved the spaniards stuck there till they starved to death thats where it got its name  those times you tell of must have been great i said regretfully id like to have been here then but isnt the country all settled now arent the indians dead theres no more fighting  its not like it used to be but theres still warm places in the west not that the indians break out often any more but bad men are almost as bad if not so plentiful as when billy the kid run these parts i saw two men shot an another knifed jest before i went east to st louis  where  in arizona holston is the station where i get off an it happened near there  holston is where im going  you dont say well im glad to meet you young man my names buell an im some known in holston whats your name  he eyed me in a sharp but not unfriendly manner and seemed pleased to learn of my destination  ward kenneth ward im from pennsylvania  you havent got the bugs any one can see that he said and as i looked puzzled he went on with a smile and a sounding rap on his chest most young fellers as come out here have consumption they call it bugs i reckon youre seekin your fortune  yes in a way  theres opportunities for husky youngsters out here whatre you goin to rustle for if i may ask  im going in for forestry  forestry do you mean lumberin  no forestry is rather the opposite of lumbering im going in for government forestryto save the timber not cut it  it seemed to me he gave a little start of surprise he certainly straightened up and looked at me hard  whats government forestry  i told him to the best of my ability he listened attentively enough but thereafter he had not another word for me and presently he went into the next car i took his manner to be the western abruptness that i had heard of and presently forgot him in the scenery along the line at albuquerque i got off for a trip to a lunchcounter and happened to take a seat next to him  know anybody in holston he asked  as i could not speak because of a mouthful of sandwich i shook my head for the moment i had forgotten about dick leslie and when it did occur to me some indians offering to sell me beads straightway drove it out of my mind again  when i awoke the next day it was to see the sage ridges and red buttes of arizona we were due at holston at eight oclock but owing to a crippled engine the train was hours late at last i fell asleep to be awakened by a vigorous shake  holston your stop holston the conductor was saying  all right i said sitting up and then making a grab for my grip were pretty late arent we  six hours its two oclock  hope i can get a room i said as i followed him out on the platform he held up his lantern so that the light would shine in my face theres a hotel down the street a block or so better hurry and look sharp holstons not a safe place for a stranger at night  i stepped off into a windy darkness a lamp glimmered in the station window by its light i made out several men the foremost of whom had a dark pointed face and glittering eyes he wore a strange hat and i knew from pictures i had seen that he was a mexican then the bulky form of buell loomed up i called but evidently he did not hear me the men took his grips and they moved away to disappear in the darkness while i paused hoping to see some one to direct me the train puffed out leaving me alone on the platform  when i turned the corner i saw two dim lights one far to the left the other to the right and the black outline of buildings under what appeared to be the shadow of a mountain it was the quietest and darkest town i had ever struck  i decided to turn toward the righthand light for the conductor had said down the street i set forth at a brisk pace but the loneliness and strangeness of the place were rather depressing  before i had gone many steps however the sound of running water halted me and just in the nick of time for i was walking straight into a ditch by peering hard into the darkness and feeling my way i found a bridge then it did not take long to reach the light but it was a saloon and not the hotel one peep into it served to make me face about in doublequick time and hurry in the opposite direction  hearing a soft footfall i glanced over my shoulder to see the mexican that i had noticed at the station he was coming from across the street i wondered if he were watching me he might be my heart began to beat violently turning once again i discovered that the fellow could not be seen in the pitchy blackness then i broke into a run     iii the trail  a short dash brought me to the end of the block the side street was not so dark and after i had crossed this open space i glanced backward  soon i sped into a wan circle of light and reaching a door upon which was a hotel sign i burst in chairs were scattered about a bare office a man stirred on a couch and then sat up blinking  im afraidi believe some ones chasing me i said  he sat there eying me and then drawled sleepily  thet aint no call to wake a feller is it  the man settled himself comfortably again and closed his eyes  say isnt this a hotel i want a room i cried  upstairs first door and with that the porter went to sleep in good earnest  i made for the stairs and after a backward look into the street i ran up a smelly lamp shed a yellowish glare along a hall i pushed open the first door and entering the room bolted myself in then all the strength went out of my legs when i sat down on the bed i was in a cold sweat and shaking like a leaf soon the weakness passed and i moved about the room trying to find a lamp or candle evidently the hotel and for that matter the town of holston did not concern itself with such trifles as lights on the instant i got a bad impression of holston i had to undress in the dark when i pulled the window open a little at the top the upper sash slid all the way down i managed to get it back and tried raising the lower sash it was very loose but it stayed up then i crawled into bed  though i was tired and sleepy my mind whirled so that i could not get to sleep if i had been honest with myself i should have wished myself back home pennsylvania seemed a long way off and the adventures that i had dreamed of did not seem so alluring now that i was in a lonely room in a lonely dark town buell had seemed friendly and kindat least in the beginning why had he not answered my call the incident did not look well to me then i fell to wondering if the mexican had really followed me the first thing for me in the morning would be to buy a revolver then if any mexicans  a step on the tin roof outside frightened me stiff i had noticed a porch or shed under my window some one must have climbed upon it i stopped breathing to listen for what seemed moments there was no sound i wanted to think that the noise might have been made by a cat but i couldnt i was scaredfrightened half to death  if there had been a bolt on the window the matter would not have been so disturbing i lay there aquiver eyes upon the gray window space of my room dead silence once more intervened all i heard was the pound of my heart against my ribs  suddenly i froze at the sight of a black figure against the light of my window i recognized the strange bat the grotesque outlines i was about to shout for help when the fellow reached down and softly began to raise the sash  that made me angry jerking up in bed i caught the heavy pitcher from the washstand and flung it with all my might  crash  had i smashed out the whole side of the room it could scarcely have made more noise accompanied by the clinking of glass and the creaking of tin my visitor rolled off the roof i waited expecting an uproar from the other inmates of the hotel no footstep no call sounded within hearing once again the stillness settled down  then to my relief the gray gloom lightened and dawn broke never had i been so glad to see the morning while dressing i cast gratified glances at the ragged hole in the window with the daylight my courage had returned and i began to have a sort of pride in my achievement  if that fellow had known how i can throw a baseball hed have been careful i thought a little cockily  i went downstairs into the office the sleepy porter was mopping the floor behind the desk stood a man so large that he made buell seem small he was all shoulders and beard  can i get breakfast  nobodys got a halfhitch on you has they he replied jerking a monstrous thumb over his shoulder toward a door  i knew the words halfhitch had something to do with a lasso and i was rather taken back by the hotel proprietors remark the diningroom was more attractive than anything i had yet seen about the place the linen was clean and the ham and eggs and coffee that were being served to several rugged men gave forth a savory odor but either the waiter was blind or he could not bear for he paid not the slightest attention to me i waited while trying to figure out the situation something was wrong and whatever it was i guessed that it must be with me after about an hour i got my breakfast then i went into the office intending to be brisk businesslike and careful about asking questions  id like to pay my bill and also for a little damage i said telling what had happened  somebodyll kill thet greaser yet was all the comment the man made  i went outside not knowing whether to be angry or amused with these queer people in the broad light of day holston looked as bad as it had made me feel by night all i could see were the station and freightsheds several stores with high wide signs glaringly painted and a long block of saloons when i had turned a street corner however a number of stores came into view with some threestoried brick buildings and farther out many frame houses  moreover this street led my eye to great snowcapped mountains and i stopped short in my tracks for i realized they were the arizona peaks up the swelling slopes swept a black fringe that i knew to be timber the mountains appeared to be close but i knew that even the footbills were miles away penetier i remembered from one of dicks letters was on the extreme northern slope and it must be anywhere from forty to sixty miles off the sharp white peaks glistened in the morning sun the air had a cool touch of snow and a tang of pine i drew in a full breath with a sense on being among the pines  now i must buy my outfit and take the trail for penetier this i resolved to do with as few questions as possible i never before was troubled by sensitiveness but the fact had dawned upon me that i did not like being taken for a tenderfoot so with this in mind i entered a general merchandise store  it was very large and full of hardware harness saddles blanketseverything that cowboys and ranchmen use several men two in shirtsleeves were chatting near the door they saw me come in and then for all that it meant to them i might as well not have been in existence at all so i sat down to wait determined to take western ways and things as i found them i sat there fifteen minutes by my watch this was not so bad but when a lanky redfaced leatherlegged individual came in too he at once supplied with his wants i began to get angry i waited another five minutes and still the friendly chatting went on finally i could stand it no longer  will somebody wait on me i demanded  one of the shirtsleeved men leisurely got up and surveyed me  do you want to buy something he drawled  yes i do  why didnt you say so  the reply trembling on my lips was cut short by the entrance of buell  hello he said in a loud voice shaking hands with me youve trailed into the right place smith treat this lad right its guns an knives an lassoes he wants ill bet a hoss  yes i want an outfit i said much embarrassed im going to meet a friend out in penetier a rangerdick leslie  buell started violently and his eyes flashed dickdick leslie he said and coughed loudly i know dick so youre a friend of hisn  now let me help you with the outfit  anything strange in buells manner was forgotten in the absorbing interest of my outfit father had given me plenty of money so that i had but to choose i had had sense enough to bring my old corduroys and boots and i had donned them that morning one after another i made my purchaseswinchester revolver bolsters ammunition saddle bridle lasso blanket when i got so far buell said youll need a mustang an a packpony i know a feller whos got jest what you want and with that he led me out of the store  now you take it from me he went on in a fatherly voice holston people havent got any use for easterners an if you mention your businessforestry an thatwhy you wouldnt be safe theres many in the lumberin business here as dont take kindly to the government see thats why im givin you advice keep it to yourself an hit the trail today soon as you can ill steer you right  i was too much excited to answer clearly indeed i hardly thanked him however he scarcely gave me the chance he kept up his talk about the townspeople and their attitude toward easterners until we arrived at a kind of stockyard full of shaggy little ponies the sight of them drove every other thought out of my head  mustangs i exclaimed  sure can you ride  oh yes i have a horse at home what wiry little fellows theyre so wildlooking  you pick out the one as suits you an ill step into clesss here hes the man who owns this bunch  it did not take me long to decide a black mustang at once took my eye when he had been curried and brushed he would be a little beauty i was trying to coax him to me when buell returned with a man  thet your pick he asked as i pointed well now youre not so much of a tenderfoot thets the best mustang in the lot cless how much for him an a packpony an packsaddle  i reckon twenty dollarsll make it square replied the owner  this nearly made me drop with amazement i had only about seventyfive dollars left and i had been very much afraid that i could not buy the mustang let alone the packpony and saddle  cless send round to smith for the lads outfit an saddle up for him at once then he turned to me now some grub an a pan or two  having camped before i knew how to buy supplies buell however cut out much that i wanted saying the thing to think of was a light pack for the pony  ill hurry to the hotel and get my things i said and meet you here ill not be a moment  but buell said it would be better for him to go with me though he did not explain he kept with me still he remained in the office while i went upstairs somehow this suited me for i did not want him to see the broken window i took a few things from my grip and rolled them in a bundle then i took a little leather case of odds and ends i had always carried when camping and slipped it into my pocket hurrying downstairs i left my grip with the porter wrote and mailed a postal card to my father and followed the impatient buell  you see its a smart lick of a ride to penetier and i want to get there before dark he explained kindly  i could have shouted for very glee when i saw the black mustang saddled and bridled  hes well broke said cless keep his bridle down when you aint in the saddle an find a patch of grass fer him at night the ponyll stick to him  cless fell to packing a lean packpony  watch me do this said he youll hev trouble if you dont git the hang of the diamondhitch  i watched him set the little wooden crisscross on the ponys back throw the balance of my outfit which he had tied up in a canvas over the saddle and then pass a long rope in remarkable turns and wonderful loops round pony and pack  whats the mustangs name i inquired  never had any replied the former owner  then its hal i thought how that name would please my brother at home  climb up lets see if you fit the stirrups said cless couldnt be better  now young feller you can hit the trail put in buell with his big voice an remember what i told you this country aint got much use for a feller as cant look out for himself  he opened the gate and led my mustang into the road and quite some distance the pony jogged along after us then buell stopped with a finger outstretched  there at the end of this street youll find a trail hit it an stick to it all the little trails leadin into it neednt bother you  he swept his hand round to the west of the mountain the direction did not tally with the idea i had gotten from dicks letter  i thought penetier was on the north side of the mountains  who said so he asked staring dont i know this country take it from me  i thanked him and turning with a light heart i faced the black mountain and my journey  it was about ten oclock when hal jogged into a broad trail on the outskirts of holston a gray flat lay before me on the other side of which began the slow rise of the slope i could hardly contain myself i wanted to run the mustang but did not for the sake of the burdened pony that sageflat was miles wide though it seemed so narrow the back of the lower slope began to change to a dark green which told me i was surely getting closer to the mountains even if it did not seem so the trail began to rise and at last i reached the first pinetrees they were a disappointment to me being no larger than many of the white oaks at home and stunted with ragged dead tops they proved to me that trees isolated from their fellows fare as poorly as trees overcrowded where pines grow closely but not too closely they rise straight and true cleaning themselves of the low branches and making good lumber free of knots where they grow far apart at the mercy of wind and heat and free to spread many branches they make only gnarled and knotty lumber  as i rode on the pines became slowly more numerous and loftier then when i had surmounted what i took to be the first foothill i came upon a magnificent forest a little farther on the trail walled me in with great seamed trunks six feet in diameter rising a hundred feet before spreading a single branch  meanwhile my mustang kept steadily up the slowrising trail and the time passed either the grand old forest had completely bewitched me or the sweet smell of pine had intoxicated me for as i rode along utterly content i entirely forgot about dick and the trail and where i was heading nor did i come to my senses until hal snorted and stopped before a tangled windfall  then i glanced down to see only the clean brown pineneedles there was no trail perplexed and somewhat anxious i rode back a piece expecting surely to cross the trail but i did not i went to the left and to the right then circled in a wide curve no trail the forest about me seemed at once familiar and strange  it was only when the long shadows began to creep under the trees that i awoke fully to the truth  i had missed the trail i was lost in the forest     iv lost in the forest  for a moment i was dazed and then came panic i ran up this ridge and that one i rushed to and fro over ground which looked whatever way i turned exactly the same and i kept saying im lost im lost not until i dropped exhausted against a pinetree did any other thought come to me  the moment that i stopped running about so aimlessly the panicky feeling left me i remembered that for a ranger to be lost in the forest was an everyday affair and the sooner i began that part of my education the better then it came to me how foolish i had been to get alarmed when i knew that the general slope of the forest led down to the open country  this put an entirely different light upon the matter i still had some fears that i might not soon find dick leslie but these i dismissed for the present at least a suitable place to camp for the night must be found i led the mustang down into the hollows keeping my eye sharp for grass presently i came to a place that was wet and soggy at the bottom and following this up for quite a way i found plenty of grass and a pool of clear water  often as i had made camp back in the woods of pennsylvania the doing of it now was new for this was not play it was the real thing and it made the old camping seem tame i took the saddle off hal and tied him with my lasso making as long a halter as possible slipping the pack from the pony was an easier task than the getting it back again was likely to prove next i broke open a box of cartridges and loaded the winchester my revolver was already loaded and hung on my belt remembering dicks letters about the bears and mountainlions in penetier forest i got a good deal of comfort out of my weapons then i built a fire and while my supper was cooking i scraped up a mass of pineneedles for a bed never had i sat down to a meal with such a sense of strange enjoyment  but when i had finished and had everything packed away and covered my mind began to wander in unexpected directions why was it that the twilight seemed to move under the giant pines and creep down the hollow while i gazed the gray shadows deepened to black and night came suddenly my campfire seemed to give almost no light yet close at hand the flickering gleams played hideandseek among the pines and chased up the straight tree trunks the crackling of my fire and the light steps of the grazing mustangs only emphasized the silence of the forest then a low moaning from a distance gave me a chill at first i had no idea what it was but presently i thought it must be the wind in the pines it bore no resemblance to any sound i had ever before heard in the woods it would murmur from different parts of the forest sometimes it would cease for a little and then travel and swell toward me only to die away again but it rose steadily with shorter intervals of silence until the intermittent gusts swept through the treetops with a rushing roar i had listened to the crash of the ocean surf and the resemblance was a striking one  listening to this mournful wind with all my ears i was the better prepared for any lonesome cries of the forest nevertheless a sudden sharp kiyii seemingly right at my back gave me a fright that sent my tongue to the roof of my mouth  fumbling at the hammer of my rifle i peered into the blackstreaked gloom of the forest the crackling of dry twigs brought me to my feet at the same moment the mustangs snorted something was prowling about just beyond the light i thought of a panther that was the only beast i could think of which had such an unearthly cry  then another bowl resembling that of a dog and followed by yelps and barks told me that i was being visited by a pack of coyotes i spent the good part of an hour listening to their serenade the wild mournful notes sent quivers up my back byandby they went away and as my fire had burned down to a red glow and the night wind had grown cold i began to think of sleep  but i was not sleepy when i had stretched out on the soft bed of pineneedles with my rifle close by and was all snug and warm under the heavy blanket it seemed that nothing was so far away from me as sleep the wonder of my situation kept me wide awake my eyes on the dim huge pines and the glimmer of stars and my ears open to the rush and roar of the wind every sense alert hours must have passed as i lay there living over the things that had happened and trying to think out what was to come at last however i rolled over on my side and with my hand on the rifle and my cheek close to the sweetsmelling pineneedles i dropped asleep  when i awoke the forest was bright and sunny  youll make a fine forester i said aloud in disgust at my tardiness then began the stern business of the day while getting breakfast i turned over in my mind the proper thing for me to do evidently i must pack and find the trail the pony had wandered off into the woods but was easily caughta fact which lightened my worry for i knew how dependent i was upon my mustangs when i had tried for i do not know how long to get my pack to stay on the ponys back i saw where mr cless had played a joke on me all memory of the diamondhitch had faded into utter confusion first the pack fell over the offside next on top of me then the saddle slipped awry and when i did get the pack to remain stationary upon the patient pony how on earth to tie it there became more and more of a mystery finally in sheer desperation i ran round the pony pulled tugged and knotted the lasso more by luck than through sense i had accomplished something in the nature of the diamondhitch  i headed hal up the gentle forest slope and began the days journey wherever chance might lead me as confidence came my enjoyment increased i began to believe i could take care of myself i reasoned out that as the peaks were snowcapped i should find water and very likely game up higher moreover i might climb a foothill or bluff from which i could get my bearings  it seemed to me that i passed more pinetrees than i could have imagined there were in the whole world miles and miles of pines and in every mile they grew larger and ruggeder and farther apart and so high that i could hardly see the tips after a time i got out of the almost level forest into ground ridged and hollowed and found it advisable to turn more to the right on the sunny southern slopes i saw trees that dwarfed the ones on the colder and shady north sides i also found many small pines and seedlings growing in warm protected places this showed me the value of the sun to a forest though i kept a lookout for deer or game of any kind i saw nothing except some black squirrels with white tails they were beautiful and very tame and one was nibbling at what i concluded must have been a seed from a pinecone  presently i fancied that i espied a moving speck far down through the forest glades i stopped hal and watching closely soon made certain of it then it became lost for a time but reappeared again somewhat closer it was like a brown blur and scarcely moved i reined hal more to the right not for quite a while did i see the thing again and when i did it looked so big and brown that i took up my winchester then it disappeared once more  i descended into a hollow and tying hal i stole forward on foot hoping by that means to get close to the strange object without being seen myself  i waited behind a pine and suddenly three horsemen rode across a glade not two hundred yards away the foremost rider was no other than the mexican whom i had reason to remember  the huge trunk amply concealed me but nevertheless i crouched down how strange that i should run into that mexican again where was he going had he followed me was there a trail  as long as the three men were in sight i watched them when the last brown speck had flitted and disappeared far away in the forest i retraced my steps to my mustang pondering upon this new turn in my affairs  things are bound to happen to me i concluded and i may as well make up my mind to that  while standing beside hal undecided as to my next move i heard a whistle it was faint perhaps miles away yet unmistakably it was the whistle of an engine i wondered if the railroad turned round this side of the peaks mounting hal i rode down the forest to the point where i had seen the men and there came upon a trail i proceeded along this in the direction the men had taken i had come again to the slowrising level that i had noted earlier in my mornings journey after several miles a light or opening in the forest ahead caused me to use more caution as i rode forward i saw a vast area of treetops far below and then i found myself on the edge of a foothill  right under me was a wide yellow bare spot miles across a horrible slash in the green forest and in the middle of it surrounded by stacks on stacks of lumber was a great sawmill  i stared in utter amazement a sawmill on penetier even as i gazed a train of freshcut lumber trailed away into the forest     v the sawmill  in my surprise i almost forgot the mexican then i thought that if dick were there the mexican would be likely to have troubles of his own i remembered dicks reputation as a fighter but suppose i did not find dick at the sawmill this part of the forest was probably owned by private individuals for i couldnt imagine government timber being cut in this fashion so i tied hal and the pony amidst a thick clump of young pines and leaving all my outfit except my revolver i struck out across the slash  no second glance was needed to tell that the lumbering here was careless and without thought for the future it had been a clean cut and what small saplings had escaped the saw had been crushed by the dropping and hauling of the large pines the stumps were all about three feet high and that meant the waste of many thousands of feet of good lumber only the straight unbranched trunks had been used the tops of the pines had not been lopped and lay where they had fallen it was a wilderness of yellow brush a dry jungle the smell of pine was so powerful that i could hardly breathe fire must inevitably complete this work of ruin already i was forester enough to see that  presently the trail crossed a railroad track which appeared to have been hastily constructed swinging along at a rapid step on the ties i soon reached the outskirts of the huge stacks of lumber i must have walked half a mile between two yellow walls then i entered the lumber camp  it was even worselooking than the slash rows of dirty tents lines of squatty logcabins and many flatboard houses clustered around an immense sawmill evidently i had arrived at the noon hour for the mill was not running and many rough men were lounging about smoking pipes at the door of the first shack stood a fat roundfaced negro wearing a long dirty apron  is dick leslie here i asked  i dunno if dicks come in yet but i specks him he replied be you the young gent dicks lookin fer from down east  yes  come right in sonny come right in an eat dick allus eats with me an he has spoke often bout you he led me in and seated me at a bench where several men were eating they were brawny fellows clad in overalls and undershirts and one who spoke pleasantly to me had sawdust on his bare arms and even in his hair the cook set before me a bowl of soup a plate of beans potroast and coffee all of which i attacked with a good appetite presently the men finished their meat and went outside leaving me alone with the cook  many men on this job i asked  moren a thousand buells runnin two shifts day an night  buell does he own this land  no hes only the agent of a frisco lumber company an the land belongs to the government buells sure slashin the lumber off though two freighttrains of lumber out every day  is this penetier forest i queried carelessly but i had begun to think hard  sure  i wanted to ask questions but thought it wiser to wait i knew enough already to make out that i had come upon the scene of a gigantic lumber steal buells strange manner on the train at the station and his eagerness to hurry me out of holston now needed no more explanation i began to think the worst of him  did you see a mexican come into camp i inquired of the negro  sure greaser got here this mornin  he tried to rob me in holston  taint nothin new fer greaser hes a thief but i never heerd of him holdin anybody up no nerve cept to knife a feller in the back  whatll i do if i meet him here  slam him one youre a strappin big lad slam him one an flash your gun on him greasers a coward i seen a young feller hed cheated make him crawl anyway itll be all day with him when dick finds out he tried to rob you an say stranger if a feller stays sober this camps safe enough in daytime but at night drunk or sober its a tough place  before i had finished eating a shrill whistle from the sawmill called the hands to work soon it was followed by the rumble of machinery and the sharp singing of a saw  i set out to see the lumbercamp and although i stepped forth boldly the truth was that with all my love for the wild west i would have liked to be at home but here i was and i determined not to show the white feather  i passed a row of cookshacks like the one i had been in and several stores and saloons the lumbercamp was a little town a rambling log cabin attracted me by reason of the shaggy mustangs standing before it and the sounds of mirth within a peep showed me a room with a long bar where men and boys were drinking i heard the rattle of dice and the clink of silver seeing the place was crowded i thought i might find dick there so i stepped inside my entrance was unnoticed so far as i could tell in fact there seemed no reason why it should be otherwise for being roughly dressed i did not look very different from the many young fellows there i scanned all the faces but did not see dicks nor for that matter the mexicans both disappointed and relieved i turned away for the picture of low dissipation was not attractive  the hum of the great sawmill drew me like a magnet i went out to the lumberyard at the back of the mill where a trestle slanted down to a pond full of logs a train loaded with pines had just pulled in and dozens of men were rolling logs off the flatcars into a canal at stations along the canal stood others pikepoling the logs toward the trestle where an endless chain caught them with sharp claws and hauled them up halfway from the ground they were washed clean by a circle of waterspouts  i walked up the trestle and into the mill the noise almost deafened me high above all other sounds rose the piercing song of the saw and the short intervals when it was not cutting were filled with a thunderous crash that jarred the whole building after a few confused glances i got the working order into my head and found myself in the most interesting place i had ever seen  as the stream of logs came up into the mill the first log was shunted off the chain upon a carriage two men operated this carriage by levers one to take the log up to the saw and the other to run it back for another cut the run back was very swift then a huge black iron head butted up from below and turned the log over as easily as if it had been a straw this was what made the jar and crash on the first cut the long strip of bark went to the left and up against five little circular saws then the five pieces slipped out of sight down chutes when the log was trimmed a man stationed near the huge bandsaw made signs to those on the carriage and i saw that they got from him directions whether to cut the log into timbers planks or boards the heavy timbers after leaving the saw went straight down the middle of the mill the planks went to the right the boards in another direction men and boys were everywhere each with a lever in hand there was not the slightest cessation of the work and a log forty feet long and six feet thick which had taken hundreds of years to grow was cut up in just four minutes  the place fascinated me i had not dreamed that a sawmill could be brought to such a pitch of mechanical perfection and i wondered how long the timber would last at that rate of cutting the movement and din tired me and i went outside upon a long platform here workmen caught the planks and boards as they came out and loaded them upon trucks which were wheeled away this platform was a world in itself it sent arms everywhere among the piles of lumber and once or twice i was as much lost as i had been up in the forest  while turning into one of these byways i came suddenly upon buell and another man they were standing near a little house of weatherstrips evidently an office and were in their shirtsleeves they had not seen or heard me i dodged behind a pile of planks intending to slip back the way i had come before i could move buells voice rooted me to the spot  his names ward tall wellset lad i put greaser after him the other night hopin to scare him back east but nix  well hes here nowto study forestry ha ha said the other  youre sure the boy you mean is the one i mean  greaser told me so and this boy is leslies friend  thats the worst of it replied buell impatiently ive got leslie fixed as far as this lumber deal is concerned but he wont stand for any more he was harder to fix than the other rangers an im afraid of him hes grouchy now  you shouldnt have let the boy get here  stockton i tried to prevent it i put greaser with bud an bill on his trail they didnt find him an now here he turns up  maybe he can be fixed  not if i know my business he cant take that from me this kid is straight hell queer my deal in a minute if he gets wise mind you im gettin leary of washington weve seen about the last of these lumber deals if i can pull this one off ill quit all i want is a little more time then ill fire the slash an thatll cover tracks  buell i wouldnt want to be near penetier when you light that fire this forest will burn like tinder  its a whole lot i care then let her burn let the government put out the fire now whats to be done about this boy  i think id try to feel him out maybe he can be fixed boys who want to be foresters cant be rich failing thatyou say hes a kid who wants to hunt and shootget some one to take him up on the mountain  see here stockton this young ward will see the timber is bein cut clean if it was only a little patch i wouldnt mind but this slash an this mill hell know moren that hell tell leslie about the mexican dicks no fool were up against it  its risky buell you remember the ranger up in oregon  then we are to fall down on this deal all because of a fresh tenderfoot kid demanded buell  not so loud well not fall down but cautionuse caution you made a mistake in trusting so much to the greaser  i know an im afraid of leslie an that other fireranger jim williams hes a texan an a bad man the two of them could about trim up this camp theyll both fight for the boy take that from me  we are sure up against it think now and think quick  first ill try to fix the boy if that wont work well kidnap him then well take no chances with leslie theres a cool two hundred an fifty thousand in this deal for us an were goin to get it  with that buell went into his office and closed the door the other man stockton walked briskly down the platform i could not resist peeping from my hidingplace as he passed he was tall and had a red beard which would enable me to recognize him if we met  i waited there for some little time then i saw that by squeezing between two plies of lumber could reach the other side of the platform when i reached the railing i climbed over and with the help of braces and posts soon got to where i could drop down once on the ground i ran along under the platform until i saw a lane that led to the street my one thought was to reach the cabin where the negro cook stayed and ask him if dick leslie had come to camp if he had not arrived then i intended to make a beeline for my mustang     vi dick leslie ranger  which end of the street i entered i had no idea the cabins were all alike and in my hurry i would have passed the cooks shack had it not been for the sight of a man standing in the door that stalwart figure i would have known anywhere  dick i cried rushing at him  what dicks welcome was i did not hear but judging from the grip he put on my shoulders and then on my hands he was glad to see me  ken blessed if id have known you he said shoving me back at armslength lets have a look at you grown i say but youre a husky lad  while he was looking at me i returned the scrutiny with interest dick had always been big but now he seemed wider and heavier among these bronzed westerners he appeared pale but that was only on account of his fair skin  ken didnt you get my letterthe one telling you not to come west yet a while  no i replied blankly the last one i got was in mayabout the middle i have it with me you certainly asked me to come then dick dont you want menow  plain it was that my friend felt uncomfortable he shifted from one foot to another and a cloud darkened his brow but his blue eyes burned with a warm light as he put his hand on my shoulder  ken im glad to see you he said earnestly its like getting a glimpse of home but i wrote you not to come conditions have changedtheres something doing hereill  you neednt explain dick i replied gravely i know buell and i waved my hand from the sawmill to the encircling slash  dicks face turned a fiery red i believed that was the only time dick leslie ever failed to look a fellow in the eye  ken youre on he said recovering his composure well wait till you hearhello heres jim williams my pardner  a clinking of spurs accompanied a soft step  jim heres ken ward the kid pardner i used to have back in the states said dick ken you know jim  if ever i knew anything by heart it was what dick had written me about this texan jim williams  ken i shore am glad to see you drawled jim giving my hand a squeeze that i thought must break every bone in it  though jim williams had never been described to me my first sight of him fitted my own ideas he was tall and spare his weatherbeaten face seemed set like a dark mask only his eyes moved and they had a quivering alertness and a brilliancy that made them hard to look into he wore a wide sombrero a blue flannel shirt with a double row of big buttons overalls topboots with very high heels and long spurs a heavy revolver swung at his hip and if i had not already known that jim williams had fought indians and killed bad men i should still have seen something that awed me in the look of him  i certainly felt proud to be standing with those two rangers and for the moment buell and all his crew could not have daunted me  hello whats this inquired dick throwing back my coat and catching sight of my revolver he ejaculated ken ward  wal ken if youall aint packin a gun said jim in his slow careless drawl dick he shore is  it was now my turn to blush  yes ive got a gun i replied and i ought to have had it the other night  how so inquired dick quickly  it did not take me long to relate the incident of the mexican  dick looked like a thundercloud but jim swayed and shook with laughter  you knocked him off the roof wal thet shore is deelightful it shore is  yes and dick i went on breathlessly the greaser followed me and if i hadnt missed the trail i dont know what would have happened anyway he got here first  the greaser trailed you interrupted dick sharply  when i replied he glanced keenly at me how do you know  i suspected it when i saw him with two men in the forest but now i know it  how  i beard buell tell stockton he had put the greaser on my trail  buellstockton exclaimed dick whatd they have to do with the greaser  i met buell on the train i told him i had come west to study forestry buells afraid ill find out about this lumber steal and he wants to shut my mouth  dick looked from me to jim and jim slowly straitened his tall form for a moment neither spoke dicks white face caused me to look away from him jim put a hand on my arm  ken you shore was lucky you shore was  i guess he doesnt know how lucky added dick somewhat huskily come on well look up the mexican  it shore is funny how bad i want to see thet greaser  dicks hard look and tone were threatening enough yet they did not affect me so much as the easy gay manner of the texan little cold quivers ran over me and my knees knocked together for the moment my animosity toward the mexican vanished and with it the old hunger to be in the thick of wild western life i was afraid that i was going to see a man killed without being able to lift a hand to prevent it  the rangers marched me between them down the street and into the corner saloon dick held me half behind him with his left hand while jim sauntered ahead strangest of all the things that had happened was the sudden silencing of the noisy crowd  the mexican was not there his companions bud and bill as buell had called them were sitting at a table and as jim williams walked into the center of the room they slowly and gradually rose to their feet one was a swarthy man with evil eyes and a scar on his cheek the other had a brickred face and a sandy mustache with a vicious curl neither seemed to be afraid only cautious  were all lookin for thet greaser friend of yourn drawled jim i shore want to see him bad  hes gone williams replied one was in somethin of a rustle an didnt leave no word  wal i reckon hes all were lookin for this pertickler minnit  jim spoke in a soft drawling voice and his almost expressionless tone seemed to indicate pleasant indifference still no one could have been misled by it for the long steady gaze he gave the men and his cool presence that held the room quiet meant something vastly different no reply was offered bud and bill sat down evidently to resume their cardplaying the uneasy silence broke to a laugh then to subdued voices and finally the clatter and hum began again dick led me outside where we were soon joined by jim  hes holed up suggested dick  shore i dont take no stock in his hittin the trail hes layin low  lets look around a bit anyhow  dick took me back to the cooks cabin and bidding me remain inside strode away i beard footsteps so soon after his departure that i made certain he had returned but the burly form which blocked the light in the cabin door was not dicks i was astounded to recognize buell  hello he said in his blustering voice heard you had reached camp an have been huntin you up  i greeted him pleasantly enoughmore from surprise than from a desire to mislead him it seemed to me then that a child could have read buell hed an air of suppressed excitement there was a glow on his face and a kind of daring flash in his eyes he seemed too eager too glad to see me  ive got a good job for you he went on glibly jest what you want an youre jest what i need come into my office an help me therell be plenty of outside workmeasurin lumber markin trees an such  why mr buelliyou see dickhe might not  i hesitated not knowing how to proceed but at my halting speech buell became even more smiling and voluble  dick oh dick an i stand all right take thet from me dickll agree to what i want i need a young feller bad moneys no object youre a bright youngster youll look out for my interests here he pulled out a large wad of greenbacks and then spoke in a lower voice you understand that money cuts no ice round this camp weve a big deal we need a smart young feller theres always some little irregularities about these big timber deals out west but youll wear blinkers an make some money while youre studyin forestry see  irregularities what kind of irregularities  for the life of me i could not keep a little scorn out of my question buell slowly put the bills in his pocket while his eyes searched i could not control my rising temper  you mean you want to fix me  he made no answer and his face stiffened  you mean you want to buy my silence shut my mouth about this lumber steal  he drew in his breath audibly yet still he did not speak either he was dull of comprehension or else he was astonished beyond words i knew i was mad to goad him like that but i could not help it i grew hot with anger and the more clearly i realized that he had believed he could fix me with his dirty money the hotter i got  you told stockton you were leary of washington and were afraid id queer your big deal well mr buell thats exactly what im going to doqueer it  he went black in the face and cursing horribly grasped me by the arm i struggled but i could not loose that iron hand suddenly i felt a violent wrench that freed me then i saw dick swing back his shoulder and shoot out his arm he knocked buell clear across the room and when the man fell i thought the cabin was coming down in the crash he appeared stunned for he groped about with his hands found a chair and using it as a support rose to his feet swaying unsteadily  leslie ill get you for thistake it from me he muttered  dicks lips were tight and he watched buell with flaming eyes the lumberman lurched out of the door and we heard him cursing after he had disappeared then dick looked at me with no little disapproval  what did you say to make buell wild like that  i told dick word for word first he looked dumfounded then angry and he ended up with a grim laugh  ken youre sure bent on starting something as jim would say youve started it all right and jimll love you for it but im responsible to your mother ken i remember your motherand youre going back home  dick  youre going back home as fast as i can get you to holston and put you on a train thats all  i wont go i cried  without any more words dick led me down the street to a rude corral here he rapidly saddled and packed his horses the only time he spoke was when he asked me where i had tied my mustangs soon we were hurrying out through the slash toward the forest dicks troubled face kept down my resentment but my heart grew like lead what an ending to my longcherished trip to the west it had lasted two days the disappointment seemed more than i could bear  we found the mustangs as i had left them and the sight of hal and the feeling of the saddle made me all the worse we did not climb the foothill by the trail which the mexican had used but took a long slow ascent far round to the left dick glanced back often and when we reached the top he looked again in a way to convince me that he had some apprehensions of being followed  twilight of that eventful day found us pitching camp in a thickly timbered hollow i could not help dwelling on how different my feelings would have been if this night were but the beginning of many nights with dick it was the last and the more i thought about it the more wretched i grew dick rolled in his blanket without saying even goodnight and i lay there watching the veils and shadows of firelight flicker on the pines and listening to the wind gradually the bitterness seemed to go away my body relaxed and sank into the soft fragrant pineneedles the great shadowy trees mixed with the surrounding darkness when i awoke it was broad daylight and dick was shaking my arm  hunt up the horses while i get the grub ready he said curtly  as the hollow was carpeted with thick grass our horses had not strayed i noticed that here the larger trees had been cut and the forest resembled a fine park in the sunny patches seedlings were sprouting many little bushy pines were growing and the saplings had sufficient room and light to prosper i commented to dick upon the difference between this part of penetier and the hideous slash we had left  there were a couple of government markers went through here and marked the timber to be cut said dick  was the timber cut in the mill i saw  no buells just run up that mill the old one is out here a ways nearer holston  is it possible dick that any of those loggers back there dont know the government is being defrauded  ken hardly any of them know it and they wouldnt care if they did you see this forestpreserve business is new out here formerly the lumbermen bought so much land and cut over itskinned it two years ago when the national forests were laid out the lumbering menthat is the loggers sawmill hands and so onfound they did not get as much employment as formerly so generally theyre sore on the national forest idea  but dick if they understand the idea of forestry theyd never oppose it  maybe i dont understand it too well myself i can fight firethats my business but this ranger work is new i doubt if the westerners will take to forestry thereve been some shady deals all over the west because of it buell now hes a timber shark he bought so much timber from the government and had the markers come in to mark the cut then after they were gone he rushed up a mill and clapped on a thousand hands  and the rangers stand for it wherell their jobs be when the government finds out  i was against it from the start so was jim particularly but the other rangers persuaded us  it began to dawn upon me that dick leslie might after all turn out to be good soil in which to plant some seeds of forestry i said no more then as we were busy packing for the start but when we had mounted i began to talk i told him all i had learned about trees how i loved them and how i had determined to devote my life to their study care and development as we rode along under the widespreading pines i illustrated my remarks by every example i could possibly use the more i talked the more interested dick became and this spurred me on perhaps i exaggerated but my conscience never pricked me he began to ask questions  we reached a spring at midday and halted for a rest i kept on pleading and presently i discovered to my joy that i had made a strong impression upon dick it seemed a strange thing for me to be trying to explain forestry to a forest ranger but so it was  ken its all news to me ive been on penetier about a year and i never heard a word of what youve been telling me my duties have been the practical ones that any woodsman knows jim and the other rangerswhy they dont know any more than i its a great thing and ive queered my chance with the government  no you haventneither has jimnot if youll be straight from now on you cant keep faith with buell he tried to kidnap me that lets you out well spoil buells little deal and save penetier a letter to father will do it he has friends in the forestry department at washington dick what do you say its not too late  the dark shade lifted from the rangers face and he looked at me with the smile of the old fishing days  say i say yes he exclaimed in ringing voice ken youve made a man of me     vi back to holston  soon we were out of the forest and riding across the sageflat with holston in sight both of us avoided the unpleasant subject of my enforced homegoing evidently dick felt cut up about it and it caused me such a pang that i drove it from my mind toward the end of our ride dick began again to talk of forestry  ken its mighty interestingall this youve said about trees some of the things are so simple that i wonder i didnt hit on them long ago in fact i knew a lot of what you might call forestry but the scientific ideasthey stump me now what you said about a pinetree cleaning itselfcome back at me with that  why thats simple enough dick i answered now say here we have a clump of pine saplings they stand pretty closeclose enough to make dense shade but not too crowded the shade has prevented the lower branches from producing leaves as a consequence these branches die then they dry rot and fall off so when the trees mature they are cleanshafted they have fine clear trunks they have cleaned themselves and so make the best of lumber free from knots  so our talk went on once in town i was impatient to write to my father for we had decided that we would not telegraph leaving our horses in clesss corral we went to the hotel and proceeded to compose the letter this turned out more of a task than we had bargained for but we got it finished at last not forgetting to put in a word for jim williams and then we both signed it  there i cried dick something will be doing round holston before many days  thats no joke you can bet replied dick wiping his face ken its made me sweat just to see that letter start east buell is a tough sort and hell make trouble well he wants to steer clear of jim and me  after that we fell silent and walked slowly back toward clesss corral dicks lips were closed tight and he did not look at me evidently he did not intend to actually put me aboard a train and the time for parting had come he watered his horses at the trough and fussed over his pack and fumbled with his saddlegirths it looked to me as though he had not the courage to say goodby  ken it didnt look so badso mean till now he said im all broken up to get you way out here oh whats the use im mighty sorry goodbyemaybe  he broke off suddenly and wringing my hand he vaulted into the saddle he growled at his packpony and drove him out of the corral then he set off at a steady trot down the street toward the open country  it came to me in a flash as i saw him riding farther and farther away that the reason my heart was not broken was because i did not intend to go home dick had taken it for granted that i would board the next train for the east but i was not going to do anything of the sort to my amaze i found my mind made up on that score i had no definite plan but i was determined to endure almost anything rather than give up my mustang and outfit  its shift for myself now i thought soberly i guess i can make good  im going back to penetier  even in the moment of impulse i knew how foolish this would be but i could not help it that forest had bewitched me i meant to go back to it  ill stay away from the sawmill i meditated growing lighter of heart every minute ill keep out of sight of the lumbermen ill go higher up on the mountain and hunt and study the trees ill do it  whereupon i marched off at once to a store and bought the supply of provisions that buell had decided against when he helped me with my outfit this addition made packing the pony more of a problem than ever but i contrived to get it all on to my satisfaction it was nearing sunset when i rode out of holston this second time the sage flat was bare and gray dick had long since reached the pines and would probably make camp at the spring where we had stopped for lunch i certainly did not want to catch up with him but as there was small chance of that it caused me no concern  shortly after sunset twilight fell and it was night when i reached the first pinetrees still as the trail was easily to be seen i kept on for i did not want to camp without water the forest was very dark in some places like a huge black tent and i had not ridden far when the old fear of night the fancy of things out there in the darkness once more possessed me it made me angry why could i not have the same confidence that i had in the daytime it was impossible the forest was full of moving shadows when the wind came up to roar in the pinetips it was a relief because it broke the silence  i began to doubt whether i could be sure of locating the spring and i finally decided to make camp at once i stopped hal and had swung my leg over the pommel when i saw a faint glimmer of light far ahead it twinkled like a star but was not white and cold enough for a star  thats dicks campfire i said ill have to stop here maybe im too close now  i pondered the question the blaze was a long way off and i concluded i could risk camping on the spot provided i did not make a fire accordingly i dismounted and was searching for a suitable place when i happened to think that the campfire might not be dicks after all perhaps buell had sent the mexican with bud and bill on my trail again this would not do but i did not want to go back or turn off the trail  ill slip up and see who it is i decided  the idea pleased me however i did not yield to it without further consideration i had a clear sense of responsibility i knew that from now on i should be called upon to reason out many perplexing things i did not want to make any mistakes so i tied hal and the packpony to a bush fringing the trail and set off through the forest  it dawned upon me presently that the campfire was much farther away than it appeared often it went out of sight behind trees by degrees it grew larger and larger then i slowed down and approached more cautiously once when the trees obscured it i traveled some distance without getting a good view of it passing down into a little hollow i lost it again when i climbed out i hauled up short with a sharp catch of my breath there were several figures moving around the campfire i had stumbled on a camp that surely was not dick leslies  the ground was as soft as velvet and my footsteps gave forth no sound when the wind lulled i paused behind a tree and waited for another gusty roar i kept very close to the trail for that was the only means by which i could return to my horses i felt the skin tighten on my face suddenly as i paused i beard angry voices pitched high but i could not make out the words  curiosity got the better of me if the men were hired by buell i wanted to know what they were quarrelling about i stole stealthily from tree to tree and another hollow opened beneath me it was so wide and the pines so overshadowed it that i could not tell how close the opposite side might be to the campfire i slipped down along the edge of the trail the blaze disappeared only a faint arc of light showed through the gloom  i peered keenly into the blackness at length i reached the slope here i dropped to my hands and knees  it was a long crawl to the top reaching it i cautiously peeped over there were trees hiding the fire but it was close i heard the voices of men i backed down the slope crossed the trail and came up on the other side pines grew thick on this level and i stole silently from one to another finally i reached the black trunk of a tree close to the campfire  for a moment i lay low i did not seem exactly afraid but i was all tense and hard and my heart drummed in my ears there was something ticklish about this scouting then i peeped out  it added little to my excitement to recognize the mexican he sat near the fire smoking a cigarette near him were several men one of whom was bill facing them sat a man with his back to a small sapling he was tied with a lasso  one glance at his white face made me drop behind the tree where i lay stunned and bewilderedfor that man was dick leslie     viii the lumbermen  for a full moment i just lay still hugging the ground and i did not seem to think at all voices loud in anger roused me raising myself i guardedly looked from behind the tree  one of the lumbermen threw brush on the fire making it blaze brightly he was tall and had a red beard i recognized stockton buells right hand in the lumber deal  leslie youre a liar he said  dicks eyes glinted from his pale face  yes thats your speed stockton he retorted you bring your thugs into my camp pretending to be friendly you grab a fellow behind his back tie him up and then call him a liar wait you timber shark  youre lying about that kid ward declared the other you sent him back east thats what hell have the whole forest service down here buell will be wild oh he wont do a thing when he learns ward has given us the slip  i tell you ken ward gave me the slip replied dick ill admit i meant to see him safe in holston but he wouldnt go he ran off from me right here in this forest  what could have been dicks object in telling such a lie it made me wonder perhaps these lumbermen were more dangerous than i had supposed and dick did not wish them to believe i had left penetier maybe he was playing for time and did not want them to get alarmed and escape before the officers came  why did he run off asked stockton  because i meant to send him home and he didnt want to go hes crazy to camp out to hunt and ride  if thats true leslie theres been no word sent to washington  how could there be  well ive got to hold you anyway till we see buell his orders were to keep you and ward prisoners till this lumber deal is pulled off were not going to be stopped now  leslie turned crimson and strained on the lasso that bound him to the sapling somebody is going to pay for this business he declared savagely you forget im an officer in this forest  ill hold you leslie whatever comes of it answered the lumberman id advise you to cool down  you and buell have barked up the wrong tree mind that stockton jim williams my pardner is wise he expects me back tomorrow  see hyar stockton put in bill youre new in arizona an i want to give you a hunch if jim williams hits this trail you aint goin to be well enough to care about any old lumber steal  jim hit the trail all right went on dick hes after greaser itd go hard with you if jim happened to walk in now  i dont want to buck against williams thats certain replied stockton i know his record but ill take a chanceanyway till buell knows its his game  dick made no answer and sat there eyeing his captors there was little talk after this bud threw a log on the fire stockton told the mexican to take a look at the horses greaser walked within twenty feet of where i lay and i held my breath while he passed the others rolled in their blankets it was now so dark that i could not distinguish anything outside of the campfire circle but i heard greasers soft shuffling footsteps as he returned then his dark slim figure made a shadow between me and the light he sat down before the fire and began to roll a cigarette he did not seem sleepy  a daring scheme flashed into my mind i would crawl into camp and free dick not only would i outwit the lumber thieves but also make dick think well of me what would jim williams say of a trick like that the thought of the texan banished what little hesitation i felt glancing round the bright circle i made my plan it was to crawl far back into the darkness go around to the other side of the camp and then slip up behind dick already his head was nodding on his breast it made me furious to see him sitting so uncomfortably sagging in the lasso  i tried to beat down my excitement but there was a tingling all over me that would not subside but i soon saw that i might have a long wait the mexican did not go to sleep so i had time to cool off  the campfire gradually burned out and the white glow changed to red one of the men snored in a way that sounded like a wheezy whistle coyotes howled in the woods and the longer i listened to the long strange howls the better i liked them the roar in the wind had died down to a moaning i thought of myself lying there with my skin prickling and my eyes sharp on the darkening forms i thought of the nights i had spent with hal in the old woods at home how full the present seemed my breast swelled my hand gripped my revolver my eyes pierced the darkness and i would not have been anywhere else for the world  greaser smoked out his cigarette and began to nod that was the signal for me i crawled noiselessly from the tree when i found myself going down into the hollow i stopped and rose to my feet the forest was so pitchy black that i could not tell the trees from the darkness i groped to the left trying to circle once i snapped a twig it cracked like a pistolshot and my heart stopped beating then began to thump but greaser never stirred as he sat in the waning light at last i had half circled the camp  after a short rest i started forward slow and stealthy as a creeping cat when within fifty feet of the fire i went down on allfours and began to crawl twice i got out of line but at last dicks burly shoulders loomed up between me and the light  then i halted my breast seemed bursting and i panted so hard that i was in a terror lest i should awaken some one again i thought of what i was doing and fought desperately to gain my coolness  now the only cover i had was dicks broad back for the sapling to which he was tied was small i drew my huntingknife one more wriggle brought me close to dick with my face near his hands which were bound behind him i slipped the blade under the lasso and cut it through  dick started as if he had received an electric shock he threw back his head and uttered a sudden exclamation  although i was almost paralyzed with fright i put my hand on his shoulder and whispered sssh its ken  greaser uttered a shrill cry dick leaped to his feet then i grew dizzy and my sight blurred i heard hoarse shouts and saw dark forms rising as if out of the earth all was confusion i wanted to run but could not get up there was a wrestling whirling mass in front of me  but this dimness of sight and weakness of body did not last i saw two men on the ground with dick standing over them stockton was closing in greaser ran around them with something in his hand that glittered in the firelight stockton dived for dicks legs and upset him they went down together and the mexican leaped on them waving the bright thing high over his head  i bounded forward and grasping his wrist with both hands i wrenched his arm with all my might some one struck me over the head i saw a million darting points of lightthen all went black  when i opened my eyes the sun was shining i had a queer numb feeling all over and my head hurt terribly everything about me was hazy i did not know where i was after a little i struggled to sit up and with great difficulty managed it my hands were tied then it all came back to me stockton stood before me holding a tin cup of water toward my lips my throat was parched and i drank stockton had a great bruise on his forehead his nostrils were crusted with blood and his shirt was half torn off  youre all right he said  sure i replied which was not true  i imagined that a look of relief came over his face next i saw bill nursing his eye and bathing it with a wet handkerchief it was swollen shut puffed out to the size of a gooseegg and blue as indigo dick had certainly landed hard on bill then i turned round to see dick sitting against the little sapling bound fast with a lasso his clean face did not look as if he had been in a fight he was smiling yet there was anxiety in his eyes  ken now youve played hob he said it was a reproach but his look made me proud  oh dick if you hadnt called out i exclaimed  darned if youre not right but it was a slick job and youll tickle jim to death i was an old woman but that cold knifeblade made me jump  i glanced round the camp for the mexican and bud and the fifth man but they were gone bill varied his occupation of the moment by kneading biscuit dough in a basin then there came such a severe pain in my head that i went blind for a little while whats the matter with my head who hit me i cried  bud slugged you with the butt of his pistol said dick and ken i think you saved me from being knifed by the greaser you twisted his arm half off he cursed all night ha there he comes now with your outfit  sure enough the mexican appeared on the trail leading my horses i was so glad to see hal that i forgot i was a prisoner but greasers sullen face and glittering eyes reminded me of it quickly enough i read treachery in his glance  bud rode into camp from the other direction and he brought a bunch of horses two of which i recognized as dicks the lumbermen set about getting breakfast and stockton helped me to what little i could eat and drink now that i was caught he did not appear at all mean or harsh i did not shrink from him and had the feeling that he meant well by me  the horses were saddled and bridled and dick and i still tied were bundled astride our mounts the packponies led the way with bill following i came next greaser rode behind me and dick was between bud and stockton so we traveled and no time was wasted i noticed that the men kept a sharp lookout both to the fore and the rear we branched off the main trail and took a steeper one leading up the slope we rode for hours there were moments when i reeled in my saddle but for the greater while i stood my pain and weariness well enough some time in the afternoon a shrill whistle ahead attracted my attention i made out two horsemen waiting on the trail  huh about time growled bill hyars buell an herkyjerky  as we approached i saw buell and the fellow with the queer name turned out to be no other than the absent man i had been wondering about he had been dispatched to fetch the lumberman  buell was superbly mounted on a sleek bay and he looked very much the same jovial fellow i had met on the train he grinned at the disfigured men  take it from me you fellers wouldnt look any worse bunged up if youd been jolted by the sawlogs in my mill  we cant stand here to crack jokes said stockton sharply some ranger might see us now what  you ketched the kid in time thats all i wanted take him an leslie up in one of the canyons an keep them there till further orders you neednt stay stockton after you get them in a safe place an you can send up grub  then he turned to me  youll not be hurt if  dont you speak to me i burst out it was on my lips to tell him of the letter to washington but somehow i kept silent  leslie went on buell ill overlook your hittin me an let you go if youll give me your word to keep mum about this  dick did not speak but looked at the lumberman with a dark gleam in his eyes  theres one thing buell said stockton jim williams is wise youve got to look out for him  buells ruddy face blanched then without another word he waved his hand toward the slope and wheeling his horse galloped down the trail     ix taken into the mountains  we climbed to another level bench where we branched off the trail the forest still kept its open parklike character under the great pines the ground was bare and brown with a thick covering of pineneedles but in the glades were green grass and blue flowers  once across this level we encountered a steeper ascent than any i had yet climbed here the character of the forest began to change there were other trees than pines and particularly one kind coneshaped symmetrical and bright which dick called a silver spruce i was glad it belonged to the conifers or pinetree family because it was the most beautiful tree i had ever seen we climbed ridges and threaded through aspen thickets in hollows till near sunset then stockton ordered a halt for camp  it came none too soon for me and i was so exhausted that i had to be helped off my mustang stockton arranged my blankets fed me and bathed the bruise on my head but i was too weary and sick to be grateful or to care about anything except sleep even the fact that my hands were uncomfortably bound did not keep me awake  when some one called me next morning my eyes did not want to stay open i had a lazy feeling and a dull ache in my bones but the pain had gone from my head that made everything else seem all right  soon we were climbing again and my interest in my surroundings grew as we went up for a while we brushed through thickets of scrub oak the whole slope of the mountain was ridged and hollowed so that we were always going down and climbing up the pines and spruces grew smaller and were more rugged and gnarled  hyars the canyon sang out bill presently  we came out on the edge of a deep hollow it was half a mile wide i looked down a long incline of sharp treetips the roar of water rose from below and in places a white rushing torrent showed above loomed the snowclad peak glistening in the morning sun how wonderfully far off and high it still was  to my regret it was shut off from my sight as we descended into the canyon however i soon forgot that i saw a troop of coyotes and many black and white squirrels from time to time huge birds almost as big as turkeys crashed out of the thickets and whirred away they flew swift as pheasants and i asked dick what they were  blue grouse he replied look sharp now ken there are deer ahead of us see the tracks  looking down i saw little sharppointed oval tracks presently two foxes crossed an open patch not fifty yards from us but i did not get a glimpse of the deer soon we reached the bottom of the canyon and struck into another trail the air was full of the low roar of tumbling water this mountaintorrent was about twenty feet wide but its swiftness and foam made it impossible to tell its depth the trail led upstream and turned so constantly that half the time bill the leader was not in sight once the sharp crack of his rifle halted the train i heard crashings in the thicket dick yelled for me to look up the slope and there i saw three gray deer with white tails raised i heard a strange whistling sound  on going forward we found that bill had killed a deer and was roping it on his packhorse as we proceeded up the canyon it grew narrower and soon we entered a veritable gorge it was short but the floor was exceedingly rough and made hard going for the horses suddenly i was amazed to see the gorge open out into a kind of amphitheatre several hundred feet across the walls were steep and one side shelved out making a long shallow cave in the center of this amphitheatre was a deep hole from which the mountain stream boiled and bubbled  hyar we are said bill and swung out of his saddle the other men followed suit and helped dick and me down stockton untied our hands saying he reckoned we would be more comfortable that way indeed we were my wrists were swollen and blistered stockton detailed the mexican to keep guard over us  ken ive heard of this place said dick hows that for a spring twenty yards wide and no telling how deep this is snowwater straight from the peaks were not a thousand feet below the snowline  i can tell that look at those jwari pines i replied pointing up over the wall a rugged slope rose above our campsite and it was covered with a tangled mass of stunted pines many of them were twisted and misshapen some were half dead and bleached white at the tops its my first sight of such trees i went on but ive studied about them up here its not lack of moisture that stunts and retards their growth its fighting the elementscold stormwinds snowslides i suppose not one in a thousand seedlings takes root and survives but the forest fights hard to live  well ken we may as well sit back now and talk forestry till buell skins all he wants of penetier said dick its really a fine campingspot plenty of deer up here and bear too  dick couldnt we escape i whispered  were not likely to have a chance but i say ken how did you happen to turn up i thought you were going to hop on the first train for home  dick you had another think coming i couldnt go home ill have a great time yetim having it now  yes that lump on your head looks like it replied dick with a laugh if bud hadnt put you out wed have come closer to licking this bunch ken keep your eye on greaser hes treacherous his arms lame yet  weve had two runins already i said the third time is the worst they say i hope it wont come but dick im as bigim bigger than he is  hear the kid talk i certainly ought to have put you on that train  what train asked stockton sharply from our rear he took us in with suspicious eyes  i was telling ken i ought to have put him on a train for home answered dick  stockton let the remark pass without further comment still he appeared to be doing some hard thinking he put dick at one end of the long cave me at the other our bedding was unpacked and placed at our disposal we made our beds after that i kept my eyes open and did not miss anything  leslie im going to treat you and ward white said stockton youll have good grub herkyjerkys the best cook this side of holston and youll be left untied in the daytime but if either of you attempts to get away it means a leg shot off do you get that  all right stockton thats pretty square of you considering replied dick youre a decent sort of chap to be mixed up with a thief like buell im sorry  stockton turned away at this rather abruptly then bill appeared on the wall above and began to throw down firewood bud returned from the canyon where he had driven the horses greaser sat on a stone puffing a cigarette it was the first time i had taken a good look at him he was smaller than i had fancied his feet and hands and features resembled those of a woman but his eyes were live coals of black fire in the daylight i was not in the least afraid of him  herkyjerky was the most interesting one of our captors he had a short stocky figure and was the most bowlegged man i ever saw never on earth could he have stopped a pig in a lane a stubby beard covered the lower half of his brickred face the most striking thing about herkyjerky however was his perpetual grin he looked very jolly yet every time he opened his mouth it was to utter bad language he cursed the fire the pans the coffee the biscuits all of which he handled most skillfully it was disgusting and yet aside from this i rather liked him  it grew dark very quickly while we were eating and the wind that dipped down into the gorge was cold i kept edging closer and closer to the blazing campfire i had never tasted venison before and rather disliked it at first but i soon cultivated a liking for it  that night stockton tied me securely but in a way which made it easy for me to turn i slept soundly and awoke late when i sat up stockton stood by his saddled horse and was giving orders to the men he spoke sharply he made it clear that they were not to be lax in their vigilance then without a word to dick or me he rode down the gorge and disappeared behind a corner of yellow wall  bill untied the rope that held dicks arms but left his feet bound i was freed entirely and it felt so good to have the use of all my limbs once more that i pranced round in a rather lively way either my antics annoyed herkyjerky or he thought it a good opportunity to show his skill with a lasso for he shot the loop over me so hard that it stung my back  im all there as a roper he said pulling the lasso tight round my middle the men all laughed as i tumbled over in the gravel  better keep a halfhitch on the colt remarked bud  so they left the lasso fast about my waist and it trailed after me as i walked herkyjerky put me to carrying dicks breakfast from the campfire up into the cave this i did with alacrity dick and i exchanged commonplace remarks aloud but we had several little whispers  ken we may get the drop on them or give them the slip yet whispered dick in one of these interludes  this put ideas into my head there might be a chance for me to escape if not for dick i made up my mind to try if a good chance offered but i did not want to go alone down that canyon without a gun stockton had taken my revolver and huntingknife but i still had the little leather case which hal and i had used so often back on the susquehanna besides a penknife this case contained salt and pepper fishing hooks and lines matchesa host of little things that a boy who had never been lost might imagine he would need in an emergency while thinking and planning i sat on the edge of the great hole where the spring was suddenly i saw a swirl in the water and then a splendid spotted fish it broke water twice it was two feet long  dick theres fish in this hole i yelled eagerly  shouldnt wonder replied he sure kid thet holes full of troutspeckled trout said herkyjerky but they cant be ketched  why not i demanded i had not caught little trout in the pennsylvania hills for nothing they eat dont they that fish i saw was a whale and he broke water for a bug get me a pole and some bugs or worms  when i took out my little case and showed the fishingline herkyjerky said he would find me some bait  while he was absent i studied that spring with new and awakened eyes it was round and very deep and the water bulged up in great greenish swirls the outlet was a narrow little cleft through which the water flowed slowly as though it did not want to take its freedom the rush and roar came from the gorge below  herkyjerky returned with a long slender pole it was as pliant as a buggywhip and once trimmed and rigged it was far from being a poor tackle herkyjerky watched me with extreme attention all the time grinning then he held out a handful of grubs  if you ketch a trout on thet ill swaller the pole he exclaimed  i stooped low and approached the spring being careful to keep out of sight  you forgot to spit on yer bait kid said bill  they all laughed in a way to rouse my ire but despite it i flipped the bait into the water with the same old thrilling expectancy  the bait dropped with a little spat an arrowy shadow black and gold flashed up splash the line hissed then i jerked hard the pole bent double wobbled and swayed this way and that the fish was a powerful one his rushes were like those of a heavy bass but never had a bass given me such a struggle every instant i made sure the tackle would be wrecked then just at the breakingpoint the fish would turn at last he began to tire i felt that he was rising to the surface and i put on more strain soon i saw him then he turned flashing like a gold bar i led my captive to the outlet of the spring where i reached down and got my fingers in his gills with that i lifted him dick whooped when i held up the fish as for me i was speechless the trout was almost two feet long broad and heavy with shiny sides flecked with color  herkyjerky celebrated my luck with a generous outburst of enthusiasm whereupon his comrades reminded him of his offer to swallow my fishing pole  i put on a fresh bait and instantly hooked another fish a smaller one which was not so bard to land the spring hole was full of trout they made the water boil when i cast several large ones tore the hook loose i had never dreamed of such fishing really it was a strange situation here i was a prisoner with greaser or bud taking turns at holding the other end of the lasso more than once they tethered me up short for no other reason than to torment me yet never in my life had i so enjoyed fishing  byandby bill and herkyjerky left the camp i heard herky tell greaser to keep his eye on the stewpots and it occurred to me that greaser had better keep his eye on ken ward when i saw bud lie down i remembered what dick had whispered i pretended to be absorbed in my fishing but really i was watching greaser as usual he was smoking and appeared listless but he still held on to the lasso  suddenly i saw a big blue revolver lying on a stone and i could even catch the glint of brass shells in the cylinder it was not close to bud nor so very close to greaser if he should drop the lasso a wild idea possessed meheld me in its grip just then the stewpot boiled over there was a sputter and a cloud of steam greaser lazily swore in mexican he got up to move the stewpot and dropped the lasso  when he reached the fire i bounded up jerking the lasso far behind me i ran and grabbed the revolver greaser heard me and wheeled with a yell bud sat up quickly i pointed the revolver at him then at greaser and kept moving it from one side to the other  dont move ill shoot i cried  good boy yelled dick youve got the drop keep it ken keep it dont lose your nerve edge round here and cut me loose bud if you move ill make him shoot come on ken  greaser cut him loose i commanded the snarling mexican  i trembled so that the revolver wabbled in my hand trying to hold it steadied i squeezed it hard bang it went off with a bellow like a cannon the bullet scattered the gravel near greaser his yellow face turned a dirty white he jumped straight up in his fright  cut him loose i ordered  greaser ran toward dick  look out ken behind you quick yelled dick  i beard a crunching of gravel even as i wheeled i felt a tremendous pull on the lasso and i seemed to be sailing in the air i got a blurred glimpse of herkyjerky leaning back on the taut lasso then i plunged down slid over the rocks and went souse into the spring     x escape  down down i plunged and the shock of the icy water seemed to petrify me i should have gone straight to the bottom like a piece of lead but for the lasso it tightened around my chest and began to haul me up  i felt the air and the light and opened my eyes to see herkyjerky hauling away on the rope when he caught sight of me he looked as if ready to dodge behind the bank  whars my gun he yelled  i had dropped it in the spring he let the lasso sag and i had to swim then seeing that my hands were empty he began to swear and to drag me round and round in the pool when he had pulled me across he ran to the other side and jerked me back i was drawn through the water with a force that i feared would tear me apart greaser chattered like a hideous monkey and ran to and fro in glee herkyjerky soon had me sputtering gasping choking when he finally pulled me out of the hole i was all but drowned  you bowlegged beggar shouted dick ill fix you for that  whars my gun yelled herky as i fell to the ground  i lostit i panted  he began to rave then i half swooned and when sight and hearing fully returned i was lying in the cave on my blankets a great lassitude weighted me down the terrible thrashing about in the icy water had quenched my spirit for a while i was too played out to move and lay there in my wet clothes finally i asked leave to take them off bud who had come back in the meantime helped me or i should never have got out of them herky brought up my coat which fortunately i had taken off before the ducking i did not have the heart to speak to dick or look at him so i closed my eyes and fell asleep  it was another day when i awoke i felt all right except for a soreness under my arms and across my chest where the lasso had chafed and bruised me still i did not recover my good spirits herkyjerky kept on grinning and cracking jokes on my failure to escape he had appropriated my revolver for himself and he asked me several times if i wanted to borrow it to shoot greaser  that day passed quietly and so did the two that followed the men would not let me fish nor move about they had been expecting stockton and as he did not come it was decided to send bud down to the mill in fact bud decided the matter himself he warned greaser and herky to keep close watch over dick and me then he rode away dick and i resumed our talk about forestry and as we were separated by the length of the cave it was necessary to speak loud so our captors heard every word we said  ken whats the difference between government forestry out here and say forestry practiced by a farmer back in pennsylvania asked dick  theres a big difference i imagine forestry is established in some parts of the east its only an experiment out here  then i went on to tell him about the method of the farmer he usually had a small piece of forest mostly hard wood when the snow was on he cut firewood fencerails and lumber for his own use in building some seasons lumber brought high prices then he would select matured logs and haul them to the sawmill but he would not cut a great deal and he would use care in the selection it was his aim to keep the land well covered with forest he would sow as well as harvest  now the government policy is to preserve the national forests for the use of the people the soil must be kept productive agriculture would be impossible without water and the forests hold water the west wants people to come to stay the lumberman who slashes off the timber may get rich himself but he ruins the land  whats that new law congress is trying to pass queried dick  i was puzzled but presently i caught his meaning bill and herkyjerky were hanging on our words with unconcealed attention even the mexican was listening dicks cue was to scare them or at least to have some fun at their expense  theyve passed it i replied fellows like buell will go to the penitentiary for life his menll get twenty years on bread and water no whiskey serves em right  whatll the president do when he learns these men kidnapped you  do hell have the whole forest service out here and the national guard hes a friend of my fathers why these kidnappers will be hanged  i wish the guard would come quick too bad you couldnt have sent word id enjoy seeing greaser swing say he hasnt a ghost of a chance with the president and jim williams after him  dick i want the rings in greasers ears  what for theyre only brass  souvenirs maybe ill have watchcharms made of them anyway i can show them to my friends back east  itll be greatwhat youll have to tell went on dick itll be funny too  greaser had begun to snarl viciously and herky and bill looked glum and thoughtful the arrival of bud interrupted the conversation and put an end to our playful mood we heard a little of what he told his comrades and gathered that jim williams had met stockton and had asked questions hard to answer dick flashed me a significant look which was as much as to say that jim was growing suspicious bud had brought a store of whiskey and his companions now kept closer company with him than ever before but from appearances they did not get all they wanted  weve got to move this here camp said bud  bud and bill and herky walked off down the gorge perhaps they really went to find another place for the camp for the present spot was certainly a kind of trap but from the looks of greaser i guessed that they were leaving him to keep guard while they went off to drink by themselves greaser muttered and snarled as the moments passed his face grew sullen  all at once he came toward me he bound my hands and my feet dick was already securely tied but greaser put another lasso on him then he slouched down the gorge his highpeaked mexican sombrero bobbed above the rocks then disappeared  ken nows the chance said dick low and quick if you can only work loose theres your rifle and mine too we could hold this fort for a month  what can i do i asked straining on my ropes  youre not fast to the rock as i am rollover here and untie me with your teeth  i raised my head to get the direction and then with a violent twist of my body i started toward him but being bound fast i could not guide myself and i rolled off the ledge the bank there was pretty steep and unable to stop i kept on like a barrel going downbill the thought of rolling into the spring filled me with horror suddenly i bumped hard into something that checked me it was a log of firewood and in one end stuck the big knife which herkyjerky used to cut meat  instantly i conceived the idea of cutting my bonds with this knife but how was i to set about it  dick heres a knife howll i get to it so as to free myself  easy as pie replied he eagerly the sharp edge points down you hitch yourself this waythats itgood  what dick called easy as pie was the hardest work i ever did i lay flat on my back bound hand and foot and it was necessary to jerk my body along the log till my hands should be under the knife i lifted my legs and edged along inch by inch  fine work ken now youre right turn on your side be careful you dont loosen the knife  not only were my wrists bound but the lasso had been wrapped round my elbows holding them close to my body turning on my side i found that i could not reach the knifenot by several inches this was a bitter disappointment i strained and heaved in my effort to lift my body sidewise i pressed my face into the gravel hurry ken hurry cried dick somebodys coming  thus urged i grew desperate in my struggle i discovered that it was possible to edge up on the log and stick there i glued myself to that log by dint of great exertion i brought the tight cord against the blade it parted with a little snap my elbows dropped free raising my wrists i sawed quickly through the bonds i cut myself the blood flowed but that was no matter jerking the knife from the log i severed the ropes round my ankles and leaped up  hurry boy cried dick with a sharp note of alarm  i ran to where he lay and attacked the heavy halter with which he had been secured i had cut half through the knots when a shrill cry arrested me it was the mexicans voice  head him off hes after your gun yelled dick  the sight of greaser running toward the cave put me into a frenzy dropping the knife i darted to where my rifle leaned across my saddle but i saw the mexican would beat me to it checking my speed i grabbed up a round stone and let fly that was where my ballplaying stood me in good stead for the stone hit greaser on the shoulder knocking him flat but he got up and lunged for the rifle just as i reached him  i kicked the rifle out of his band grappled with him and down we went together we wrestled and thrashed off the ledge and when we landed in the gravel i was on top  slug him ken yelled dick wildly oh thats fine give it to him punch him get his wind  either it was a mortal dread of greasers knife or some kind of a newborn fury that lent me such strength he screeched he snapped like a wolf he clawed me he struck me but he could not shake me off several times he had me turning but a hard rap on his head knocked him back again then i began to bang him in the ribs  thats the place shouted dick ken youre going to do him up soak him ohh but this is great  i kept the advantage over greaser but still he punished me cruelly suddenly he got his snaky hands on my throat and began to choke me with all my might i swung my fist into his stomach  his hands dropped his mouth opened in a gasp his face turned green the blow had made him horribly sick and he sank back utterly helpless i jumped up with a shout of triumph  run run for it yelled dick in piercing tones theyre coming never mind me run i tell you not down the gorge climb out  for a moment i could not move out of my tracks then i saw bill and herky running up the gorge and farther down bud staggering and lurching  this lent me wings in two jumps i had grabbed my rifle then turning i ran round the pool and started up the one place in the steep wall where climbing was possible above the yells of the men i heard dicks piercing cry  gogogo ken  i sent the loose rocks down in my flight here i leaped up there i ran along a little ledge in another place i climbed hand and foot the last few yards was a gravelly incline i seemed to slide back as much as i gained  come back hyar bawled bill  crack crack crack the reports rang out in quick succession a bullet whistled over me another struck the gravel and sent a shower of dust into my face i pitched my rifle up over the bank and began to dig my fingers and toes into the loose ground as i gained the top two more bullets sang past my head so close that i knew bill was aiming to more than scare me i dragged myself over the edge and was safe  the canyon with its dense thickets and scrubby clumps of trees lay below in plain sight once hidden there i would be hard to find picking up my rifle i ran swiftly along the base of the slope and soon gained the cover of the woods     xi the old hunter  i ran till i got a stitch in my side and then slowed down to a dogtrot the one thing to do was to get a long way ahead of my pursuers for surely at the outset they would stick like hounds to my trail  a mile or more below the gorge i took to the stream and waded it was slippery dangerous work for the current tore about my legs and threatened to upset me after a little i crossed to the left bank here the slope of the canyon was thick with grass that hid my tracks it was a long climb up to the level upon reaching it i dropped exhausted  ivegiven themthe slip i panted exultantly butnow what  it struck me that now i was free i had only jumped out of the fryingpan into the fire hurriedly i examined my winchester the magazine contained ten cartridges what luck that stockton had neglected to unload it this made things look better i had salt and pepper a knife and matchesthanks to the little leather caseand so i could live in the woods  it was too late for regrets i might have freed dick somehow or even held the men at bay but i had thought only of escape the lack of nerve and judgment stung me then i was bitter over losing my mustang and outfit  but on thinking it all over i concluded that i ought to be thankful for things as they were i was free with a whole skin that climb out of the gorge had been no small risk how those bullets had whistled and hissed  im pretty lucky i muttered now to get good and clear of this vicinity theyll ride down the trail after me better go over this ridge into the next canyon and strike down that i must go down but how far what must i strike for  i took a long look at the canyon in places the stream showed also the trail then there were open patches but i saw no horses or men with a grim certainty that i should be lost in a very little while i turned into the cool dark forest  every stone and log every bit of hard ground in my path served to help hide my trail herkyjerky very likely had the cowboys skill at finding tracks but i left few traces of my presence on that long slope only an indian or a hound could have trailed me the timber was small and rough brush grew everywhere presently i saw light ahead and i came to an open space it was a wide swath in the forest at once i recognized the path of an avalanche it sloped up clean and bare to the gray cliffs far above below was a great mass of trees and rocks all tangled in black splintered ruin i pushed on across the path into the forest and up and down the hollows the sun had gone down behind the mountain and the shadows were gathering when i came to another large canyon it looked so much like the first that i feared i had been travelling in a circle but this one seemed wider deeper and there was no roar of rushing water  it was time to think of making camp and so i hurried down the slope at the bottom i found a small brook winding among boulders and ledges of rock the far side of this canyon was steep and craggy soon i discovered a place where i thought it would be safe to build a fire my clothes were wet and the air had grown keen and cold gathering a store of wood i made my fire in a niche for a bed i cut some sweetscented pine boughs i thought they must be from a balsamtree and these i laid close up in a rocky corner thus i had the fire between me and the opening and with plenty of wood to burn i did not fear visits from bears or lions at last i lay down dry and warm indeed but very tired and hungry  darkness closed in upon me i saw a few stars heard the cheery crackle of my fire and then i fell asleep twice in the night i awakened cold but by putting on more firewood i was soon comfortable again  when i awoke the sun was shining brightly into my rocky bedchamber the fire had died out completely there was frost on the stones to build up another fire and to bathe my face in the icewater of the brook were my first tasks the air was sweet it seemed to freeze as i breathed and was a bracing tonic i was tingling all over and as hungry as a starved wolf  i set forth on a hunt for game even if the sound of a shot betrayed my whereabouts i should have to abide by it for i had to eat stepping softly along i glanced about me with sharp eyes deer trails were thick the bottom of this canyon was very wide and grew wider as i proceeded then the pines once more became large and thrifty i judged i had come down the mountain perhaps a couple of thousand feet below the camp in the gorge i flushed many of the big blue grouse and i saw numerous coyotes a fox and a large brown beast which moved swiftly into a thicket it was enough to make my heart rise in my throat to dream of hunting bears was something vastly different from meeting one in a lonely canyon  just after this i saw a herd of deer they were a good way off i began to slip from tree to tree and drew closer presently i came to a little hollow with a thick short patch of underbrush growing on the opposite side something crashed in the thicket then two beautiful deer ran out one bounded leisurely up the slope the other with long ears erect stopped to look at me it was no more than fifty yards away trembling with eagerness i leveled my rifle i could not get the sight to stay steady on the deer even then with the rifle wobbling in my intense excitement i thought of how beautiful that wild creature was straining every nerve i drew the sight till it was in line with the gray shape then fired the deer leaped down the slope staggered and crumpled down in a heap  i tore through the bushes and had almost reached the bottom of the hollow when i remembered that a wounded deer was dangerous so i halted the gray form was as still as stone i ventured closer the deer was dead my bullet had entered high above the shoulder at the juncture of the neck though i had only aimed at him generally i took a good deal of pride in my first shot at a deer  fortunately my penknife had a fairsized blade with it i decided to cut out part of the deer and carry it back to my camp then it occurred to me that i might as well camp where i was there were several jumbles of rock and a cliff within a stonesthrow of where i stood besides i must get used to making camp wherever i happened to be accordingly i took hold of the deer and dragged him down the hollow till i came to a leaning slab of rock  skinning a deer was of course new to me i haggled the flesh somewhat and cut through the skin often my knifeblade being much too small for such work finally i thought it would be enough for me to cut out the haunches and then i got down to one haunch it had bothered me how i was going to sever the joint but to my great surprise i found there did not seem to be any connection between the bones the haunch came out easily and i hung it up on a branch while making a fire  herkyjerkys method of broiling a piece of venison at the end of a stick solved the problem of cooking then it was that the little flat flask full of mixed salt and pepper rewarded me for the long carrying of it i was hungry and i feasted  by this time the sun shone warm and the canyon was delightful i roamed around sat on sunny stones and lay in the shade of pines deer browsed in the glades when they winded or saw me they would stand erect shoot up their long cars and then leisurely lope away coyotes trotted out of thickets and watched me suspiciously i could have shot several but deemed it wise to be saving of my ammunition once i heard a low drumming i could not imagine what made it then a big blue grouse strutted out of a patch of bushes he spread his wings and tail and neck feathers after the fashion of a turkeygobbler it was a flap or shake of his wings that produced the drumming i wondered if he intended by his actions to frighten me away from his mates nest so i went toward him and got very close before he flew i caught sight of his mate in the bushes and as i had supposed she was on a nest though wanting to see her eggs or young ones i resisted the temptation for i was afraid if i went nearer she might abandon her nest as some mother birds do  it did not seem to me that i was lost yet lost i was the peaks were not in sight the canyon widened down the slope and i was pretty sure that it opened out flat into the great pine forest of penetier the only thing that bothered me was the loss of my mustang and outfit i could not reconcile myself to that so i wandered about with a strange full sense of freedom such as i had never before known what was to be the end of my adventure i could not guess and i wasted no time worrying over it  the knowledge i had of forestry i tried to apply i studied the north and south slopes of the canyon observing how the trees prospered on the sunny side certain saplings of a species unknown to me had been gnawed fully ten feet from the ground this puzzled me squirrels could not have done it nor rabbits nor birds presently i hit upon the solution the bark and boughs of this particular sapling were food for deer and to gnaw so high the deer must have stood upon six or seven feet of snow  i dug into the soft duff under the pines this covering of the roots was very thick and deep i made it out to be composed of pineneedles leaves and earth it was like a sponge no wonder such covering held the water i pried bark off dead trees and dug into decayed logs to find the insect enemies of the trees the open places where little colonies of pine sprouts grew seemed generally to be downslope from the parent trees it was easy to tell the places where the wind had blown the seeds  the hours sped by the shadows of the pines lengthened the sun set and the shade deepened in the hollows returning to my camp i cooked my supper and made my bed when i had laid up a store of firewood it was nearly dark  with night came the coyotes the carcass of the deer attracted them and they approached from all directions at first it was fascinating to hear one howl far off in the forest and then to notice the difference in the sound as he came nearer and nearer the way they barked and snapped out there in the darkness was as wild a thing to hear as any boy could have wished for it began to be a little too much for me i kept up a bright fire and though not exactly afraid i had a perch picked out in the nearest tree suddenly the coyotes became silent then a low continuous growling a snapping of twigs and the unmistakable drag of a heavy body over the ground made my hair stand on end gripping my rifle i listened i heard the crunch of teeth on bones then more sounds of something being dragged down the hollow the coyotes began to bark again but now far back in the forest  some beast had frightened them what was it i did not know whether a bear would eat deer flesh but i thought not perhaps timberwolves had disturbed the coyotes but would they run from wolves it came to me suddenlya mountainlion  i hugged my fire and sat there listening with all my ears imagining every rustle of leaf to be the step of a lion it was long before the thrills and shivers stopped chasing over me longer before i could decide to lie down but after a while the dead quiet of the forest persuaded me that the night was far advanced and i fell asleep  the first thing in the morning i took my rifle and went out to where i had left the carcass of the deer it was gone it had been dragged away a dark path on the pineneedles and grass and small bushes pressed to the ground plainly marked the trail but search as i might i could not find the track of the animal that had dragged off the deer after following the trail for a few rods i decided to return to camp and cook breakfast before going any farther while i was at it i cut many thin slices of venison and after roasting them i stored them away in the capacious pocket of my coat  my breakfast finished i again set out to see what had become of the remains of the deer in two or three places the sharp hoofs had cut lines in the soft earth and there were tufts of whitishgray hair elsewhere a hundred yards or more down the hollow i came to a bare spot where recently there had been a pool of water here i found cat tracks as large as my two hands i had never seen the track of a mountainlion but all the same i knew that this was the real thing what an enormous brute he must have been i cast fearful glances into the surrounding thickets  it was not needful to travel much farther under a bush well hidden in a clump of trees lay what now remained of my deer a patch of gray hair a few long bones a split skull and two long earsno more even the hide was gone perhaps the coyotes had finished the job after the lion had gorged himself but i did not think so it seemed to me that coyotes would have scattered the remains those two long ears somehow seemed pathetic i wished for a second that the lion were in range of my rifle  the lion was driven from my mind when i saw a troop of deer cross a glade below me i had to fight myself to keep from shooting the wind blew rather strong in my face which probably accounted for the deer not winding me  then the whiplike crack of a rifle riveted me where i stood one of the deer fell and the others bounded away i saw a tall man stride down the slope and into the glade he was not like any of the loggers or lumbermen they were mostly brawny and roundshouldered this man was lithe erect he walked like athletes i had seen surely i should find a friend in him and i lost no time in running down into the glade he saw me as soon as i was clear of the trees and stood leaning on his rifle  wal doggone my buttons he ejaculated whore you  i blurted out all about myself at the same time taking stock of him he was not young but i had never seen a young man so splendid hair beard and skin were all of a dark gray his eyes too were graythe keenest and clearest i had ever looked into they shone with a kindly light otherwise i might have thought his face hard and stern his shoulders were very wide his arms long his hands enormous his buckskin shirt attracted my attention to his other clothes which looked like leather overalls or heavy canvas a belt carried a huge knife and a number of shells of large caliber the winchester he had was exceedingly long and heavy and of an old pattern the look of him brought back my old fancy of wetzel or kit carson  so im lost i concluded and dont know what to do i darent try to find the sawmill i wont go back to holston just yet  an why not youngster pears to me youd better make tracks from penetier  i told him why at which he laughed  wal i reckon you can stay with me fer a spell my camps in the head of this canyon  oh thank you thatll be fine i exclaimed my great good luck filled me with joy do you stay on the mountain  ben here goin on eighteen years youngster mebbe youve heerd my name hiram bent  are you a hunter  wal i reckon so though im more a trapper here you pack my gun  with that he drew his knife and set to work on the deer it was wonderful to see his skill in a few cuts and strokes a ripping of the hide and a powerful slash he had cut out a haunch it took even less work for the second then he hung the rest of the deer on a snag and wiped his knife and hands on the grass  come on youngster he said starting up the canyon  i showed him where the carcass of my deer had been devoured  cougar thars a big feller has the run of this canyon  cougar i thought it was a mountainlion  cougar painter panther lionall the same critter an if you leave him alone hell not bother you but hes bad in a corner  he scared away the coyotes  youngster even a silvertipthets a grizzly bearwill make tracks away from a cougar i lent my pack of hounds to a pard over near springer if i had them wed put thet cougar up a tree in no time  are there many lionscougars here  only a few thets why theres plenty of deer other game is plentiful too foxes wolves an up in the mountains bears are thick  then i may get to see oneget a shot at one  wal i reckon  from that time i trod on air i found myself wishing for my brother hal i became reconciled to the loss of mustang and outfit for a moment i almost forgot dick and buell forestry seemed less important than hunting i had read a thousand books about old hunters and trappers and here i was in a wild mountain canyon with a hunter who might have stepped out of one of my dreams so i trudged along beside him asking a question now and then and listening always he certainly knew what would interest me there was scarcely a thing he said that i would ever forget after a while however the trail became so steep and rough that i at least had no breath to spare for talking we climbed and climbed the canyon had become a narrow rocky cleft huge stones blocked the way a ragged growth of underbrush fringed the stream dead pines with branches like spears lay along the trail  we came upon a little clearing where there was a rude logcabin with a stone chimney skins of animals were tacked upon logs under the bank was a spring the mountain overshadowed this wild nook  wal youngster heres my shack make yourself to home said hiram bent  i was all eyes as we entered the cabin skins large and small and of many colors hung upon the walls a fire burned in a wide stone grate a rough table and some pans and cooking utensils showed evidence of recent scouring a bunch of steel traps lay in a corner upon a shelf were tin cans and cloth bags and against the wall stood a bed of glossy bearskins to me the cabin was altogether a most satisfactory place  i reckon yere tired asked the hunter thets some pumpkins of a climb unless youre used to it  i admitted i was pretty tired  wal rest awhile you look like you hadnt slept much  he asked me about my people and home and was so interested in forestry that he left off his task of the moment to talk about it i was not long in discovering that what he did not know about trees and forests was hardly worth learning he called it plain woodcraft he had never heard of forestry all the same i hungered for his knowledge how lucky for me to fall in with him the things that had puzzled me about the pines he answered easily then he volunteered information from talking of the forest he drifted to the lumbermen  wal the lumbersharks are rippin holes in penetier i reckon they wouldnt stop at nothin ive heered some tough stories about thet sawmill gang i aint acquainted with leslie or any of them fellers you named except jim williams i knowed jim he was in springer fer a while if jims your friend therell be somethin happenin when he rounds up them kidnappers i reckon youd better hang up with me fer a while you dont want to get ketched again your life wasnt much to them fellers i think theyd held on to you fer money its too bad you didnt send word home to your people  i sent word home about the big steal of timber that was before i got kidnapped by this time the government knows  wal you dont say thet was pert of you youngster an will the government round up these sharks  indeed it will the government is in dead earnest about protecting the national forests  so it ought to be next to a forest fire i hate these skinned timber tracts wal old penetiers going to see somethin lively before long youngster them lumbermenleastways them fellers you call bud an bill an suchtheyre goin to fight  the old hunter left me presently and went outside i waited awhile for him but as he did not return i lay down upon the bearskins and dropped to sleep it seemed i had hardly closed my eyes when i felt a hand on my arm and heard a voice  wake up youngster thars two old bears an a cub been foolin with one of my traps  in a flash i was wide awake  lets see your gun humph pretty small38 caliber aint it wal itll do the work if you hold straight can you shoot  fairly well  he took his heavy winchester and threw a coil of thin rope over his shoulder  come on stay close to me an keep your eyes peeled     xii bears  the old hunter walked so swiftly that i had to run to keep up with him the trail led up the creek now on one side again on the other and i was constantly skipping from stone to stone the grassy slopes grew fewer and finally gave way altogether to cracked cliffs and weathered rocks a fringe of pinetrees leaned over the top with here and there a blasted spear standing out white  i had my trap set up thet draw said hiram bent as he pointed toward an intersecting canyon just before i waked you i was comin along here an i heered an allfired racket up thar an so i watched soon three black bears come paddlin down an the biggest was draggin the trap with the chain an log then i hurried to tell you they cant be far  are they grizzlies i asked trying to speak naturally  nope jest plain black bears but the one with the trap is a whopper hell go over four hundred see the tracks looks like somebodyd been plowin up the stones  there were deep tracks in the sand and broad furrows and stones overturned and places where a heavy object had crushed the gravel even and smooth  the old hunter kept striding on and i wondered bow he could go so fast without running presently we came to where the canyon forked hiram started up the righthand fork then suddenly stopped and turning began to go back carefully examining the ground  theyve split on us he explained the ole feller with the trap went up the righthand draw an the mother an cub took to the left now youngster can you keep your nerve  i think so  wal you go after the ole feller you cant miss him an he wont be far youll hear him bellerin long before you git to him though he might lay low so you steer clear of big boulders an thickets kill him an then run back an take up this draw the she bear is cute an may give me the slip but if she doesnt climb out soon ill head her off hurry on now keep your eye peeled an youll be safe as if you were to home  with that he disappeared round the corner of stone wall where the canyon divided i wheeled and went to the right this wing of the canyon twisted and turned and was full of stones a shallow sheet of water gleamed over its colored bed of gravel the walls were straight up and in places bulged outward i flinched at every turn in the canyon but with rifle cocked and thrust forward i went on the cracks in the walls the boulders and pieces of cliff that obstructed my path and the occasional thicketsall made me halt with careful step and finger on the trigger i followed the splashes on the stones which told me that the bear had passed that way as i went cautiously on i felt a tightening at my throat the light above grew dimmer when i stopped to listen it was so silent that i heard only the pounding of my heart and my own quick breathing i pressed on and on going faster all the time not that i felt braver but i longed to end the suspense suddenly the silence was broken by a threatening roar it swept down on me swelling as it continued and it seemed to fill the canyon it shook my pulses it urged me to flight but i could not move then as suddenly it ceased  for a long moment i stood still with no idea of advancing farther the clinking of a chain seemed to release my cramped muscles very cautiously i peered around a projecting corner of wall there sat a huge black bear on his haunches holding up a great steel trap which clutched one of his paws it was such a strange sight that my fear was forgotten there was something almost human in the way the bear looked at that trap he touched it gingerly with his free paw and nosed it i crept up close to the corner of stone and looked around again the bear was now close to me i saw the heavy chain and the log to which it was attached he looked at trap and log in a grave pathetic way as if trying to reason about them then he roused into furious action swinging the trap dragging the log and bellowing in such a frightful manner that i dodged back behind the wall  but this sudden change in the bear this appalling roar with its note of pain awakened me to his suffering when the noise stopped and i looked again the bear was a sight not to be forgotten he showed a helpless terrible fear of the steeljawed thing on his foot he dropped down on the sand with a groan and there was a despairing look in his eyes  this made me forget my fear and i had only one thoughtto put him out of his misery when i leveled my rifle it was as steady as the rock beside me aiming just below his ear i pressed the trigger the dull report reechoed from wall to wall the bear lurched slightly and his head fell upon his outstretched paws i waited ready to shoot again upon the slightest movement but there was none  with rifle ready i cautiously approached the bear as i came close he seemed larger and larger but he showed no signs of life i looked at the glossy black fur the flecks of blood on the side of his head where my bullet had entered the murderous sawteeth of the heavy trap biting to the bone and the cruelty of that trap seemed to drive from me all pride of achievement it was nothing except mercy to kill a trapped crippled bear that could not run or fight then and there i gained a dislike for trapping animals  the crack of the old hunters rifle made me remember that i was to hurry back up the other canyon so i began to run i bounded from stone to stone dashed over the sandbars jumped the brook and went down that canyon perhaps in far greater danger of bodily harm than when i had gone up  but when i turned the corner it was another story the first canyon had been easy climbing compared to this one it was narrow steep and full of dead pines fallen from above running was impossible i clambered upward over the loose stones under the bridges of pines round the boulders presently i heard a shout i could not tell where it came from but i replied a second call i identified as coming from high up the ragged canyon side and i started up it was hard work certainly no bears or hunter had climbed out just here at length sore spent and torn i fell out of a tangle of brush upon the edge of the canyon above me rose the swelling mountain slope thickly covered with dwarf pines  this way youngster called the old hunter from my left  a few more dashes in and out of the brush and trees brought me to a fairly open space with not much slope hiram bent stood under a pine and at his feet lay a black furry mass  wal i heerd you shoot reckon you got yourn  yes i killed him say mr bent i dont like traps  nary do ifor bears replied he shaking his gray head a trapped bear is about the pitifulest thing i ever seen but its seldom one ever gits into trap of mine  this one you shot must be the old mother bear wheres the cub did it get away  not yet lookup in the tree  i looked up the black trunk through the network of slender branches and saw the bear snuggling in a fork his sharp ears stood up against the sky he was most anxiously gazing down at us  wal tumble him out of thar said hiram bent  with a natural impulse to shoot i raised my rifle but the cub looked so attractive and so helpless that i hesitated  i dont like to do it i said oh i wish we could catch him alive  wal i reckon we can  how i inquired eagerly and lowered my rifle  are you good on the climb  climb this tree why with one hand back in pennsylvania i climbed shellbark hickorytrees with the lowest limb fifty feet from the ground  but there werent any bears up them  you must keep out of his way if he comes down on you hes a sassy little chap now take this rope an go up an climb round him  climb round him i queried as i gazed dubiously upward you mean to slip out on the branches and go up handoverhand till i get above him the branches up there seem pretty closei might but suppose he goes higher  im lookin fer him to go clean to the top but you can beat him to itmebbe  any danger of his attacking meup there  wal not much if he hugs the trunk hell have to hold on fer all hes worth but if he stands on the branches an you come up close he might bat you one mebbe id better go up  oh im goingi only wanted to know what to expect now in case i get above him what then  make him back down till he reaches these first branches when he gets so far ill tell you what to do i put my arm through the coil of rope and slinging it snugly over my shoulder began to climb the pine it was the work of only a moment to reach the first branch  wal i reckon youre some relation to a squirrel at thet said hiram bent jest as i thought the little cuss is climbin higher thets goin to worry us  it was like stepping up a ladder from the first branch to the fork the cub had gone up the righthand trunk some fifteen feet and was now hugging it at that short distance he looked alarmingly big but i saw he would have all he could do to hold on and if i could climb the left trunk and get above him there would be little to fear how i did it so quickly was a mystery but amid the cracking of dead branches and pattering of falling bark and swaying of the treetop i gained a position above him  he was so close that i could smell him his quick little eyes snapped fire and fear at once he uttered a sound that was between a whine and a growl  hey youngster yelled hiram thets high enoughtaint safebe careful now  with the words i looked out below me to see the old hunter standing in the glade waving his arms  im all right i yelled down now howll i drive him  break off a branch an switch him  there was not a branch above me that i could break but a few feet below was a slender dead limb i slid down and got it and holding on with my left arm and legs i began to thrash the cub he growled fiercely snapped at the stick and began to back down  hes started i cried in glee go on cubbydown with you  clumsy as he was he made swift time i was hard put to keep close to him i slipped down the trunkholding on one instant and sliding down the next but below the fork it was harder for cubby and easier for me the branches rather hindered his backward progress while they aided mine growling and whining with long claws ripping the bark he went down all of a sudden i became aware of the old hunter threshing about under the tree  hold onnot so fast he yelled  still the cub kept going and stopped with his haunches on the first branch there looking down he saw an enemy below him and hesitated but he looked up and seeing me began to back down again hiram pounded the tree with a dead branch cubby evidently intended to reach the ground for the noise did not stop him then the hunter ran a little way to a windfall and came back with the upper half of a dead sapling with this he began to prod the bear thereupon cubby lost no time in getting up to the first branch again where he halted  throw the noose on him nowanywhere ordered the hunter an weve no time to lose hes gittin sassier every minnit  i dropped the wide loop upon cubby expecting to catch him first time the rope went over his bead but with a dexterous flip of his paw he sent it flying then began a duel between us in which he continually got the better of me all the while the old hunter prodded cubby from below  you aint quick enough said hiram impatiently  made reckless by this i stepped down to another branch directly over the bear and tried again to rope him it was of no use he slipped out of the noose with the sinuous movements of an eel once it caught over his ears and in his open jaws he gave a jerk that nearly pulled me from my perch i could tell he was growing angrier every instant and also braver suddenly the noose quite by accident caught his nose he wagged his head and i pulled the noose tightened  ive got him i yelled and gave the rope a strong pull  the bear stood up with startling suddenness and reached for me  climb shouted hiram  i dropped the rope and leaped for the branch above and catching it lifted myself just as the sharp claws of the cub scratched hard over my boot  cubby now hugged the tree trunk and started up again  weve got him yelled hiram dont movestep on his nose if he gets too close  then i saw the halter had come off the bear and had fallen to the ground hiram picked it up arranged the noose and holding it in his teeth began to limb after the bear cubby was now only a few feet under me working steadily up growling and his little eyes were like points of green fire  stop him stand on his head mumbled hiram with the rope in his teeth  whatnot on your life  but reaching up i grasped a branch and swinging clear of the lower one i began to kick at the bear this stopped him then he squealed and began to kick on his own account hiram was trying to get the noose over a bind foot after several attempts he succeeded and then threw the rope over the lowest branch i gave a wild indian yell of triumph the next instant before i could find a foothold the branch to which i was hanging snapped like a pistolshot and i plunged down with a crash i struck the bear and the lower branch and then the ground the fall half stunned me i thought every bone in my body was broken i rose unsteadily and for a moment everything whirled before my eyes then i discovered that the roar in my ears was the old hunters yell i saw him hauling on the rope there was a great ripping of bark and many strange sounds and then the cub was dangling head downward hiram had pulled him from his perch and hung him over the lowest branch  thar youngster git busy now yelled the hunter grab the other ropethar it isan rope a front paw while i hold him lively now hes mighty heavy an if he ever gits down with only one rope on him well think were fast to chain lightnin  the bear swung about five feet from the ground as i ran at him with the noose he twisted himself seemed to double up in a knot then he dropped fullstretched again and lunged viciously at me twice i felt the wind of his paws he spun around so fast that it kept me dancing i flung the noose and caught his right paw hiram bawled something that made me all the more heedless and in tightening the noose i ran in too close the bear gave me a slashing cuff on the side of the head and i went down like a tenpin  git a hitch tharto the saplin roared hiram as i staggered to my feet rustle nowhurry  what with my ringing head and fingers all thumbs and hiram roaring at me i made a mess of tying the knot then hiram let go his rope and when the cub dropped to the ground the rope flew up over the branch cubby leaped so quickly that he jerked the rope away before hiram could pick it up and one hard pull loosened my hitch on the sapling  the cub bounded through the glade dragging me with him for a few long leaps i kept my feet then down i sprawled  hang on hang on hiram yelled from behind  if i had not been angry clear through at that cub i might have let go he ploughed my face in the dirt and almost jerked my arms off suddenly the strain lessened i got up to see that the old hunter had hold of the other rope  now stretch him out he yelled  between us we stretched the cub out so that all he could do was struggle and paw the air and utter strange cries hiram tied his rope to a tree and then ran back to relieve me it was high time he took my rope and fastened it to a stout bush  thar youngster i reckon thetll hold him now tie his paws an muzzle him  he drew some buckskin thongs from his pocket and handed them to me we went up to the straining cub and hiram with one pull of his powerful hands brought the hind legs together  tie em he said  this done with the aid of a heavy piece of wood he pressed the cubs head down and wound a thong tightly round the sharp nose then he tied the front legs  thar now you loosen the ropes an wind them up  when i had done this he lifted the cub and swung him over his broad back  come on you trail behind an keep your eye peeled to see he doesnt work thet knot off his jaws say youngster now youve got him what in thunder will you do with him  i looked at my torn trousers at the blood on my skinned and burning hands and i felt of the bruise on my head as i said grimly ill hang to him as long as i can     xiii the cabin in the forest  hiram bent packed the cub down the canyon as he would have handled a sack of oats when we reached the cabin he fastened a heavy dogcollar round cubbys neck and snapped a chain to it doubling the halter he tied one end to the chain and the other to a sturdy branch of a tree this done he slipped the thongs off the bear  thar hell let you pet him in a few days mebbe he said  our captive did not yet show any signs of becoming tame no sooner was he free of the buckskin thongs than he leaped away only to be pulled up by the halter then he rolled over and over clawing at the chain and squirming to get his head out of the collar  he might choke hisself said hiram but mebbe hell ease up if we stay away from him now weve got to rustle to skin them two bears  so after giving me a huntingknife and telling me to fetch my rifle he set off up the canyon as i trudged along behind him i spoke of dick leslie and asked if there were not some way to get him out of the clutches of the lumber thieves  ive been thinkin about thet replied the hunter an i reckon we can tomorrow well cross the ridge high up back of thet springhole canyon an sneak down pears to me them fellers will be trailin you pretty hard an mebbe theyll leave only one to guard leslie moren thet the trail up here to my shack is known an im thinkin wed be smart to go off an camp somewhere else  whatll i do about cubby i asked quickly  cubby oh thet bear cub wal take him along youngster you dont want to pack thet pesky cub back to pennsylvania  yes i do  i reckon it aint likely you can hes pretty heavy weighs nearly a hundred an hed make a heap of trouble mebbe well ketch a little cubone you can carry in your arms  thatd be still better i replied but if we dont ill try to take him back home  the old hunter said i made a good shot at the big bear and that he would give me the skin for a rug it delighted me to think of that huge glossy bearskin on the floor of my den i told hiram how the bear had suffered and i was glad to see that although he was a hunter and trapper he disliked to catch a bear in a trap we skinned the animal and cut out a quantity of meat he told me that bear meat would make me forget all about venison by the time we had climbed up the other canyon and skinned the other bear and returned to camp it was dark as for me i was so tired i could hardly crawl  in spite of my aches and pains that was a night for me to remember but there was the thought of dick leslie his rescue was the only thing needed to make me happy dick was in my mind even when hiram cooked a supper that almost made me forget my manners certainly the broiled bear meat made me forget venison then we talked before the burning logs in the stone fireplace hiram sat on his homemade chair and smoked a strongsmelling pipe while i lay on a bearskin in blissful ease occasionally we heard the cub outside rattling his chain and growling all of the trappers and indian fighters i had read of were different from hiram bent and jim williams jims soft drawl and kind twinkling eyes were not what any bookreader would expect to find in a dangerous man and hiram bent was so simple and friendly so glad to have even a boy to talk to that it seemed he would never stop if it had not been for his striking appearance and for the strange wild tales he told of his lonely life he would have reminded me of the old canallock tenders at home  once when he was refilling his pipe and i thought it would be a good time to profit from his knowledge of the forests i said to him  now mr bent lets suppose im the president of the united states and i have just appointed you to the office of chief forester of the national forests you have full power the object is to conserve our national resources what will you do  wal mr president he began slowly and seriously and with great dignity the government must own the forests an deal wisely with them these mountain forests are great sponges to hold the water an we must stop fire an reckless cuttin the first thing is to overcome the opposition of the stockmen an show them where the benefit will be theirs in the long run next the timber must be used but not all used up well need rangers whore used to rustlin in the west an know western ways cabins must be built trails made roads cut well need a head forester for every forest this man must know all thats on his preserve an have it mapped he must teach his rangers what he knows about trees penetier will be given over entirely to the growin of yellow pine thet thrives best an the parasites must go all dead an old timber must be cut an much of thet where the trees are crowded the north slopes must be cut enough to let in the sun an light brush windfalls rottin logs must be burned thickets of young pine must be thinned care oughten be taken not to cut on the north an west edges of the forests as the old guard pines will break the wind  how will you treat miners and prospectors  they must be as free to take up claims as if there wasnt no national forest  how about the settler the man seeking a home out west i went on  well encourage him the more men there are the better the forester can fight fire but those homeseekers must want a home an not be squattin for a little jest to sell out to lumber sharks  whats to become of timber and wood  wal its there to be used an must be used well give it free to the settler an prospector well sell it cheap to the lumbermenbig an little well consider the wants of the local men first  now about the range will you keep out the stockmen  nary grazin for sheep cattle an hosses will go on jest the same but we must look out for overgrazin for instance too many cattle will stamp down young growth an too many sheep leave no grazin for other stock the bead forester must know his business an not let his range be overstocked the small local herders an sheepmen must be considered first the big stockmen second both must be charged a small fee per head for grazin  how will you fight fire  wal thets the hard nut to crack fire is the forests worst enemy in a dry season like this penetier would burn like tinder blown by a bellows fire would race through here faster n a man could run ill need special fire rangers an all other rangers must be trained to fight fire an then any men living in or near the forest will be paid to help the thing to do is watch for the small fires an put them out campers must be made to put out their fires before leaving camp brush piles an slashes mustnt be burned in dry or windy weather  just where we left off talking i could not remember for i dropped off to sleep i seemed hardly to have closed my eyes when the hunter called me in the morning the breakfast was smoking on the redhot coals and outside the cabin all was dense gray fog  when soon after we started down the canyon the fog was lifting and the forest growing lighter everything was as white with frost as if it had snowed a thin brittle frost crackled under our feet when we had gotten below the rocky confines of the canyon we climbed the slope to the level ridge here it was impossible not to believe it had snowed the forest was as still as night and looked very strange with the white aisles lined by black tree trunks and the gray fog shrouding the treetops soon we were climbing again and i saw that hiram meant to head the canyon where i had left dick  the fog split and blew away and the brilliant sunlight changed the forest the frost began to melt and the air was full of mist we climbed and climbedout of the stately yellowpine zone up among the gnarled and blasted spruces over and around strips of weathered stone once i saw a cold white snowpeak it was hard enough for me to carry my rifle and keep up with the hunter without talking besides hiram had answered me rather shortly and i thought it best to keep silent from time to time he stopped to listen then when he turned to go down the slope be trod carefully and cautioned me not to loosen stones and he went slower and yet slower from this i made sure we were not far from the springhole  thars the canyon he whispered stopping to point below where a black irregular line marked the gorge i havent heerd a thing an were close mebbe theyre asleep mebbe most of them are trallin you an i hope so now dont you put your hand or foot on anythin thetll make a noise  then he slipped off and it was wonderful to see how noiselessly he stepped and how he moved between trees and dead branches without a sound i managed pretty well yet more than once a rattling stone or a broken branch stopped hiram short and made him lift a warning hand  at last we got down to the narrow bench which separated the canyonslope from the deep cut it was level and roughly strewn with boulders here we took to all fours and crawled it was easy to move here without noise for the ground was rocky and hard and there was no brush  suddenly i fairly bumped into the hunter looking up i saw that he had halted only a few feet from the edge of the gorge where i had climbed out in my escape he was listening there was not a sound save the dull roar of rushing water  hiram slid forward a little and rose cautiously to look over i did the same when i saw the cave and the springhole i felt a catch in my throat  but there was not a man in sight dicks captors had broken camp they were gone the only thing left in the gorge to show they had ever been there was a burnedout campfire  theyre gone i whispered  wal it pears so replied hiram an its a move i dont like youngster its you they want leslies no particular use to them theyll have to let him go sooner or later if they haint already  whatll we do now  make tracks well cut back acrost the ridge an git some blankets an grub then light out for the other side of penetier  i thought the old hunter had made rapid time on our way up but now i saw what he really meant by making tracks fortunately after a short killing climb the return was all downhill one stride of hirams equalled two of mine and he made his faster so that i had to trot now and then to catch up very soon i was as hot as fire and every step was an effort but i kept thinking of dick of my mustang and outfit and i vowed i would stick to hiram bents trail till i dropped for the matter of that i did drop more than once before we reached the cabin  a short rest while hiram was packing a few things put me right again i strapped my rifle over my shoulder and then went out to untie my bear cub it would have cost me a great deal to leave him behind i knew i ought to still i could not bring myself to it all my life i had wanted a bear cub here was one that i had helped to lasso and tie up with my own hands i made up my mind to hold to the cub until the last gasp  so i walked up to cubby with a manner more bold than sincere he had not eaten anything but he had drunk the water we had left for him to my surprise he made no fuss when i untied the rope on the other hand he seemed to look pleased and i thought i detected a cunning gleam in his little eyes he paddled away down the canyon and as this was in the direction we wanted to go i gave him slack rope and followed  wal youre goin to have a right pert time youngster an dont you forget it said hiram bent  the truth of that was very soon in evidence cubby would not let well enough alone and he would not have a slack rope i think he wanted to choke himself or pull my arms out when i realized that cubby was three times as strong as i was i began to see that my work was cut out for me the more however that he jerked me and hauled me along the more i determined to hang on i thought i had a genuine love for him up to the time he had almost knocked my head off but it was funny how easily he roused my anger after that what would have happened had he taken a notion to go through the brush luckily he kept to the trail which certainly was rough enough so with watching the cub and keeping my feet free of roots and rocks i had no chance to look ahead still i had no concern about this for the old hunter was at my heels and i knew he would keep a sharp lookout  before i was aware of it we had gotten out of the narrow canyon into a valley with welltimbered bottom and open slow rising slopes we were getting down into penetier cubby swerved from the trail and started up the left slope i did not want to go but i had to keep with him and that was the only way the hunter strode behind without speaking and so i gathered that the direction suited him by leaning back on the rope i walked up the slope as easily as if it were a moving stairway cubby pulled me up i had only to move my feet when we reached a level once more i discovered that the cub was growing stronger and wanted to go faster we zigzagged across the ridge to the next canyon which at a glance i saw was deep and steep  thetll be some work goin down that called hiram let me pack your gun  i would have been glad to give it to him but how was i to manage i could not let go of the rope and hiram laden as he was could not catch up with me then suddenly it was too late for cubby lunged forward and down  this first downward jump was not viciousonly a playful one perhaps by way of initiating me but it upset me and i was dragged in the pineneedles i did not leap to my feet i was jerked up then began a wild chase down that steep bushy slope cubby got going and i could no more have checked him than i could a steamengine very soon i saw that not only was the bear cub running away but he was running away with me i slid down yellow places where the earth was exposed i tore through thickets i dodged a thousand trees in some grassy descents it was as if i had sevenleague boots i must have broken all records for jumps all at once i stumbled just as cubby made a spurt and flew forward alighting face downward i dug up the pineneedles with my outstretched hands i scraped with my face and ploughed with my nose i ate the dust and when i brought up with a jolt against a log a more furious boy than ken ward it would be bard to imagine leaping up i strove with every ounce of might to hold in the bear but though fury lent me new strength he kept the advantage  presently i saw the bottom of the canyon an open glade and an old logcabin i looked back to see if the hunter was coming he was not in sight but i fancied i heard him then cubby putting on extra steam took the remaining rods of the slope in another spurt i had to race then fly and at last lost my footing and plunged down into a thicket  there farther progress stopped for both of us cubby had gone down on one side of a sapling and i on the other with the result that we were brought up short i crashed through some low bushes and bumped squarely into the cub whether it was his frantic effort to escape or just excitement or deliberate intention to beat me into a jelly i had no means to tell the fact was he began to dig at me and paw me and maul me never had i been so angry i began to fight back to punch and kick him  suddenly with a crashing in the bushes the cub was hauled away from me and then i saw hiram at the rope  wal wal he ejaculated your own mother wouldnt own you now then he laughed heartily and chuckled to himself and gave the cub a couple of jerks that took the mischief out of him i dragged myself after hiram into the glade the cabin was large and very old and part of the roof was sunken in  well hang up here an camp said hiram this is an old hunters cabin an kinder out of the way well hitch this little fighter inside where mebbe he wont be so noisy  the hunter hauled the cub up short and half pulled half lifted him into the door i took off my rifle emptied my pockets of brush and beat out the dust and combed the pineneedles from my hair my hands were puffed and red and smarted severely and altogether i was in no amiable frame of mind as regarded my captive bear cub  when i stepped inside the cabin it was dark and coming from the bright light i could not for a moment see what the interior looked like presently i made out one large room with no opening except the door there was a tumbledown stone fireplace at one end and at the other a rude ladder led up to a loft hiram had thrown his pack aside and had tied cubby to a peg in the log wall  wal ill fetch in some fresh venison said the hunter you rest awhile an then gather some wood an make a fire  the rest i certainly needed for i was so tired i could scarcely untie the pack to get out the blankets the bear cub showed signs or weariness which pleased me it was not long after hirams departure that i sank into a doze  when my eyes opened i knew i had been awakened by something but i could not tell what i listened cubby was as quiet as a mouse and his very quiet and the alert way he held his ears gave me a vague alarm he had heard something i thought of the old hunters return yet this did not reassure me  all at once the voices of men made me sit up with a violent start who could they be had hiram met a ranger i began to shake a little and was about to creep to the door when i heard the clink of stirrups and soft thud of hoofs then followed more voices and last a loud volley of curses  herkyjerky i gasped and looked about wildly  i had no time to dash out of the door i was caught in a trap and i felt cold and sick suddenly i caught sight of the ladder leading to the loft like a monkey i ran up and crawled as noiselessly as possible upon the rickety flooring of dry pine branches then i lay there quivering     xiv a prisoner  it chanced that as i lay on my side my eye caught a gleam of light through a little ragged hole in the matting of pine branches part of the interior of the cabin the doorway and some space outside were plainly visible the thud of horses had given place to snorts and then came a flopping of saddles and packs on the ground any water hyar asked a gruff voice i recognized as bills spring right thar replied a voice i knew to be buds  you onery old cayuse stand still  from that i gathered herky was taking the saddle off his horse  here leslie ill untie youif youll promise not to bolt  that voice was buells i would have known it among a thousand and dick was still a prisoner  bolt if you let me loose ill beat your fat head off replied dick ha a lot you care about my sore wrists youre weakening buell and you know it youve got a yellow streak  shet up said herky in a low sharp tone a silence followed buell look hyar in the trail tracks goin in an comin out  how old are they  ill bet a hoss they aint an hour old  somebodys usin the cabin eh  the men then fell to whispering and i could not understand what was said but i fancied they were thinking only of me my mind worked fast buell and his fellows had surely not run across hiram bent had the old hunter deserted me i flouted such a thought it was next to a certainty that he had seen the lumbermen and for reasons best known to himself had not returned to the cabin but he was out there somewhere among the pines and i did not think any of those ruffians was safe  then i heard stealthy footsteps approaching soon i saw the mexican slipping cautiously to the door he peeped within probably the interior was dark to him as it had been to me he was not a coward for he stepped inside  at that instant there was a clinking sound a rush and a roar and a black mass appeared to hurl itself upon the mexican he went down with a piercing shriek then began a fearful commotion screams and roars mingled with the noise of combat i saw a whirling cloud of dust on the cabin floor the cub had jumped on the mexican what an unmerciful beating he was giving that greaser i could have yelled out in my glee i had to bite my tongue to keep from urging on my docile little pet bear greaser surely thought he had fallen in with his evil spirit for he howled to the saints to save him  herkyjerky was the only one of his companions brave enough to start to help him  the cabins full of bars he yelled  at his cry the bear leaped out of the cloud of dust and shot across the threshold like black lightning in his onslaught upon greaser he had broken his halter herkyjerky stood directly in his path i caught only a glimpse but it served to show that herky was badly scared the cub dove at herky under him straight between his legs like a greased pig and spilling him all over the trail sped on out of sight herky raised himself and then he sat there red as a lobster and bawled curses while he made his huge revolver spurt flame on flame  i could not see the other men but their uproarious mirth could have been heard half a mile away when it dawned upon herky he was so furious that he spat at them like an angry cat and clicked his empty revolver  then greaser lurched out of the door i got a glimpse of him and for a wonder was actually sorry for him he looked as if he had been through a threshingmachine  haw haw ho ho roared the merry lumbermen  then they trooped into the cabin buell headed the line and herky sullenly reloading his revolver came last at first they groped around in the dim light stumbling over everything part of the time they were in the light space near the door and the rest i could not see them i scarcely dared to breathe i felt a creepy chill and my eyesight grew dim  who does this stuff belong to anyhow buell was saying an what was thet bear doin in here  he was roped uphyars the hitch answered bud  an hyars a riflewinchesteraint been used much buell its thet kids  i heard rapid footsteps and smothered exclamations  take it from me youre right ejaculated buell we jest missed him herky them tracks out there somebodys with this boywho  its jim williams put in dick leslie coolvoiced and threatening  the little stillness that followed his words was broken by buell  naw twasnt williams you cant bluff this bunch leslie by your own words williams is lookin for us an if hes lookin for anybody i know hes lookin for em see  buell the kids fell in with old bent the bar hunter said bill thet accounts fer the

williams and then you fellows will be up against it theres going to be somebody killed the best thing for you to do is to let me go and then cut out yourself  buell breathed as heavily as a porpoise and his footsteps pounded hard  leslie im seein this outunderstand when bud rode down to the mill an told me the kid had got away i made up my mind to ketch him an shet his mouthone way or another an ill do it take thet from me  bah sneered dick youre scared into the middle of next week right now besides if you do ketch ken it wont do you any goodnow  what  but dick shut up like a clam and not

didnt hear them shots of herkys he may come back lets wait awhile an if he doesnt come put herky on the trail  good greaser go out an hide the hossesdrive them up the canyon  the mexican shuffled out and all the others settled down to quiet i heard some of them light their pipes bud leaned against the left of the door buell sat on the other side and beyond them i saw as much of herky as his boots i knew him by his bowlegs  the stillness that set in began to be hard on me when the men were moving about and talking i had been so interested that my predicament did not occupy my mind but now with those ruffians waiting silently below i was beset with a thousand fears the very consciousness that i must be quiet made it almost impossible then i became aware that my one position cramped my arm and side a million prickling needles were at my elbow a band as of steel tightened about my breast i grew hot and cold and trembled i knew the slightest move would be fatal so i bent all my mind to lying quiet as a stone  greaser came limping back into the cabin and found a seat without any one speaking it was so still that i heard the silken rustle of paper as he rolled a cigarette moments that seemed long as years passed with my muscles clamped as in a vise if only i had lain down upon my back but there i was half raised on my elbow in a most awkward and uncomfortable position i tried not to mind the tingling in my arm but to think of hiram of jim of my mustang but presently i could not think of anything except the certainty that i would soon lose control of my muscles and fall over  the tingling changed to a painful vibration and perspiration stung my face the strain became unbearable all of a sudden something seemed to break within me and my muscles began to ripple and shake i had no power to stop it more than that the feeling was so terrible that i knew i would welcome discovery as a relief  shssh whispered some one below  i turned my eyes down to the peephole bud had moved over squarely into the light of the door he was bending over something then he extended his hand back uppermost toward buell on the back of that broad brown hand were pieces of leaf and bits of pineneedles the trembling of my body had shaken these from the brush on the rickety loft more than that in the yellow bar of sunlight which streamed in at the door there floated particles of dust  bud silently looked upward there was a gleam in his black eyes and his mouth was agape buells gaze followed buds and his face grew curious intent then fixed in a cunning bold smile of satisfaction he rose to his feet  come down out o thet he ordered harshly come down  the sound of his voice stilled my trembling i did not move nor breathe i saw buell loom up hugely and bud slowly rise herkyjerkys boots suddenly stood on end and i knew then he had also risen the silence which followed buells order was so dense that it oppressed me  come down repeated buell  there was no hint of doubt in his deep voice but a cold certainty and a brutal note i had feared the man before but that gave me new terror  bud climb the ladder commanded buell  i aint stuck on thet job rejoined bud  as his heavy boots thumped on the ladder they jarred the whole cabin my very desperation filled me with the fierceness of a cornered animal i caught sight of a short branch of the thickness of a mans arm and grasping it i slowly raised myself when buds black round head appeared above the loft i hit it with all my might  bud bawled like a wounded animal and fell to the ground with the noise of a load of bricks through my peephole i saw him writhing with both hands pressed to his head then lying flat on his back he whipped out his revolver i saw the red spurt the puff of smoke bang  a bullet zipped through the brush and tore a hole through the roof  bang bang  i felt a hot tearing pain in my arm  stop you black idiot yelled buell he kicked the revolver out of buds hand what dyou mean by thet  in the momentary silence that followed i listened intently even while i held tightly to my arm from its feeling my arm seemed to be shot off but it was only a fleshwound after the first instant of shock i was not scared but blood flowed fast warm oily slippery it ran down inside my shirt sleeve and dripped off my fingers  bud hoarsely spoke up bill breaking the stillness mebbe you killed him  buell coughed as if choking  whats thet for once his deep voice was pitched low listen  drip drip drip it was like the sound of water dripping from a leak in a roof it was directly under me and quick as thought i knew the sound was made by my own dripping blood  find thet somebody ordered buell  drip drip drip  one of the men stepped noisily  hyar it isthar said bill look on my hand blood i knowed it bud got him all right  there was a sudden rustling such as might come from a quick strained movement  buell cried dick leslie in piercing tones heaven help you murdering thieves if that boys killed ill see you strung up right in this forest ken speak speak  it seemed then in my pain and bitterness that i would rather let buell think me dead dicks voice went straight to my heart but i made no answer  leslie i didnt kill him an i didnt order it said buell in a voice strangely shrunk and shaken i meant no harm to the lad go up bud an get him  bud made no move nor did greaser when he was ordered go up somebody an see whats up there shouted buell strikes me you might go yourself said bill coolly  with a growl buell mounted the ladder when his great shock head hove in sight i was seized by a mad desire to give him a little of his own medicine with both hands i lifted the piece of pine branch and brought it down with every ounce of strength in me  like a pistol it cracked on buells head and snapped into bits the lumberman gave a smothered groan then clattered down the ladder and rolled on the floor there he lay quiet  allfired deadthet kidnow aint he said bud sarcastically howd you like thet crack on the knob youll need a larger size hat mebbe herkyjerky you go up an see whats up there  ive a picture of myself goin replied herky without moving  whars the water get some water greaser chimed in bill  from the way they worked over buell i concluded he had been pretty badly stunned but he came to presently  what struck me he asked  oh nothin replied bud derisively the loft up thars full of air an it blowed on you thets all  buell got up and began walking around  bill go out an fetch in some long poles he said  when bill returned with a number of sharp bayonetlike pikes i knew the game was all up for me several of the men began to prod through the thin covering of dry brush one of them reached me and struck so hard that i lurched violently  that was too much for the rickety loft floor it was only a bit of brush laid on a netting of slender poles it creaked rasped and went down with a crash i alighted upon somebody and knocked him to the floor whoever it was seized me with iron hands i was buried almost smothered in the dusty mass my captor began to curse cheerfully and i knew then that herkyjerky had made me a prisoner     xv the fight  herky hauled me out of the brush and held me in the light the others scrambled from under the remains of the loft and all viewed me curiously  kid you aint hurt much queried buell with concern  i would have snapped out a reply but i caught sight of dicks pale face and anxious eyes  ken he called with both gladness and doubt in his voice you look pretty goodbut that blood tell me quick  its nothing dick only a little cut the bullet just ticked my arm  whatever dicks reply was it got drowned in herkyjerkys long explosion of strange language herky was plainly glad i had not been badly hurt i had already heard mirth anger disgust and fear in his outbreaks and now relief was added he stripped off my coat cut off the bloody sleeve of my shirt and washed the wound it was painful and bled freely but it was not much worse than cuts from spikes when playing ball herky bound it tightly with a strip of my shirtsleeve and over that my handkerchief  thar kid thetll stiffen up an be sore fer a day or two but it aint nothin youll soon be bouncin clubs offen our heads  it was plain that herkyand the others for that matter except buellthought more of me because i had wielded a club so vigorously  look at thet lump kid said bud bending his head now aint thet a nice way to treat a feller it made me plumb mad it did  im likely to hurt somebody yet i declared  they looked at me curiously buell raised his face with a queer smile bud broke into a laugh  oh youre goin to mebbe you think you need an axe said he  they made no offer to tie me up then bud went to the door and sat in it and i heard him half whisper to buell what d i tell you thets a game kid if he ever wakes up right well have a wildcat on our hands hell do fer one of us yet these men all took pleasure in saying things like this to buell this time buell had no answer ready and sat nursing his head wal i hev a little headache myself an the crack i got wasnt nothin to yourn concluded bud then bill began packing the supplies indoors and herky started a fire bud kept a sharp eye on me still he made no objection when i walked over and lay down upon the blankets near dick  dick i shot a bear and helped to tie up a cub i said and then i told him all that had happened from the time i scrambled out of the springhole till i was discovered up in the loft dick shook his head as if he did not know what to make of me and all he said was that he would give a years pay to have me safe back in pennsylvania  herkyjerky announced supper in his usual mannera challenge to find as good a cook as he was and a cheerful call to grub i did not know what to think of his kindness to me remembering how he had nearly drowned me in the spring i resented his sudden change he could not do enough for me i asked the reason for my sudden popularity  herky scratched his head and grinned yep kid you sure hev riz in my estimashun  hey you rummy cowpuncher broke in bud scornfully mebbe youd like the kid moren you do if youd got one of them wollops  bud i aint sayin replied herky with his mouth full of meat considerin all points howsoever im thinkin them wallops was distributed very proper  they bandied such talk between them and occasionally bill chimed in with a joke greaser ate in morose silence there must have been something on his mind buell took very little dinner and appeared to be in pain it was dark when the meal ended bud bound me up for the night and he made a good job of it my arm burned and throbbed but not badly enough to prevent sleep twice i had nearly dropped off when loud laughs or voices roused me my eyes closed with a picture of those rough dark men sitting before the fire  a noise like muffled thunder burst into my slumber i awakened with my body cramped and stiff it was daylight and something had happened buell ran in and out of the cabin yelling at his men all of them except herky were wildly excited buell was abusing bud for something and bud was blaming buell  thets no way to talk to me said bud angrily he didnt break loose in my watch  you an greaser had the job both of youwent to sleeptake thet from me  wal hes gone an he took the kids gun with him said bill coolly now well be dodgin bullets  dick leslie had escaped i could hardly keep down a cry of triumph i did ask if it was true but none of them paid any attention to me buell then ordered herkyjerky to trail dick and see where he had gone herky refused pointblank nope not fer me he said leslie has a rifle so has bent an we havent one among us an buell if leslie falls in with bent its goin to git hot fer us round here  this silenced buell but did not stop his restless pacings his face was like a thundercloud and he was plainly worried and harassed once bud deliberately asked what he intended to do with me and buell snarled a reply which no one understood his gloom extended to the others except herky who whistled and sang as he busied himself about the campfire greaser appeared to be particularly cast down  buell what are you going to do with me i demanded but he made no answer  well anyway i went on somebody cut these ropes im mighty sore and uncomfortable  herkyjerky did not wait for permission he untied me and helped me to my feet i was rather unsteady on my legs at first and my injured arm felt like a board it seemed dead but after i had moved it a little the pain came back and it had apparently come to stay we ate breakfast and then settled down to do nothing or to wait for something to turn up buell sat in the doorway moodily watching the trail once he spoke ordering the mexican to drive in the horses i fancied from this that buell might have decided to break camp but there was no move to pack  the morning quiet was suddenly split by the stinging crack of a rifle and a yell of agony  buell leaped to his feet his ruddy face white  greaser he exclaimed  thet was about where greaser cashed relied bill coolly knocking the ashes from his pipe  no bill youre wrong here comes greaser runnin like an indian  look at the blood hes been plugged all right exclaimed herkyjerky  the sound of running feet drew nearer and suddenly the group at the door broke to admit the mexican one side of his terrified face was covered with blood his eyes were staring his hands raised he staggered as if about to fall  senyor william senyor william he cried and then called on saint somebody  jim williams i said so muttered bud  bill caught hold of the excited mexican and pulled him nearer the light  thet aint a bad hurt jest cut his ear off aid bill hyar stand still you wild man youre not goin to die git some water herky fellers greaser has been oneasy ever since he knew jim williams was lookin fer him he thinks jim did this but jim williams dont use a rifle an whats more when he shoots he dont miss you all heerd the rifleshot  then it was old bent or leslie questioned buell  leslie it were bent uses a 4590 caliber thet shot we heerd was from the little 38the kids gun  wal it was a narrer escape fer greaser said bud leslies sore an hell shoot fer keeps buell youve started somethin  when bill had washed the blood off the mexican it was found that the ball had carried away the lower part of the ear and with it of course the gold earring the wound must have been extremely painful it certainly took all the starch out of greaser he kept mumbling in his own language and rolling his wicked black eyes and twisting his thin yellow hands  whats to be done asked buell sharply  thets fer you to say replied bill with his exasperating calmness  must we hang up here to be shot at leslies takin a long chance on thet kids life if he comes slingin lead round this cabin  herkyjerky spat tobaccojuice across the room and grunted then with his beady little eyes as keen and cold as flint he said buell leslie knows you darent harm the kid an as fer bullets hell take good care where he stings em this deal of ours begins to look like a wildgoose stunt it never was safe an now its worse  here was even herkyjerky harping on buells situation to me it did not appear much more serious than before but evidently they thought buell seemed on the verge of losing control of himself he glared at herky and rammed his fists in his pockets and paced the long room presently he stepped out of the door  a rifle cracked clear and sharp another bellowed out heavy and hollow a bullet struck the doorpost a second hummed through the door and budded into the log wall buell jumped back into the room his face worked his breath hissed between his teeth as with trembling hand he examined the front of his coat a big bullet had torn through both lapels  bill stuck his pudgy finger in the hole the second bullet made thet it was from old hirams guna 4590  bent an leslie my god theyre shootin to kill cried buell  i should smile replied herkyjerky  bud was peeping out through a chink between the logs i got their smoke he said look bill up the slope theyre too fur off but we may as well send up respects with that he aimed his revolver through the narrow crack and deliberately shot six times the reports clapped like thunder the smoke from burnt powder and the smell of brimstone filled the room by way of reply old hirams rifle boomed out twice and two heavy slugs crashed through the roof sending down a shower of dust and bits of decayed wood  thets jist to show what a 4590 can do remarked bill  bud reloaded his weapon while bill shot several times herkyjerky had his gun in hand but contented himself with peering from different chinks between the logs i hid behind the wide stone fireplace and though i felt pretty safe from flying bullets i began to feel the icy grip of fear i had seen too much of these men in excitement and knew if circumstances so brought it about there might come a moment when my life would not be worth a pin they were all sober now and deadly quiet buell showed the greatest alarm though he had begun to settle down to what looked like fight herky was more fearless than any of them and cooler even than bill all at once i missed the mexican if he had not slipped out of the room he had hidden under the brush of the fallen loft or in a pile of blankets but the room was smoky and it was hard for me to be certain  some time passed with no shots and with no movement inside the cabin slowly the blue smoke wafted out of the door the sunlight danced in gleams through the holes in the ragged roof there was a pleasant swish of pine branches against the cabin  listen whispered bud hoarsely i heerd a pony snort  then the rapid beat of hard hoofs on the trail was followed by several shots from the hillside soon the clatter of hoofs died away in the distance  who was thet asked three of buells men in unison  take it from me greasers sneaked replied buell  howd he git out  with that bud and bill began kicking in the piles of brush  aha hyars the place sang out bud  in one corner of the back wall a rotten log had crumbled and here it was plain to all eyes that greaser had slipped out i remembered that on this side of the cabin there was quite a thick growth of young pine greaser had been able to conceal himself as he crawled toward the horses and had probably been seen at the last moment herkyjerky was the only one to make comment  i aint wishin greaser any hard luck but hope he carried away a couple of 4590 slugs somewheres in his yaller carcass  itd be worth a lot to the feller who can show me a way out of this mess said buell mopping the beads of sweat from his face  i got upit seemed to me my mind was made up for meand walked into the light of the room  buell i can show you the way i said quietly  what his mouth opened in astonishment speak up then  the other men stepped forward and i felt their eyes upon me  let me go free let me out of here to find dick leslie then when you go to jail in holston for stealing lumber ill say a good word for you and your men there wont be any charge of kidnapping or violence  after a long pause during which buell bored me with gimlet eyes he said in a queer voice say thet again  i repeated it and added that he could not gain anything now by holding me a prisoner i think he saw what i meant but hated to believe it  its too late i said as he hesitated  you mean leslie lied an you fooled meyou did get to holston he shouted he was quivering with rage and the red flamed in his neck and face  buell i did get to holston and i did send word to washington i went on hurriedly for i had begun to lose my calmness i wrote to my father he knows a friend of the chief forester who is close to the department at washington by this time holston is full of officers of the forest service perhaps theyre already at your mill anyway the games up and youd better let me go  buells face lost all its ruddy color slowly blanched and changed terribly the boldness fled leaving it craven almost ghastly realizing he had more to fear from the law than conviction of his latest lumber steal he made at me in blind anger  hold on herkyjerky yelled as he jumped between buell and me  buells breath was a hiss and the words he bit between his clinched teeth were unintelligible in that moment he would have killed me  herkyjerky met his onslaught and flung him back then with his hand on the butt of his revolver he spoke  buell hyars where you an me split youve bungled your big deal the kid stacked the deck on you but i aint agoin to see you do him harm fer it  herkys right boss put in bill thars no sense in addin murder to this mess strikes me youre in bad enough  so thets your game youre doublecrossin me nowall on a chance at kidnappin for ransom money well im through with the kid an all of you take thet from me  you skunk exclaimed herkyjerky with the utmost cheerfulness  wal buell said bill in cool disdain comsiderin my fondness fer fresh air an open country i cant say im sorry to dissolve future relashuns i was only in jail onct an i couldnt breathe free  it was then buell went beside himself with rage he raised his huge fists and shook himself and plunged about the room cursing suddenly he picked up an axe and began chopping at the rotten log above the hole where greaser had slipped out bud yelled at him so did bill herkyjerky said unpleasant things but buell did not hear them he hacked and dug away like one possessed the dull sodden blows fell fast scattering pieces of wood about the floor the madness that was in buell was the madness to get out to escape the consequences of his acts his grunts and pants as he worked showed his desperate energy then he slammed the axe against the wall and going down flat began to crawl through the opening buell was a thick man and the hole appeared too small he stuck in it but he squeezed and flattened himself finally worked through and disappeared  a sudden quiet fell upon his departure  hands up  jim williamss voice it was strange to see herky and bud flash up their arms without turning but i wheeled quickly bill too had his hands high in the air  in the sunlight of the doorway stood jim williams low down carelessly it seemed he held two long revolvers he looked the same easy slow texan i remembered but the smile was not now in his eyes and his lips were set in a thin hard line     xvi the forests greatest foe  jim williams sent out a sharp call from the canyonslope came answering shouts there were sounds of heavy bodies breaking through brush followed by the thudding of feet then men could be plainly heard running up the trail jim leaned against the doorpost and the three fellows before him stood rigid as stone  suddenly a form leaped past jim it was dick leslie bareheaded his hair standing like a lions mane and he had a cocked rifle in his hands close behind him came old hiram bent slower more cautious but no less formidable as these men glanced around with fiery eyes the quick look of relief that shot across their faces told of ungrounded fears  wheres buell sharply queried dick  jim williams did not reply and a momentary silence ensued  buell lit out after the greaser said bill finally  cut and run did he thats his speed grimly said dick here bent find some rope weve got to tie up these jacks  hands back an be graceful like quick sang out jim williams  it seemed to me human beings could not have more eagerly and swiftly obeyed an order herky and bill and bud jerked their arms down and extended their hands out behind after that quick action they again turned into statues there was a breathless suspense in every act and there was something about jim williams then that i did not like i was in a cold perspiration for fear one of the men would make some kind of a move as the very mention of the texan had always caused a little silence so his presence changed the atmosphere of that cabin room before his coming there had been the element of chancea feeling of danger to be sure but a healthy spirit of give and take that had all changed with jim williamss words hands up there was now something terrible hanging in the balance i had but to look at jims eyes narrow slits of blue fire at the hard jaw and tight lips to see a glimpse of the man who thought nothing of life it turned me sick and i was all in a tremor till dick and hiram had the men bound fast  then jim dropped the long blue guns into the holsters on his belt  ken i shore am glad to see you said he  the soft drawling voice the sleepy smile the careless goodwill all came back utterly transforming the man this was the jim williams i had come to love with a wrench i recovered myself  are you all right ken asked dick and old hiram questioned me with a worried look this anxiety marked the difference between these men and williams i hastened to assure my friends that i was none the worse for my captivity  ken your little gun doesnt shoot where it points said jim i shore had a bead on the greaser an missed him first greaser i ever missed  you shot his ear off i replied he came running back covered with blood i never saw a man so scared  wal i shore am glad drawled jim  he made off with your mustang said dick  this information lessened my gladness at greasers escape still i would rather have had him get away on my horse than stay to be shot by jim  dick called me to go outside with him my pack was lying under one of the pines near the cabin and examination proved that nothing had been disturbed we found the horses grazing up the canyon buell had taken the horse of one of his men and had left his own superb bay most likely he had jumped astride the first animal he saw dick said i could have buells splendid horse i had some trouble in catching him as he was restive and spirited but i succeeded eventually and we drove the other horses and ponies into the glade my comrades then fell to arguing about what to do with the prisoners dick was for packing them off to holston bent talked against this saying it was no easy matter to drive bound men over rough trails and jim sided with him  once while they were talking i happened to catch herkyjerkys eye he was lying on his back in the light from the door herky winked at me screwed up his face in the most astonishing manner all of which i presently made out to mean that he wanted to speak to me so i went over to him  kid you aint agoin to fergit i stalled off buell whispered herky hed hev done fer you an thets no lie you wont fergit when were rustled down to holston  ill remember herky i promised and i meant to put in a good word for him because whether or not his reasons had to do with kidnapping and ransom he had saved me from terrible violence perhaps death  it was decided that we would leave the prisoners in the cabin and ride down to the sawmill hiram was to return at once with officers if none could be found at the mill he was to guard the prisoners and take care of them till dick could send officers to relieve him thereupon we cooked a meal and i was put to feeding herky and his companions dick ordered me especially to make them drink water as it might be a day or longer before hiram could get back i made bill drink and easily filled up herky but bud who never drank anything save whiskey gave me a job he refused with a growl and i insisted with what i felt sure was christian patience still he would not drink so i put the cup to his lips and tipped it bud promptly spat the water all over me and i as promptly got another cupful and dashed it all over him  bud youll drink or ill drown you i declared  so while bill cracked hoarse jokes and herky swore his pleasure i made bud drink all he could hold jim got a good deal of fun out of it but dick and hiram never cracked a smile possibly the latter two saw something far from funny in the outlook at any rate they were silent almost moody and in a hurry to be off  dick was so anxious to be on the trail that he helped me pack my pony and saddled buells horse it was one thing to admire the big bay from the ground and it was another to be astride him targetthat was his namehad a spirited temper an iron mouth and he had been used to a sterner hand than mine he danced all over the glade before he decided to behave himself riding him however was such a great pleasure that a more timid boy than i would have taken the risk he would not let any horse stay near him he pulled on the bridle and leaped whenever a branch brushed him i had been on some good horses but never on one with a swing like his and i grew more and more possessed with the desire to let him run  like as not hell bolt with you hold him in ken called dick as he mounted then he shouted a final word to the prisoners saying they would be looked after and drove the packponies into the trail as we rode out we passed several of the horses that we had decided to leave behind and as they wanted to follow us it was necessary to drive them back  i had my hands full with the big steeljawed steed i was trying to hold in it was the hardest work of the kind that i had ever undertaken i had never worn spurs but now i began to wish for them we traveled at a good clip as fast as the packponies could go and covered a long distance by campingtime i was surprised that we did not get out of the canyon the place where we camped was a bare rocky opening with a big pool in the center while we were making camp it suddenly came over me that i was completely bewildered as to our whereabouts i could not see the mountain peaks and did not know one direction from another even when jim struck out of our trail and went off alone toward holston i could not form an idea of where i was all this however added to my feeling of the bigness of penetier  dick was taciturn and old hiram when i tried to engage him in conversation cut me off with the remark that i would need my breath on the morrow this somewhat offended me so i made my bed and rolled into it not till i had lain quiet for a little did i realize that every bone and muscle felt utterly worn out i seemed to deaden and stiffen more each moment presently dick breathed heavily and hiram snored the red glow of fire paled and died i heard the clinking of the hobbles on target and a step now and then of the other horses the sky grew ever bluer and colder the stars brighter and larger and the night wind moaned in the pines i heard a coyote bark a trout splash in the pool and the hoot of an owl then the sounds and the clear cold night seemed to fade away  when dick roused me the forest was shrouded in gray cold fog no time was lost in getting breakfast driving in the horses and packing hardly any words were exchanged my comrades appeared even soberer than on the day before the fog lifted quickly that morning and soon the sun was shining  we got under way at once and took to the trail at a jogtrot i knew my horse better and he was more used to me which made it at least bearable to both of us before long the canyon widened out into the level forest land thickly studded with magnificent pines i had again the feeling of awe and littleness everything was solemn and still the morning air was cool and dry as toast the smell of pitchpine choked my nostrils we rode briskly down the broad brown aisles across the sunny glades under the murmuring pines  the old hunter was leading our train and evidently knew perfectly what he was about unexpectedly he halted bringing us up short the packponies lined up behind us hiram looked at dick  i smell smoke he said sniffing at the fragrant air  dick stared at the old hunter and likewise sniffed i followed their lead but all i could smell was the thick piney odor of the forest  i dont catch it replied dick  we continued on our journey perhaps for a quarter of a mile and then hiram bent stopped again this time he looked significantly at dick without speaking a word  ah exclaimed dick i thought his tone sounded queer but it did not at the moment strike me forcibly we rode on the forest became lighter glimpses of sky showed low down through the trees we were nearing a slope  for the third time the old hunter brought us to a stop this time on the edge of a slope that led down to the rolling foothills i could only stand and gaze those open stretches sloping down all green and brown and beautiful robbed me of thought  look thar cried hiram bent  his tone startled me i faced about to see his powerful arm outstretched and his finger pointing his stern face added to my sudden concern something was wrong with my friends i glanced in the direction he indicated there were two rolling slopes or steps below us and they were like gigantic swells of a green ocean beyond the second one rose a long billowy bluish cloud it was smoke all at once i smelled smoke too it came on the fresh strong wind  forest fire exclaimed dick  wal i reckon replied hiram tersely an look thar an thar  far to the right and far to the left over the green swelling foothills rose that rounded changing line of blue cloud  the slash the slash buells fired the slash cried dick as one suddenly awakened penetier will go  wal i reckon but thets not the worst  you mean  mebbe we cant get out the forests dry as powder an thets the worst wind we could have these canyondraws suck in the wind an fire will race up them fast as a hoss can run  good god man whatll we do  wait mebbe it aint so badyet now lets all listen  the faces of my friends more than words terrified me i listened with all my ears while watching with all my eyes the line of rolling cloud expanded seemed to burst and roll upward to bulge and mushroom in a few short moments it covered the second slope as far to the right and left as we could see the under surface was a bluish white it shot up swiftly to spread out into immense slowmoving clouds of creamy yellow  hear thet hiram bent shook his gray head as one who listened to dire tidings  the wind sweeping up the slope of penetier carried a strong pungent odor of burning pitch it brought also a low roar not like the wind in the trees or rapidrushing water it might have been my imagination but i fancied it was like the sound of flames blowing through the wood of a campfire  fire fire exclaimed hiram with another ominous shake of his head we must be up an doin  the forests greatest foe old penetier is doomed cried dick leslie that line of fire is miles long and is spreading fast itll shoot up the canyons and crisscross the forest in no time bent whatll we do  mebbe we can get around the line we must or well have to make tracks for the mountain an thets a long chance you take to the left an ill go to the right an well see how the fires runnin  what will ken do  wal let him stay hereno thet wont do we might get driven back a little an have to circle the safest place in this forest is where we camped thets not far let him drive the ponies back thar an wait  all right ken you hustle the packteam back to our last nights camp wait there for us we wont be long  dick galloped off through the forest and hiram went down the slope in almost the opposite direction left alone i turned my horse and drove the packponies along our backtrail thus engaged i began to recover somewhat from the terror that had stupefied me still i kept looking back i found the mouth of the canyon and the trail and in what i thought a very short time i reached the bare rocky spot where we had last camped the horses all drank thirstily and i discovered that i was hot and dry  then i waited at every glance i expected to see dick and hiram riding up the canyon but moments dragged by and they did not come here there was no sign of smoke nor even the faintest hint of the roar of the fire the wind blew strongly up the canyon and i kept turning my ear to it in spite of the fact that my friends did not come quickly i had begun to calm my fears they would return presently with knowledge of the course of the fire and the way to avoid it my thoughts were mostly occupied with sorrow for beautiful penetier what a fiend buell was i had heard him say he would fire the slash and he had kept his word  half an hour passed i saw a flash of gray down the canyon and shouted in joy but what i thought dick and hiram was a herd of deer they were running wildly they clicked on the stones and scarcely swerved for the packponies it took no second glance to see that they were fleeing from the fire this brought back all my alarms and every moment that i waited thereafter added to them i watched the trail and under the trees for my friends and i scanned the sky for signs of the bluewhite clouds of smoke but i saw neither  dick told me to wait here but how long shall i wait i muttered somethings happened to him if only i could see what that fire is doing  the campingplace was low down between two slopes one of which was high and had a rocky cliff standing bare in the sunlight i conceived the idea of climbing to it i could not sit quietly waiting any longer so mounting target i put him up the slope it was not a steep climb still it was long and took considerable time before i reached the gray cliff i looked down over the forest to see the rolling smoky clouds we climbed higher and still higher till target reached the cliff and could go no farther leaping off i tied him securely and bent my efforts to getting around on top of the cliff if i had known what a climb it was i should not have attempted it but i could not back out with the summit looming over me it ran up to a ragged crag hot exhausted and out of breath i at last got there  as i looked i shouted in surprise it seemed that the whole of penetier was under my feet the green slope disappeared in murky clouds of smoke there were great pillars and huge banks of yellow and long streaks of black and here and there underneath moving splashes of red the thing did not stay still one instant it changed so that i could not tell what it did look like them were life and movement in it and something terribly sinister i tried to calculate how far distant the fire was and how fast it was coming but that in my state of mind i could not do the whole sweep of forest below me was burning i felt the strong breeze and smelled the burnt wood puffs of white smoke ran out ahead of the main clouds and i saw three of them widely separated what they meant puzzled me but all of a sudden i saw in front of the nearest a flickering gleam of red then i knew those white streams of smoke rose where the fire was being sucked up the canyons they leaped along with amazing speed it was then that i realized that dick and hiram had been caught by one of these offshoots of the fire and had been compelled to turn away to save their lives perhaps they would both be lost for a moment i felt faint but i fought it off i had to think of myself it was every one for himself and perhaps there was many a man caught on penetier with only a slender chance for life  oh oh i cried suddenly herky bud and bill tied helpless in that cabin dick forgot them theyll be burned to death  as i stood there trembling at the thought of herky and his comrades bound hand and foot the first roar of the forest fire reached my ears it threatened but it roused my courage i jumped as if i had been shot and clattered down that crag with wings guiding my long leaps no crevice or jumble of loose stones or steep descent daunted me i reached the horse and grasping the bridle i started to lead him we had zigzagged up we went straight down target was too spirited to balk but he did everything else more than once he reared with his hoofs high in the air and snorting crashed down he pulled me off my feet he pawed at me with his great iron shoes when we got clear of the roughest and most thickly overgrown part of the descent i mounted him then i needed no longer to urge him the fire had entered the canyon the hollow roar swept up and filled target with the same fright that possessed me he plunged down slid on his haunches jumped the logs crashed through brush i had continually to rein him toward the camp he wanted to turn from that hot wind and strange roar  we reached a level the open stony ground then the pool the packponies were standing patiently with drooping heads the sun was obscured in thin blue haze smoke and dust and ashes blew by with the wind i put targets nose down to the water so that he would drink then i cut packs off the ponies spilled the contents and filled my pockets with whatever i could lay my hands on in the way of eatables i hung a canteen on the pommel and threw a bag of biscuits over the saddle and tied it fast my fingers worked swiftly there was a fluttering in my throat and my sight was dim all the time the roar of the forest fire grew louder and more ominous  the ponies would be safe i would be safe in the lee of the big rocks near the pool but i did not mean to stay i could not stay with those men lying tied up in the cabin herky had saved me still it was not that which spurred me on  target snorted shrilly and started back from the water ready to stampede slipping the bridle into place i snapped the bit between his teeth i had to swing off my feet to pull his head down  even as i did this i felt the force of the wind it was hard to breathe a white tumbling column of smoke hid sky and sun all about me it was like a blue twilight  the appalling roar held me spellbound with my foot in the stirrup it drew my glance even in that moment of flight  under the shifting cloud flashes of red followed by waves of fire raced through the treetops that the forest fire traveled through the treetops was as new to me as it was terrible the fire seemed to make and drive the wind lower down along the ground was a dull furnaceglow now dark now bright it all brought into my mind a picture i had seen of the end of the world  target broke the spell by swinging me up into the saddle as he leaped forward with a furious snort i struck him with the bridle and yelled  you ironjawed brute youve been crazy to runnow run     xvii the backfire  target pounded over the scaly ground and thundered into the hard trail then he stretched out as we cleared the last obstructing pile of rocks i looked back there was a vast wave of fire rolling up the canyon and spreading up the slopes it was so close that i nearly fainted with both hands knotted and stiff i clung to the pommel in a cold horror and i looked back no more to see the flames reaching out for me but i could not keep the dreadful roar from filling my ears and it weakened me so that i all but dropped from the saddle only an unconscious instinct to fight for life made me hold on  blue and white puffs of smoke swept by me the trail was a dim twisting line the slopes and pines merged in a mass flew backward in brown sheets above the roar of the pursuing fire i heard the thunder of targets hoofs i scarcely felt him or the saddle only a motion and the splitting of the wind  the fear of death by fire which had almost robbed me of strength passed from me my brain cleared still i had no kind of hope only a desperate resolve not to give up  the great bay horse was running to save his life and to save mine it was a race with fire when i thought of the horse and saw how fast he was going and realized that i must do my part i was myself again  the trail was a winding hardpacked thread of white ground it had been made for leisurely travel many turns were sudden and sharp i loosened the reins and cried out to target evidently i had unknowingly held him in for he lengthened out and went on in quicker longer leaps in that moment riding seemed easy i listened to the roar behind me now a little less deafening and began to thrill we were running away from the fire  hope made the race seem different something stirred and beat warm within me driving out the chill in my marrow i leaned over the neck of the great bay horse and called to him and cheered him on then i saw he was deaf and blind to me for he was wild he had the bit between his teeth and was running away  the roar behind us relentlessly pursuing only a little less appalling was now not my only source of peril target could no more be guided nor stopped than could the forest fire the trail grew more winding and overhung more thickly by pine branches the horse did not swerve an inch for tree or thicket but ran as if free and the saving of my life began to be a matter of dodging once a crashing blow from a branch almost knocked me from the saddle the wind in my ears half drowned the roar behind me with hands twisted in targets mane i bent low watching with keen eyes for the trees and branches ahead i drew up my knees and bent my body and dodged and went down flat over the pommel like a wildriding indian target kept that straining run for a longer distance than i could judge with the same breakneck speed he thundered on over logs and little washes through the thick bordering bushes and around the sudden turns his foam moistened my face and flecked my sleeves the wind came stinging into my face the heavy roar followed at my back with its menace  swift and terrible as the forest fire was target was winning the race i knew it steadily the roar softened but it did not die away pound pound pound the big bay charged up the trail how long could he stand that killing pace i began to talk soothingly to him to pull on the bridle but he might have been an avalanche for all he heeded still i kept at him fighting him every moment that i was free from low branches gradually the strain began to tell  the sight of a cabin brought back to my mind the meaning of the wild race with fire i had forgotten the prisoners i had reached the forest glade and the cabin but target was still going hard what if i could not stop him summoning all my strength i quickly threw weight and muscle back on the reins and snapped the bit out of his teeth then coaxing commanding i pulled him back in the glade were four horses standing bunched with heads and ears up uneasy and beginning to be frightened perhaps the sight of them helped me to stop target at any rate he slackened his pace and halted he was spotted with foam dripping wet and his broad sides heaved  i jumped off stiff and cramped i could scarcely walk the air was clear though the fog of smoke overspread the sun the wind blew strong with a scent of pitch now that i was not riding the roar of the fire sounded close i caught the same strange growl the note of onsweeping fury again the creepy cold went over me i felt my face blanch and the skin tighten over my cheeks i dashed into the cabin crying fire fire fire  whoop its the kid yelled herkyjerky  he was lying near the door red as a brick in the face and panting hard in one cut i severed the rope on his feet in another that round his raw and bloody wrists herky had torn his flesh trying to release his hands  kid howd you git back hyar he questioned with his sharp little eyes glinting on me did the fire chase you whars leslie  buell fired the slash penetier is burning dick and hiram sent me back to the pool below and then didnt come they got caughtoh im afraidlost then i remembered you fellows the fires comingits awfulwe must fly  you thought of us herkys voice sounded queer and strangled bud bill did you hear thet wal wal  while he muttered on i cut bills bonds he rose without a word bud was almost unconscious he had struggled terribly his heels had dug a hole in the hard clay floor his wrists were skinned his mouth and chin covered with earth probably from his having bitten the ground in his agony herky helped him up and gave him a drink from a little pocketflask  herky if you think youve rid some in your day look at thet hoss said bill coolly from the door he eyed me coolly in fact he was as cool as if there were no fire on penetier but bud was white and sick and herky flaming with excitement  we haint got a chance listen thet roar shes hummin  its runnin up the draw we dont stand no showdown in hyar grab a hoss now an well try to head acrost the ridge  i remounted target and the three men caught horses and climbed up bareback bill led the way across the glade up the slope into the level forest there we broke into a gallop the air upon this higher ground was dark and thick but not so hard to breathe as that lower down we pressed on for a while the roar receded and almost deadened then it grew clearer again filled out and swelled bud wanted to sheer off to the left herky swore we were being surrounded bill turned a deaf ear to them from my own sense of direction i fancied we were going wrong but bill was so cool he gave me courage soon a blue windy haze shrouding the giant pines ahead caused bill to change his course  do you know whar youre headin yelled herky high above the roar  i haint got the least idee herky shouted bill as cool as could be but i guess somewhar whar itll be hot  we were lost in the forest and almost surrounded by fire if the roar was anything to tell by we galloped on always governed by the roar always avoiding the slope up the mountain if we once started up that with the fire in our rear we were doomed perhaps there were times when the wind deceived us it was hard to tell anyway we kept on growing more bewildered bud looked like a dead man already and reeled in his saddle the horses were getting hard to manage and the wind was strengthening and puffed at us from all quarters bill still looked cool but the last vestige of color had faded from his face these things boded ill herky had grown strangely silent which fact was the worst of all for me for that tough scarred reckless little wretch to hold his tongue was the last straw  the air freshened somewhat and the forest lightened almost abruptly we rode out to the edge of a great wide canyon it must have crossed the forest at right angles to the canyon we had left it was twice as wide and deep as any i had yet seen in the bottom wound a broad brook  which way now asked herky  bill shook his head far to our right a pall of smoke moved over the treetops to our left was foggy gloom behind rolled the unceasing roar we all looked straight across probably each of us harbored the same thought before that wind the fire would leap the canyon in flaming bounds and on the opposite level was the thick pitchpine forest of penetier proper so far we had been among the foothills we dared not enter the real forest with that wildfire back of us momentarily we stood irresolute it was a pause full of hopelessness such as might have come to tired deer close harried by hounds  the winding brook and the brown slope comparatively bare of trees brought me a sudden inspiration  backfire backfire i cried to my companions in wild appeal we must backfire its our chance heres the place  bud scowled and herky grumbled but bill grasped at the idea  ive heerd of backfirin the rangers do it but how how  they caught his hope and their haggard faces lightened  kid we aint forest rangers said herky do you know what youre talkin about  yes yes come on well backfire  i led the way down the slope and they came close at my heels i rode into the shallow brook and dismounted about the middle between the banks i hung my coat on the pommel of my saddle  bud you and bill hold the horses here i shouted intensely excited herky have you matches  nary a match  hyars a box said bill tossing it  come on herky you run up the brook light a match and drop it every hundred feet be sure it catches lucky theres little wind down here go as far as you can ill run down  we splashed out of the brook and leaped up the bank the grass was long and dry there was brush near by and the pineneedle mats almost bordered the bank i struck a match and dropped it  sisss flare it was almost like dropping a spark into gunpowder the flame ran quickly reached the pineneedles then sputtered and fizzed into a big blaze the first pinetree exploded and went off like a rocket we were startled by the sound and the red upleaping pillar of fire sudden heat shot back at us as if from a furnace great sparks began to fall  its goin yelled herkyjerky his voice ringing strong he clapped his hat down on my bare head then he started running upstream  i darted in the opposite direction i heard bud and bill yelling and the angry crack and hiss of the fire a few rods down i stopped struck another match and lit the grass there was a sputter and flash then the flame flared up spread like running quicksilver and meeting the pineneedles changed to red i ran on there was a loud flutter behind me then a crack almost like a shot then a seething roar another pine had gone off as i stopped to strike the third match there came three distinct reports and then others that seemed dulled in a windy roar i raced onward daring only once to look back a fearful sight met my gaze the slope was a red wave the pines were tufts of flame the air was filled with steaming clouds of whirling smoke then i fled onward again  match after match i struck and when the box was empty i must have been a mile two miles maybe more from the startingpoint i was wringingwet and there was a piercing pain in my side i plunged across the brook and in as deep water as i could find knelt down to cover all but my face then with laboring breaths that bubbled the water near my mouth i kept still and watched  the backfire which i had started swept up over the slope and down the brook like a charge of red lancers spears of flame led the advance the flame licked up the dry surfacegrass and brush and meeting the pines circled them in a whirlwind of fire like lightning flashing upward then came prolonged reports and after that a long blistering roar in the treetops even as i gazed appalled in the certainty of a horrible fate i thrilled at the grand spectacle fire had always fascinated me the clang of the engines and the call of fire would tear me from any task or play but i had never known what fire was i knew now storms of air and sea were nothing compared to this it was the greatest force in nature it was fire on one hand i seemed cool and calculated the chances on the other i had flashes in my brain and kept crying out crazily in a voice like a whisper fire fire fire  but presently the wall of fire rolled by and took the roar with it dense billows of smoke followed and hid everything in opaque darkness i heard the hiss of failing sparks and the crackle of burning wood and occasionally the crash of a failing branch it was intolerably hot but i could stand the heat better than the air i coughed and strangled i could not get my breath my eyes smarted and burned crawling close under the bank i leaned against it and waited  some hours must have passed i suffered not exactly pain but a discomfort that was almost worse byandby the air cleared a little rifts in the smoke drifted over me always toward the far side of the canyon twice i crawled out upon the bank but the heat drove me back into the water the snowwater from the mountainpeaks had changed from cold to warm still it gave a relief from the hot blast of air more time dragged by weary to the point of collapse i grew not to care about anything  then the yellow fog lightened and blew across the brook and lifted and split the parts of the canyonslope that i could see were seared and blackened the pines were columns of living coals the fire was eating into their hearts presently they would snap at the trunk crash down and burn to ashes wreathes of murky smoke circled them and drifted aloft to join the overhanging clouds  i floundered out on the bank and began to walk upstream after all it was not so very hot but i felt queer i did not seem to be able to step where i looked or see where i stepped still that caused me no worry the main thing was that the fire had not yet crossed the brook i wanted to feel overjoyed at that but i was too tired anyway i was sure the fire had crossed below or above it would be tearing down on this side presently and then i would have to crawl into the brook or burn up it did not matter much which i had to do then i grew dizzy my legs trembled my feet lost all sense of touching the ground i could not go much farther just then i heard a shout it was close by i answered and heard heavy steps i peered through the smoky haze something dark moved up in the gloom  ho kid thar you are i felt a strong arm go round my waist wal wal that was herky his voice sounded glad it roused a strange eagerness in me his rough greeting seemed to bring me back from a distance  all wet but not burned none i see we kinder was afeared say kid thet backfire now it was a dandy it did the biz our whiskers was singed but were safe an kid it was your game played like a man  after that his voice grew faint and i felt as if i were walking in a dream     xviii conclusion  that dreadful feeling of motion went away and i became unconscious of everything when i awoke the sun was gleaming dimly through thin films of smoke i was lying in a pleasant little ravine with stunted pines fringing its slopes the brook bowled merrily over stones  bud snored in the shade of a big boulder herky whistled as he broke dead branches into fagots for a campfire bill was nowhere in sight i saw several of the horses browsing along the edge of the water  my drowsy eyelids fell back again when i awoke a long time seemed to have passed the air was clearer the sky darker and the sun had gone behind the peaks i saw bill and herky skinning a deer  where are we i asked sitting up  hello kid replied herky cheerily we come up to the head of the canyon thets all howre you feelin  im all right only tired wheres the forest fire  its most burned out by now it didnt jump the canyon into the big forest thet backfire did the biz say kid wasnt settin off them pines an runnin fer your life jest like bein in a battle  it certainly was herky how long will we be penned up here  only a day or two i reckon wed better not risk takin you back to holston till were sure about the fire anyways kid you need rest youre all played out  indeed i was so weary that it took an effort to lift my hand a strange lassitude made me indifferent but herkys calm mention of taking me back to holston changed the color of my mood i began to feel more cheerful the meal we ate was scant enoughbiscuits and steaks of broiled venison with a pinch of salt but starved as we were it was more than satisfactory herky and bill were absurdly eager to serve me even bud was kind to me though he still wore conspicuously over his forehead the big bruise i had given him after i had eaten i began to gain strength but my face was puffed from the heat my injured arm was stiff and sore and my legs seemed never to have been used before  darkness came on quickly the dew fell heavily and the air grew chilly our blazing campfire was a comfort bud and bill carried in logs for firewood while herky made me a bed of dry pine needles  itll be some cold tonight he said an well hev to hug the fire now if we was down in the foothills wed be warmer hey look thar  he pointed down the ravine and i saw a great white arc of light extending up into the steely sky  the forest fire  yep shes burnin some but you oughter seen it last night not thet it aint worth seein jest now come along with me  he led me where the ravine opened wide i felt rather than saw a steep slope beneath far down was a great patch of fire it was like a crazy quilt here dark there light with streaks and stars and streams of fire shining out of the blackness masses of slowmoving smoke overhung the brighter areas the night robbed the forest fire of its fierceness and lent it a kind of glory the fire had ceased to move it had spent its force run its race and was now dying but i could not forget what it had been what it had done thousands of acres of magnificent pines had perished the shade and color and beauty of that part of the forest had gone the heart of the great trees was now slowly rolling away in those dark weird clouds of smoke i was sad for the loss and sick with fear for dick and hiram  herky must have known my mind  you neednt feel bad kid thets only a foothill or so of penetier gone up in smoke an buells sawmill went too its almost a sure thing thet leslie an old bent got out safe though they must be doin some tall worryin about you i wonder how they feel about me an bud an bill a little prematoore roastin for us eh wal wal  we went back to the camp i lay down near the fire and fell asleep some time in the night i awoke the fire was still burning brightly bud and bill were lying with their backs to it almost close enough to scorch herky sat in his shirtsleeves the smoke of his pipe and the smoke of the campfire wafted up together then i saw and felt that he had covered me with his coat and vest  i slept far into the next day herky was in camp alone the others had gone herky said and he would not tell me where he did not appear as cheerful as usual i suspected he had quarreled with his companions very likely about what was to be done with me the day passed and again i slept herky awakened me before it was light  come kid well rustle in to holston today  we cooked our breakfast of venison and then herky went in search of the horses they had browsed far up the ravine and the dawn had broken by the time he returned target stood well to be saddled nor did he bolt when i climbed up perhaps that ride i gave him had chastened and subdued his spirit well it had nearly killed me herky mounted the one horse left a sorrylooking packpony and we started down the ravine  an hour of steady descent passed by before we caught sight of any burned forest land then as we descended into the big canyon we turned a curve and saw far ahead to the left a black smoky hideous slope we kept to the right side of the brook and sheered off just as we reached a point opposite where the burned line began fire had run up that side till checked by bare weathered slopes and cliffs as far down the brook as eye could see through the smoky haze there stretched that black line of charred spearpointed pines some glowing some blazing all smoking  from time to time as we climbed up the slope i looked back the higher i got the more hideous became the outlook over the burned district i was glad when herky led the way into the deep shade of level forest shutting out the view it would take a hundred years to reforest those acres denuded of their timber by the fire of a few days but as hour after hour went by with our trail leading through miles and miles of the same old forest that had bewitched me i began to feel a little less grief at the thought of what the fire had destroyed it was a loss yet only a small part of vast penetier if only my friends had gotten out alive  herky was as relentless in his travelling as i had found him in some other ways he kept his pony at a trot the trail was open we made fast time and when the sun had begun to cast a shadow before us we were going downhill busy with the thought of my friends i scarcely noted the passing of time it was a surprise to me when we rode down the last little foothill out into the scattered pines and saw holston only a few miles across the sageflat  wal kid weve come to the partin of the ways said herky with a strange smile on his smug face  herky wont you ride in with me  naw i reckon itd not be healthy fer me  but you havent even a saddle or blanket or any grub  ive a friend across hyar a ways a rancher an hell fix me up but kid id like to hev thet hoss he was buells an buell owed me money now i calkilate you cant take target back east with you an you might as well let me have him  sure herky i jumped off at once led the horse over and held out the bridle herky dismounted and began fumbling with the stirrup straps  your legs are longern mine he explained  oh yes herky i almost forgot to return your hat i said removing the wide sombrero it had a wonderful band made of horsehair and a buckle of silver with a strange device  wal you keep the hat he replied with his back turned greaser stole your hoss an your outfits lost an you might want somethin to remember youryour friends in arizony thet hat aint much but say the buckle was an injuns i shot an i made the band when i was in jail in yuma  thank you herky ill keep it though id never need anything to make me remember arizonaor you  herky swung his bowlegs over target and i got astride the leanbacked pony there did not seem to be any more to say yet we both lingered  goodbye herky im glad i met you i said offering my hand  he gave it a squeeze that nearly crushed my fingers his keen little eyes gleamed but he turned away without another word and slapping target on the flank rode off under the trees  i put the hat back on my head and watched herky for a moment his silence and abrupt manner were unlike him but what struck me most was the fact that in our last talk every word had been clean and sincere somehow it pleased me then i started the pony toward holston  he was tired and i was ready to drop and those last few miles were long we reached the outskirts of the town perhaps a couple of hours before sundown a bank of clouds had spread out of the west and threatened rain  the first person i met was cless and he put the pony in his corral and hurried me round to the hotel on the way he talked so fast and said so much that i was bewildered before we got there the office was full of men and cless shouted to them there was the sound of a chair scraping hard on the floor then i felt myself clasped by brawny arms after that all was rather hazy in my mind i saw dick and jim and old hiram though i could not see them distinctly and i heard them all talking all questioning at once then i was talking in a somewhat silly way i thought and after that some one gave me a hot nasty drink and i felt the cool sheets of a bed  the next morning all was clear dick came to my room and tried to keep me in bed but i refused to stay we went down to breakfast and sat at a table with jim and hiram it seemed to me that i could not answer any questions till i had asked a thousand  what news had they for me buell had escaped after firing the slash his sawmill and lumbercamp and fifty thousand acres of timber had been burned the fire had in some way been confined to the foothills it had rained all night so the danger of spreading was now over my letter had brought the officers of the forest service even the chief who had been travelling west over the santa fe had stopped off and was in holston then there had been no arrests nor would there be unless buell or stockton could be found a new sawmill was to be built by the service buells lumbermen would have employment in the mill and as rangers in the forest  but i was more interested in matters which dick seemed to wish to avoid  how did you get out of the burning forest i asked for the second time  we didnt get out we went back to the pool where we sent you the packponies were there but you were gone by george i was mad and then i was just broken up i was afraid youd been burned we weathered the fire all right and then rode in to holston now the mystery is where were you  then you saved all the ponies  yes and brought your outfit in but ken wethat was awful of us to forget those poor fellows tied fast in the cabin dick looked haggard there was a dark gloom in his eyes and he gulped then i knew why he avoided certain references to the fire to be burned alive horrible ill never get over it itll haunt me always of course we had to save our own lives we had no time to go to them yet  dont let it worry you dick i interrupted  what do you mean he asked slowly  why i beat the fire up to the cabin thats all buells horse can run some i cut the men loose and we made up across the ridge got lost surrounded by fire and then i got herky to help me start a backfire in that big canyon  backfire exclaimed dick slamming the table with his big fist then he settled down and looked at me hiram looked at me jim looked at me and not one of them said a word for what seemed a long time it brought the blood to my face but for all my embarrassment it was sweet praise at last dick broke the silence  ken ward this stumps me i tell us about it  so i related my adventures from the moment they had left me till we met again  it was a wild boys trick kenthat ride in the very face of fire in a dry forest but thank god you saved the lives of those fellows amen exclaimed old hiram fervently my lad you saved penetier too thars no doubt on it the fire was sweepin up the canyon an it would have crossed the brook somewhars in thet stretch you backfired  ken you shore was born in texas drawl jim williams  his remark was unrelated to our talk i did not know what he meant by it nevertheless it pleased me more than anything that had ever been said me in my life  then came the reading of letters that had a rived for me in hals letter first and last harped on having been left behind father sent me a check and wrote that in the event of a trouble in the lumber district he trusted me to take the first train for harrisburg that i knew meant that i must get out of my ragged clothes that i did and packed them upall except herky sombrero which i wore then i went to the railroad station to see the schedule and i compromised with father by deciding to take the limited the fast eastbound train had gone a little before and the next one did not leave until six oclock they would give me half a day with my friends  when i returned to the hotel dick was looking for me he carried me off upstairs to a hall full of men at one end were tables littered with papers and here men were signing their name dick explained that forest rangers were being paid and new ones hired then he introduced me officers of the service and the chief i knew by the way they looked at me that dick had been talking it made me so tonguetied that i could not find my voice when the chief spoke to me and shook my hand warmly he was a tall man with a fine face and kind eyes and hair just touched with gray  kenneth ward he went on pleasantly i hope that letter of introduction i dictated for you some time ago has been of some service  i havent had a chance to use it yet i blurted out and i dived into my pocket to bring forth the letter it was wrinkled soiled and had been soaked with water i began to apologize for its disreputable appearance when he interrupted me  ive heard about the ducking you got and all the rest of it he said smiling then his manner changed to one of business and hurry  you are studying forestry  yes sir im going to college this fall  my friend in harrisburg wrote me of your ambition and i may say aptness for the forest service im very much pleased we need a host of bright young fellows here look at this map  he drew my attention to a map lying on the table and made crosses and tracings with a pencil while he talked  this is penetier here are the arizona peaks the heavy shading represents timbered land all these are canyons heres oak creek canyon the one the fire bordered now i want you to tell me how you worked that backfire and if you can mark the line you fired  this appeared to me an easy task and certainly one i was enthusiastic over i told him just how i had come to the canyon and how i saw that the fire would surely cross there and that a backfire was the only chance then carefully studying the map i marked off the three miles herky and i had fired  very good you had help in this  yes a fellow called herkyjerky he was one of buells men who kept me a prisoner  but he turned out a pretty good sort didnt he  indeed yes sir  well ill try to locate him and offer him a job in the service now mr ward youve had special opportunities you have an eye in your head and you are interested in forestry perhaps you can help us personally i shall be most pleased to hear what you think might be done in penetier  i gasped and stared and could scarcely believe my ears but he was not joking he was as serious as if he had addressed himself to one of his officers i looked at them all standing interested and expectant dick was as grave and erect as a deacon jim seemed much impressed but old hiram bent standing somewhat back of the others deliberately winked at me  but for that wink i never could have seized my opportunity it made me remember my talks with hiram so i boiled down all that i had learned and launched it on the chief whether i was brief or not i was out of breath when i stopped he appeared much surprised  thank you he said finally you certainly have been observant then he turned to his officers gentlemen heres a new point of view from firsthand observation i call it splendid conservation its in the line of my policy it considers the settler and lumberman instead of combating him  he shook hands with me again you may be sure ill not lose sight of you of course you will be coming west next summer after your term at college  yes sir i want toif dick  he smiled as i hesitated that man read my mind like an open book  mr leslie goes to the coconina forest as head forest ranger mr williams goes as his assistant and i have appointed mr bent game warden in the same forest you may spend next summer with them  i stammered some kind of thanks and found myself going out and downstairs with my friends  oh dick wasnt he fine say wheres coconina forest  its over across the desert and beyond the grand canyon of arizona penetier is tame compared to coconina im afraid to let you come out there  i dont have to ask you mr dick i replied  lad ill need a young fellar bad next summer said old hiram with twinkling eyes one as can handle a rope an help tie up lions an sich  oh my bear cub id forgotten him i wanted to take him home  wal thar werent no sense in thet youngster fer you couldnt do it he was a husky cub  i hate to give up my mustang too dick have you heard of the greaser  not yet but hell be trailing into holston before long  jim williams removed his pipe and puffed a cloud of white smoke  ken i shore aint fergot greaser he drawled with his slow smile hev you any pertickler thing you want did to him  jim dont kill him i burst out impetuously and then paused frightened out of speech why i was afraid of him i did not know he seemed so easygoing so carelessalmost sweet like a woman but then i had seen his face once with a look that i could never forget  wal ken ill dodge greaser if he ever crosses my trail again  that promise was a relief i knew greaser would come to a bad end and certainly would get his just deserts but i did not want him punished any more for what he had done to me  those last few hours sped like winged moments we talked and planned a little i divided my outfit among my friends and then it was time for the train that limited train had been late so they said every day for a week and this day it was on time to the minute i had no luck  my friends bade me goodbye as if they expected to see me next day and i said goodbye calmly i had my part to play my short stay with them had made me somehow different but my coolness was deceitful dick helped me on the train and wrung my hand again  goodbye ken its been great to have you out next year youll be back in the forests  he had to hurry to get off the train started as i looked out of my window there stood the powerful hunter his white head bare and he was waving his hat jim leaned against a railing with his sleepy careless smile i caught a gleam of the blue gun swinging at his hip dicks eyes shone warm and blue he was shouting something then they all passed back out of sight so my gaze wandered to the indistinct black line of penetier to the purple slopes and up to the cold white mountainpeaks and dicks voice rang in my ears like a prophecy youll be back in the forests
