and tears  chapter iii the plot thickens  chapter iv the awful revelation  chapter v the frightful catastrophe      burlesque autobiography  two or three persons having at different times intimated that if i would write an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure i yield at last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history  ours is a noble old house and stretches a long way back into antiquity the earliest ancestor the twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of higgins this was in the eleventh century when our people were living in aberdeen county of cork england why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness instead of higgins is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir it is a kind of vague pretty romance and we leave it alone all the old families do that way  arthour twain was a man of considerable notea solicitor on the highway in william rufus time at about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old english places of resort called newgate to see about something and never returned again while there he died suddenly  augustus twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year 1160 he was as full of fun as he could be and used to take his old sabre and sharpen it up and get in a convenient place on a dark night and stick it through people as they went by to see them jump he was a born humorist but he got to going too far with it and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties the authorities removed one end of him and put it up on a nice high place on temple bar where it could contemplate the people and have a good time he never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long  then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiersnoble highspirited fellows who always went into battle singing right behind the army and always went out awhooping right ahead of it  this is a scathing rebuke to old dead froissarts poor witticism that our family tree never had but one limb to it and that that one stuck out at right angles and bore fruit winter and summer                                                                                                                               o                                 \                                                                                                                                                                          our family tree  early in the fifteenth century we have beau twain called the scholar he wrote a beautiful beautiful hand and he could imitate anybodys hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it he had infinite sport with his talent but by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand still he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business which with inconsiderable intervals was some fortytwo years in fact he died in harness during all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till government gave him another he was a perfect pet and he was always a favorite with his fellowartists and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society called the chain gang he always wore his hair short had a preference for striped clothes and died lamented by the government he was a sore loss to his country for he was so regular  some years later we have the illustrious john morgan twain he came over to this country with columbus in 1492 as a passenger he appears to have been of a crusty uncomfortable disposition he complained of the food all the way over and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change he wanted fresh shad hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air sneering about the commander and saying he did not believe columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before the memorable cry of land ho thrilled every heart in the ship but his he gazed a while through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water and then said land be hangedits a raft  when this questionable passenger came on board the ship he brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked b g one cotton sock marked l w c one woollen one marked d f and a nightshirt marked o m r and yet during the voyage he worried more about his trunk and gave himself more airs about it than all the rest of the passengers put together  if the ship was down by the head and would not steer he would go and move his trunk farther aft and then watch the effect if the ship was by the stern he would suggest to columbus to detail some men to shift that baggage in storms he had to be gagged because his wailings about his trunk made it impossible for the men to hear the orders the man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing but it is noted in the ships log as a curious circumstance that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper he took it ashore in four trunks a queensware crate and a couple of champagne baskets but when he came back insinuating in an insolent swaggering way that some of his things were missing and was going to search the other passengers baggage it was too much and they threw him overboard they watched long and wonderingly for him to come up but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide but while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side and the interest was momentarily increasing it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor cable hanging limp from the bow then in the ships dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note             in time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde           gonne downe and got ye anchor and toke ye same and solde it to           ye dam sauvages from ye interior saying yt he hadde founde it           ye sonne of a ghun  yet this ancestor had good and noble instincts and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our indians he built a commodious jail and put up a gallows and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them at this point the chronicle becomes less frank and chatty and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in america and while there received injuries which terminated in his death  the great grandson of the reformer flourished in sixteen hundred and something and was known in our annals as the old admiral though in history he had other titles he was long in command of fleets of swift vessels well armed and manned and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on always made good fair time across the ocean but if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longerand then he would take that ship home where he lived and keep it there carefully expecting the owners to come for it but they never did and he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating exercise and a bath he called it walking a plank all the pupils liked it at any rate they never found any fault with it after trying it when the owners were late coming for their ships the admiral always burned them so that the insurance money should not be lost at last this fine old tar was cut down in the fulness of his years and honors and to her dying day his poor heartbroken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated  charles henry twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century and was a zealous and distinguished missionary he converted sixteen thousand south sea islanders and taught them that a dogtooth necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in his poor flock loved him very very dearly and when his funeral was over they got up in a body and came out of the restaurant with tears in their eyes and saying one to another that he was a good tender missionary and they wished they had some more of him  pahgotowahwahpukketekeewis mightyhunterwithahogeye twain adorned the middle of the eighteenth century and aided gen braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor washington it was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our washington from behind a tree so far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral storybooks is correct but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awestricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the great spirit for some mighty mission and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again the narrative seriously impairs the integrity of history what he did say was  it aint no hic no use at mans so drunk he cant stan still long enough for a man to hit him i hic i cant ford to fool away any more amnition on him  that was why he stopped at the seventeenth round and it was a good plain matteroffact reason too and one that easily commends itself to us by the eloquent persuasive flavor of probability there is about it  i always enjoyed the storybook narrative but i felt a marring misgiving that every indian at braddocks defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times two easily grows to seventeen in a century and missed him jumped to the conclusion that the great spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission and so i somehow feared that the only reason why washingtons case is remembered and the others forgotten is that in his the prophecy came true and in that of the others it didnt there are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies indians and other unauthorized parties have made but one may carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled  i will remark here in passing that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well known in history by their aliases that i have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them or even mention them in the order of their birth among these may be mentioned richard brinsley twain alias guy fawkes john wentworth twain alias sixteenstring jack william hogarth twain alias jack sheppard ananias twain alias baron munchausen john george twain alias capt kydd and then there are george francis train tom pepper nebuchadnezzar and baalams assthey all belong to our family but to a branch of it somewhat distantly removed from the honorable direct linein fact a collateral branch whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged  it is not well when writing an autobiography to follow your ancestry down too close to your own timeit is safest to speak only vaguely of your greatgrandfather and then skip from there to yourself which i now do  i was born without teethand there richard iii had the advantage of me but i was born without a humpback likewise and there i had the advantage of him my parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest  but now a thought occurs to me my own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until i am hanged if some other biographies i have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred it would have been a felicitous thing for the reading public how does it strike you      awful terrible medieval romance    chapter i the secret revealed  it was night stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of klugenstein the year 1222 was drawing to a close far away up in the tallest of the castles towers a single light glimmered a secret council was being held there the stern old lord of klugenstein sat in a chair of state meditating presently he said with a tender accent  my daughter  a young man of noble presence clad from head to heel in knightly mail answered  speak father  my daughter the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that hath puzzled all your young life know then that it had its birth in the matters which i shall now unfold my brother ulrich is the great duke of brandenburgh our father on his deathbed decreed that if no son were born to ulrich the succession should pass to my house provided a son were born to me and further in case no son were born to either but only daughters then the succession should pass to ulrichs daughter if she proved stainless if she did not my daughter should succeed if she retained a blameless name and so i and my old wife here prayed fervently for the good boon of a son but the prayer was vain you were born to us i was in despair i saw the mighty prize slipping from my grasp the splendid dream vanishing away and i had been so hopeful five years had ulrich lived in wedlock and yet his wife had borne no heir of either sex  but hold i said all is not lost a saving scheme had shot athwart my brain you were born at midnight only the leech the nurse and six waitingwomen knew your sex i hanged them every one before an hour had sped next morning all the barony went mad with rejoicing over the proclamation that a son was born to klugenstein an heir to mighty brandenburgh and well the secret has been kept your mothers own sister nursed your infancy and from that time forward we feared nothing  when you were ten years old a daughter was born to ulrich we grieved but hoped for good results from measles or physicians or other natural enemies of infancy but were always disappointed she lived she throveheavens malison upon her but it is nothing we are safe for haha have we not a son and is not our son the future duke our wellbeloved conrad is it not sofor woman of eightandtwenty yearsas you are my child none other name than that hath ever fallen to you  now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my brother and he waxes feeble the cares of state do tax him sore therefore he wills that you shall come to him and be already dukein act though not yet in name your servitors are readyyou journey forth tonight  now listen well remember every word i say there is a law as old as germany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal chair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people she shall die so heed my words pretend humility pronounce your judgments from the premiers chair which stands at the foot of the throne do this until you are crowned and safe it is not likely that your sex will ever be discovered but still it is the part of wisdom to make all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life  oh my father is it for this my life hath been a lie was it that i might cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights spare me father spare your child  what huzzy is this my reward for the august fortune my brain has wrought for thee by the bones of my father this puling sentiment of thine but ill accords with my humor  betake thee to the duke instantly and beware how thou meddlest with my purpose  let this suffice of the conversation it is enough for us to know that the prayers the entreaties and the tears of the gentlenatured girl availed nothing they nor anything could move the stout old lord of klugenstein and so at last with a heavy heart the daughter saw the castle gates close behind her and found herself riding away in the darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed vassals and a brave following of servants  the old baron sat silent for many minutes after his daughters departure and then he turned to his sad wife and said  dame our matters seem speeding fairly it is full three months since i sent the shrewd and handsome count detzin on his devilish mission to my brothers daughter constance if he fail we are not wholly safe but if he do succeed no power can bar our girl from being duchess een though illfortune should decree she never should be duke  my heart is full of bodings yet all may still be well  tush woman leave the owls to croak to bed with ye and dream of brandenburgh and grandeur      chapter ii festivity and tears  six days after the occurrences related in the above chapter the brilliant capital of the duchy of brandenburgh was resplendent with military pageantry and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes for conrad the young heir to the crown was come the old dukes heart was full of happiness for conrads handsome person and graceful bearing had won his love at once the great halls of the palace were thronged with nobles who welcomed conrad bravely and so bright and happy did all things seem that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away and giving place to a comforting contentment  but in a remote apartment of the palace a scene of a different nature was transpiring by a window stood the dukes only child the lady constance her eyes were red and swollen and full of tears she was alone presently she fell to weeping anew and said aloud  the villain detzin is gonehas fled the dukedom i could not believe it at first but alas it is too true and i loved him so i dared to love him though i knew the duke my father would never let me wed him i loved himbut now i hate him with all my soul i hate him oh what is to become of me i am lost lost lost i shall go mad      chapter iii the plot thickens  a few months drifted by all men published the praises of the young conrads government and extolled the wisdom of his judgments the mercifulness of his sentences and the modesty with which he bore himself in his great office the old duke soon gave everything into his hands and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his heir delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier it seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all men as conrad was could not be otherwise than happy but strange enough he was not for he saw with dismay that the princess constance had begun to love him the love of the rest of the world was happy fortune for him but this was freighted with danger and he saw moreover that the delighted duke had discovered his daughters passion likewise and was already dreaming of a marriage every day somewhat of the deep sadness that had been in the princess face faded away every day hope and animation beamed brighter from her eye and by and by even vagrant smiles visited the face that had been so troubled  conrad was appalled he bitterly cursed himself for having yielded to the instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own sex when he was new and a stranger in the palacewhen he was sorrowful and yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel he now began to avoid his cousin but this only made matters worse for naturally enough the more he avoided her the more she cast herself in his way he marvelled at this at first and next it startled him the girl haunted him she hunted him she happened upon him at all times and in all places in the night as well as in the day she seemed singularly anxious there was surely a mystery somewhere  this could not go on forever all the world was talking about it the duke was beginning to look perplexed poor conrad was becoming a very ghost through dread and dire distress one day as he was emerging from a private anteroom attached to the picture gallery constance confronted him and seizing both his hands in hers exclaimed  oh why do you avoid me what have i donewhat have i said to lose your kind opinion of mefor surely i had it once conrad do not despise me but pity a tortured heart i cannotcannot hold the words unspoken longer lest they kill mei love you conrad there despise me if you must but they would be uttered  conrad was speechless constance hesitated a moment and then misinterpreting his silence a wild gladness flamed in her eyes and she flung her arms about his neck and said  you relent you relent you can love meyou will love me oh say you will my own my worshipped conrad  conrad groaned aloud a sickly pallor overspread his countenance and he trembled like an aspen presently in desperation he thrust the poor girl from him and cried  you know not what you ask it is forever and ever impossible and then he fled like a criminal and left the princess stupefied with amazement a minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there and conrad was crying and sobbing in his chamber both were in despair both saw ruin staring them in the face  by and by constance rose slowly to her feet and moved away saying  to think that he was despising my love at the very moment that i thought it was melting his cruel heart i hate him he spurned medid this manhe spurned me from him like a dog      chapter iv the awful revelation  time passed on a settled sadness rested once more upon the countenance of the good dukes daughter she and conrad were seen together no more now the duke grieved at this but as the weeks wore away conrads color came back to his cheeks and his oldtime vivacity to his eye and he administered the government with a clear and steadily ripening wisdom  presently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace it grew louder it spread farther the gossips of the city got hold of it it swept the dukedom and this is what the whisper said  the lady constance hath given birth to a child  when the lord of klugenstein heard it he swung his plumed helmet thrice around his head and shouted  long live duke conradfor lo his crown is sure from this day forward detzin has done his errand well and the good scoundrel shall be rewarded  and he spread the tidings far and wide and for eightandforty hours no soul in all the barony but did dance and sing carouse and illuminate to celebrate the great event and all at proud and happy old klugensteins expense      chapter v the frightful catastrophe  the trial was at hand all the great lords and barons of brandenburgh were assembled in the hall of justice in the ducal palace no space was left unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit conrad clad in purple and ermine sat in the premiers chair and on either side sat the great judges of the realm the old duke had sternly commanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed without favor and then had taken to his bed brokenhearted his days were numbered poor conrad had begged as for his very life that he might be spared the misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousins crime but it did not avail  the saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in conrads breast  the gladdest was in his fathers for unknown to his daughter conrad the old baron klugenstein was come and was among the crowd of nobles triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house  after the heralds had made due proclamation and the other preliminaries had followed the venerable lord chief justice said  prisoner stand forth  the unhappy princess rose and stood unveiled before the vast multitude the lord chief justice continued  most noble lady before the great judges of this realm it hath been charged and proven that out of holy wedlock your grace hath given birth unto a child and by our ancient law the penalty is death excepting in one sole contingency whereof his grace the acting duke our good lord conrad will advertise you in his solemn sentence now wherefore give heed  conrad stretched forth the reluctant sceptre and in the selfsame moment the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned pityingly toward the doomed prisoner and the tears came into his eyes he opened his lips to speak but the lord chief justice said quickly  not there your grace not there it is not lawful to pronounce judgment upon any of the ducal line save from the ducal throne  a shudder went to the heart of poor conrad and a tremor shook the iron frame of his old father likewise conrad had not been crowneddared he profane the throne he hesitated and turned pale with fear but it must be done wondering eyes were already upon him they would be suspicious eyes if he hesitated longer he ascended the throne presently he stretched forth the sceptre again and said  prisoner in the name of our sovereign lord ulrich duke of brandenburgh i proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me give heed to my words by the ancient law of the land except you produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner you must surely die embrace this opportunitysave yourself while yet you may name the father of your child  a solemn hush fell upon the great courta silence so profound that men could hear their own hearts beat then the princess slowly turned with eyes gleaming with hate and pointing her finger straight at conrad said  thou art the man  an appalling conviction of his helpless hopeless peril struck a chill to conrads heart like the chill of death itself what power on earth could save him to disprove the charge he must reveal that he was a woman and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the ducal chair was death at one and the same moment he and his grim old father swooned and fell to the ground  the remainder of this thrilling and eventful story will not be found in this or any other publication either now or at any future time  the truth is i have got my hero or heroine into such a particularly close place that i do not see how i am ever going to get him or her out of it againand therefore i will wash my hands of the whole business and leave that person to get out the best way that offersor else stay there i thought it was going to be easy enough to straighten out that little difficulty but it looks different now   if harpers weekly or the new york tribune desire to copy these initial chapters into the reading columns of their valuable journals just as they do the opening chapters of ledger and new york weekly novels they are at liberty to do so at the usual rates provided they trust  mark twain
