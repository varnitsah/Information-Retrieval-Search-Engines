42663104	experimental researches in electricity  by  michael faraday dcl frs  fullerian profesor of chemistry in the royal institution corresponding member etc of the royal and imperial academies of science of paris petersburgh florence copenhagen berlin gottingen modena stockholm palermo etc etc  in two volumes  vol i  second edition  reprinted from the philosophical transactions of 18311838  london richard and john edward taylor printers and publishers to the university of london red lion court fleet street  1849        preface   i have been induced by various circumstances to collect in one volume the fourteen series of experimental researches in electricity which have appeared in the philosophical transactions during the last seven years the chief reason has been the desire to supply at a moderate price the whole of these papers with an index to those who may desire to have them  the readers of the volume will i hope do me the justice to remember that it was not written as a whole but in parts the earlier portions rarely having any known relation at the time to those which might follow if i had rewritten the work i perhaps might have considerably varied the form but should not have altered much of the real matter it would not however then have been considered a faithful reprint or statement of the course and results of the whole investigation which only i desired to supply  i may be allowed to express my great satisfaction at finding that the different parts written at intervals during seven years harmonize so well as they do there would have been nothing particular in this if the parts had related only to matters wellascertained before any of them were writtenbut as each professes to contain something of original discovery or of correction of received views it does surprise even my partiality that they should have the degree of consistency and apparent general accuracy which they seem to me to present  i have made some alterations in the text but they have been altogether of a typographical or grammatical character and even where greatest have been intended to explain the sense not to alter it i have often added notes at the bottom of the page as to paragraphs 59 360 439 521 552 555 598 657 883 for the correction of errors and also the purpose of illustration but these are all distinguished from the original notes of the researches by the date of dec 1838  the date of a scientific paper containing any pretensions to discovery is frequently a matter of serious importance and it is a great misfortune that there are many most valuable communications essential to the history and progress of science with respect to which this point cannot now be ascertained this arises from the circumstance of the papers having no dates attached to them individually and of the journals in which they appear having such as are inaccurate ie dates of a period earlier than that of publication i may refer to the note at the end of the first series as an illustration of the kind of confusion thus produced these circumstances have induced me to affix a date at the top of every other page and i have thought myself justified in using that placed by the secretary of the royal society on each paper as it was received an author has no right perhaps to claim an earlier one unless it has received confirmation by some public act or officer  before concluding these lines i would beg leave to make a reference or two first to my own papers on electromagnetic rotations in the quarterly journal of science 1822 xii 74 186 283 416 and also to my letter on magnetoelectric induction in the annales de chimie li p 404 these might as to the matter very properly have appeared in this volume but they would have interfered with it as a simple reprint of the experimental researches of the philosophical transactions  then i wish to refer in relation to the fourth series on a new law of electric conduction to franklins experiments on the nonconduction of ice which have been very properly separated and set forth by professor bache journal of the franklin institute 1836 xvii 183 these which i did not at all remember as to the extent of the effect though they in no way anticipate the expression of the law i state as to the general effect of liquefaction on electrolytes still should never be forgotten when speaking of that law as applicable to the case of water  there are two papers which i am anxious to refer to as corrections or criticisms of parts of the experimental researches the first of these is one by jacobi philosophical magazine 1838 xiii 401 relative to the possible production of a spark on completing the junction of the two metals of a single pair of plates 915 it is an excellent paper and though i have not repeated the experiments the description of them convinces me that i must have been in error the second is by that excellent philosopher marianini memoria della societa italiana di modena xxi 205 and is a critical and experimental examination of series viii and of the question whether metallic contact is or is not productive of a part of the electricity of the voltaic pile i see no reason as yet to alter the opinion i have given but the paper is so very valuable comes to the question so directly and the point itself is of such great importance that i intend at the first opportunity renewing the inquiry and if i can rendering the proofs either on the one side or the other undeniable to all  other parts of these researches have received the honour of critical attention from various philosophers to all of whom i am obliged and some of whose corrections i have acknowledged in the foot notes there are no doubt occasions on which i have not felt the force of the remarks but time and the progress of science will best settle such cases and although i cannot honestly say that i wish to be found in error yet i do fervently hope that the progress of science in the hands of its many zealous present cultivators will be such as by giving us new and other developments and laws more and more general in their applications will even make me think that what is written and illustrated in these experimental researches belongs to the bygone parts of science  michael faraday  royal institution march 1839    contents

tension possesses of causing an opposite electrical state in its vicinity has been expressed by the general term induction which as it has been received into scientific language may also with propriety be used in the same general sense to express the power which electrical currents may possess of inducing any particular state upon matter in their immediate neighbourhood otherwise indifferent it is with this meaning that i purpose using it in the present paper  2 certain effects of the induction of electrical currents have already been recognised and described as those of magnetization ampères experiments of bringing a copper disc near to a flat spiral his repetition with electromagnets of aragos extraordinary experiments and perhaps a few others still it appeared unlikely that these could be all the effects which induction by currents could produce especially as upon dispensing with iron almost the whole of them disappear whilst yet an infinity of bodies exhibiting definite phenomena of induction with electricity of tension still remain to be acted upon by the induction of electricity in motion  3 further whether ampères beautiful theory were adopted or any other or whatever reservation were mentally made still it appeared very extraordinary that as every electric current was accompanied by a corresponding intensity of magnetic action at right angles to the current good conductors of electricity when placed within the sphere of this action should not have any current induced through them or some sensible effect produced equivalent in force to such a current  4 these considerations with their consequence the hope of obtaining electricity from ordinary magnetism have stimulated me at various times to investigate experimentally the inductive effect of electric currents i lately arrived at positive results and not only had my hopes fulfilled but obtained a key which appeared to me to open out a full explanation of aragos magnetic phenomena and also to discover a new state which may probably have great influence in some of the most important effects of electric currents  5 these results i purpose describing not as they were obtained but in such a manner as to give the most concise view of the whole   § 1 induction of electric currents   6 about twentysix feet of copper wire one twentieth of an inch in diameter were wound round a cylinder of wood as a helix the different spires of which were prevented from touching by a thin interposed twine this helix was covered with calico and then a second wire applied in the same manner in this way twelve helices were superposed each containing an average length of wire of twentyseven feet and all in the same direction the first third fifth seventh ninth and eleventh of these helices were connected at their extremities end to end so as to form one helix the others were connected in a similar manner and thus two principal helices were produced closely interposed having the same direction not touching anywhere and each containing one hundred and fiftyfive feet in length of wire  7 one of these helices was connected with a galvanometer the other with a voltaic battery of ten pairs of plates four inches square with double coppers and well charged yet not the slightest sensible reflection of the galvanometerneedle could be observed  8 a similar compound helix consisting of six lengths of copper and six of soft iron wire was constructed the resulting iron helix contained two hundred and fourteen feet of wire the resulting copper helix two hundred and eight feet but whether the current from the trough was passed through the copper or the iron helix no effect upon the other could be perceived at the galvanometer  9 in these and many similar experiments no difference in action of any kind appeared between iron and other metals  10 two hundred and three feet of copper wire in one length were coiled round a large block of wood other two hundred and three feet of similar wire were interposed as a spiral between the turns of the first coil and metallic contact everywhere prevented by twine one of these helices was connected with a galvanometer and the other with a battery of one hundred pairs of plates four inches square with double coppers and well charged when the contact was made there was a sudden and very slight effect at the galvanometer and there was also a similar slight effect when the contact with the battery was broken but whilst the voltaic current was continuing to pass through the one helix no galvanometrical appearances nor any effect like induction upon the other helix could be perceived although the active power of the battery was proved to be great by its heating the whole of its own helix and by the brilliancy of the discharge when made through charcoal  11 repetition of the experiments with a battery of one hundred and twenty pairs of plates produced no other effects but it was ascertained both at this and the former time that the slight deflection of the needle occurring at the moment of completing the connexion was always in one direction and that the equally slight deflection produced when the contact was broken was in the other direction and also that these effects occurred when the first helices were used 6 8  12 the results which i had by this time obtained with magnets led me to believe that the battery current through one wire did in reality induce a similar current through the other wire but that it continued for an instant only and partook more of the nature of the electrical wave passed through from the shock of a common leyden jar than of the current from a voltaic battery and therefore might magnetise a steel needle although it scarcely affected the galvanometer  13 this expectation was confirmed for on substituting a small hollow helix formed round a glass tube for the galvanometer introducing a steel needle making contact as before between the battery and the inducing wire 7 10 and then removing the needle before the battery contact was broken it was found magnetised  14 when the battery contact was first made then an unmagnetised needle introduced into the small indicating helix 13 and lastly the battery contact broken the needle was found magnetised to an equal degree apparently as before but the poles were of the contrary kind  15 the same effects took place on using the large compound helices first described 6 8  16 when the unmagnetised needle was put into the indicating helix before contact of the inducing wire with the battery and remained there until the contact was broken it exhibited little or no magnetism the first effect having been nearly neutralised by the second 13 14 the force of the induced current upon making contact was found always to exceed that of the induced current at breaking of contact and if therefore the contact was made and broken many times in succession whilst the needle remained in the indicating helix it at last came out not unmagnetised but a needle magnetised as if the induced current upon making contact had acted alone on it this effect may be due to the accumulation as it is called at the poles of the unconnected pile rendering the current upon first making contact more powerful than what it is afterwards at the moment of breaking contact  17 if the circuit between the helix or wire under induction and the galvanometer or indicating spiral was not rendered complete before the connexion between the battery and the inducing wire was completed or broken then no effects were perceived at the galvanometer thus if the battery communications were first made and then the wire under induction connected with the indicating helix no magnetising power was there exhibited but still retaining the latter communications when those with the battery were broken a magnet was formed in the helix but of the second kind 14 ie with poles indicating a current in the same direction to that belonging to the battery current or to that always induced by that current at its cessation  18 in the preceding experiments the wires were placed near to each other and the contact of the inducing one with the buttery made when the inductive effect was required but as the particular action might be supposed to be exerted only at the moments of making and breaking contact the induction was produced in another way several feet of copper wire were stretched in wide zigzag forms representing the letter w on one surface of a broad board a second wire was stretched in precisely similar forms on a second board so that when brought near the first the wires should everywhere touch except that a sheet of thick paper was interposed one of these wires was connected with the galvanometer and the other with a voltaic battery the first wire was then moved towards the second and as it approached the needle was deflected being then removed the needle was deflected in the opposite direction by first making the wires approach and then recede simultaneously with the vibrations of the needle the latter soon became very extensive but when the wires ceased to move from or towards each other the galvanometerneedle soon came to its usual position  19 as the wires approximated the induced current was in the contrary direction to the inducing current as the wires receded the induced current was in the same direction as the inducing current when the wires remained stationary there was no induced current 54  20 when a small voltaic arrangement was introduced into the circuit between the galvanometer 10 and its helix or wire so as to cause a permanent deflection of 30° or 40° and then the battery of one hundred pairs of plates connected with the inducing wire there was an instantaneous action as before 11 but the galvanometerneedle immediately resumed and retained its place unaltered notwithstanding the continued contact of the inducing wire with the trough such was the case in whichever way the contacts were made 33  21 hence it would appear that collateral currents either in the same or in opposite directions exert no permanent inducing power on each other affecting their quantity or tension  22 i could obtain no evidence by the tongue by spark or by heating fine wire or charcoal of the electricity passing through the wire under induction neither could i obtain any chemical effects though the contacts with metallic and other solutions were made and broken alternately with those of the battery so that the second effect of induction should not oppose or neutralise the first 13 16  23 this deficiency of effect is not because the induced current of electricity cannot pass fluids but probably because of its brief duration and feeble intensity for on introducing two large copper plates into the circuit on the induced side 20 the plates being immersed in brine but prevented from touching each other by an interposed cloth the effect at the indicating galvanometer or helix occurred as before the induced electricity could also pass through a voltaic trough 20 when however the quantity of interposed fluid was reduced to a drop the galvanometer gave no indication  24 attempts to obtain similar effects by the use of wires conveying ordinary electricity were doubtful in the results a compound helix similar to that already described containing eight elementary helices 6 was used four of the helices had their similar ends bound together by wire and the two general terminations thus produced connected with the small magnetising helix containing an unmagnetised needle 13 the other four helices were similarly arranged but their ends connected with a leyden jar on passing the discharge the needle was found to be a magnet but it appeared probable that a part of the electricity of the jar had passed off to the small helix and so magnetised the needle there was indeed no reason to expect that the electricity of a jar possessing as it does great tension would not diffuse itself through all the metallic matter interposed between the coatings  25 still it does not follow that the discharge of ordinary electricity through a wire does not produce analogous phenomena to those arising from voltaic electricity but as it appears impossible to separate the effects produced at the moment when the discharge begins to pass from the equal and contrary effects produced when it ceases to pass 16 inasmuch as with ordinary electricity these periods are simultaneous so there can be scarcely any hope that in this form of the experiment they can be perceived  26 hence it is evident that currents of voltaic electricity present phenomena of induction somewhat analogous to those produced by electricity of tension although as will be seen hereafter many differences exist between them the result is the production of other currents but which are only momentary parallel or tending to parallelism with the inducing current by reference to the poles of the needle formed in the indicating helix 13 14 and to the deflections of the galvanometerneedle 11 it was found in all cases that the induced current produced by the first action of the inducing current was in the contrary direction to the latter but that the current produced by the cessation of the inducing current was in the same direction 19 for the purpose of avoiding periphrasis i propose to call this action of the current from the voltaic battery voltaelectric induction the properties of the second wire after induction has developed the first current and whilst the electricity from the battery continues to flow through its inducing neighbour 10 18 constitute a peculiar electric condition the consideration of which will be resumed hereafter 60 all these results have been obtained with a voltaic apparatus consisting of a single pair of plates   § 2 evolution of electricity from magnetism   27 a welded ring was made of soft round bariron the metal being seveneighths of an inch in thickness and the ring six inches in external diameter three helices were put round one part of this ring each containing about twentyfour feet of copper wire one twentieth of an inch thick they were insulated from the iron and each other and superposed in the manner before described 6 occupying about nine inches in length upon the ring they could be used separately or conjointly the group may be distinguished by the letter a pl i fig 1 on the other part of the ring about sixty feet of similar copper wire in two pieces were applied in the same manner forming a helix b which had the same common direction with the helices of a but being separated from it at each extremity by about half an inch of the uncovered iron  28 the helix b was connected by copper wires with a galvanometer three feet from the ring the helices of a were connected end to end so as to form one common helix the extremities of which were connected with a battery of ten pairs of plates four inches square the galvanometer was immediately affected and to a degree far beyond what has been described when with a battery of tenfold power helices without iron were used 10 but though the contact was continued the effect was not permanent for the needle soon came to rest in its natural position as if quite indifferent to the attached electromagnetic arrangement upon breaking the contact with the batterry the needle was again powerfully deflected but in the contrary direction to that induced in the first instance  29 upon arranging the apparatus so that b should be out of use the galvanometer be connected with one of the three wires of a 27 and the other two made into a helix through which the current from the trough 28 was passed similar but rather more powerful effects were produced  30 when the battery contact was made in one direction the galvanometerneedle was deflected on the one side if made in the other direction the deflection was on the other side the deflection on breaking the battery contact was always the reverse of that produced by completing it the deflection on making a battery contact always indicated an induced current in the opposite direction to that from the battery but on breaking the contact the deflection indicated an induced current in the same direction as that of the battery no making or breaking of the contact at b side or in any part of the galvanometer circuit produced any effect at the galvanometer no continuance of the battery current caused any deflection of the galvanometerneedle as the above results are common to all these experiments and to similar ones with ordinary magnets to be hereafter detailed they need not be again particularly described  31 upon using the power of one hundred pairs of plates 10 with this ring the impulse at the galvanometer when contact was completed or broken was so great as to make the needle spin round rapidly four or five times before the air and terrestrial magnetism could reduce its motion to mere oscillation  32 by using charcoal at the ends of the b helix a minute spark could be perceived when the contact of the battery with a was completed this spark could not be due to any diversion of a part of the current of the battery through the iron to the helix b for when the battery contact was continued the galvanometer still resumed its perfectly indifferent state 28 the spark was rarely seen on breaking contact a small platina wire could not be ignited by this induced current but there seems every reason to believe that the effect would be obtained by using a stronger original current or a more powerful arrangement of helices  33 a feeble voltaic current was sent through the helix b and the galvanometer so as to deflect the needle of the latter 30° or 40° and then the battery of one hundred pairs of plates connected with a but after the first effect was over the galvanometerneedle resumed exactly the position due to the feeble current transmitted by its own wire this took place in whichever way the battery contacts were made and shows that here again 20 no permanent influence of the currents upon each other as to their quantity and tension exists  34 another arrangement was then employed connecting the former experiments on voltaelectric induction 626 with the present a combination of helices like that already described 6 was constructed upon a hollow cylinder of pasteboard there were eight lengths of copper wire containing altogether 220 feet four of these helices were connected end to end and then with the galvanometer 7 the other intervening four were also connected end to end and the battery of one hundred pairs discharged through them in this form the effect on the galvanometer was hardly sensible 11 though magnets could be made by the induced current 13 but when a soft iron cylinder seven eighths of an inch thick and twelve inches long was introduced into the pasteboard tube surrounded by the helices then the induced current affected the galvanometer powerfully and with all the phenomena just described 30 it possessed also the power of making magnets with more energy apparently than when no iron cylinder was present  35 when the iron cylinder was replaced by an equal cylinder of copper no effect beyond that of the helices alone was produced the iron cylinder arrangement was not so powerful as the ring arrangement already described 27  36 similar effects were then produced by ordinary magnets thus the hollow helix just described 34 had all its elementary helices connected with the galvanometer by two copper wires each five feet in length the soft iron cylinder was introduced into its axis a couple of bar magnets each twentyfour inches long were arranged with their opposite poles at one end in contact so as to resemble a horseshoe magnet and then contact made between the other poles and the ends of the iron cylinder so as to convert it for the time into a magnet fig 2 by breaking the magnetic contacts or reversing them the magnetism of the iron cylinder could be destroyed or reversed at pleasure  37 upon making magnetic contact the needle was deflected continuing the contact the needle became indifferent and resumed its first position on breaking the contact it was again deflected but in the opposite direction to the first effect and then it again became indifferent when the magnetic contacts were reversed the deflections were reversed  38 when the magnetic contact was made the deflection was such as to indicate an induced current of electricity in the opposite direction to that fitted to form a magnet having the same polarity as that really produced by contact with the bar magnets thus when the marked and unmarked poles were placed as in fig 3 the current in the helix was in the direction represented p being supposed to be the end of the wire going to the positive pole of the battery or that end towards which the zinc plates face and n the negative wire such a current would have converted the cylinder into a magnet of the opposite kind to that formed by contact with the poles a and b and such a current moves in the opposite direction to the currents which in m ampères beautiful theory are considered as constituting a magnet in the position figureda    a the relative position of an electric current and a magnet is by   most persons found very difficult to remember and three or four helps   to the memory have been devised by m ampère and others i venture to   suggest the following as a very simple and effectual assistance in   these and similar latitudes let the experimenter think he is looking   down upon a dipping needle or upon the pole of the north and then   let him think upon the direction of the motion of the hands of a   watch or of a screw moving direct currents in that direction round a   needle would make it into such a magnet as the dipping needle or   would themselves constitute an electromagnet of similar qualities or   if brought near a magnet would tend to make it take that direction or   would themselves be moved into that position by a magnet so placed or   in m ampères theory are considered as moving in that direction in   the magnet these two points of the position of the dippingneedle and   the motion of the watch hands being remembered any other relation of   the current and magnet can be at once deduced from it  39 but as it might be supposed that in all the preceding experiments of this section it was by some peculiar effect taking place during the formation of the magnet and not by its mere virtual approximation that the momentary induced current was excited the following experiment was made all the similar ends of the compound hollow helix 34 were bound together by copper wire forming two general terminations and these were connected with the galvanometer the soft iron cylinder 34 was removed and a cylindrical magnet three quarters of an inch in diameter and eight inches and a half in length used instead one end of this magnet was introduced into the axis of the helix fig 4 and then the galvanometerneedle being stationary the magnet was suddenly thrust in immediately the needle was deflected in the same direction as if the magnet had been formed by either of the two preceding processes 34 36 being left in the needle resumed its first position and then the magnet being withdrawn the needle was deflected in the opposite direction these effects were not great but by introducing and withdrawing the magnet so that the impulse each time should be added to those previously communicated to the needle the latter could be made to vibrate through an arc of 180° or more  40 in this experiment the magnet must not be passed entirely through the helix for then a second action occurs when the magnet is introduced the needle at the galvanometer is deflected in a certain direction but being in whether it be pushed quite through or withdrawn the needle is deflected in a direction the reverse of that previously produced when the magnet is passed in and through at one continuous motion the needle moves one way is then suddenly stopped and finally moves the other way  41 if such a hollow helix as that described 34 be laid east and west or in any other constant position and a magnet be retained east and west its marked pole always being one way then whichever end of the helix the magnet goes in at and consequently whichever pole of the magnet enters first still the needle is deflected the same way on the other hand whichever direction is followed in withdrawing the magnet the deflection is constant but contrary to that due to its entrance  42 these effects are simple consequences of the law hereafter to be described 114  43 when the eight elementary helices were made one long helix the effect was not so great as in the arrangement described when only one of the eight helices was used the effect was also much diminished all care was taken to guard against tiny direct action of the inducing magnet upon the galvanometer and it was found that by moving the magnet in the same direction and to the same degree on the outside of the helix no effect on the needle was produced  44 the royal society are in possession of a large compound magnet formerly belonging to dr gowin knight which by permission of the president and council i was allowed to use in the prosecution of these experiments it is at present in the charge of mr christie at his house at woolwich where by mr christies kindness i was at liberty to work and i have to acknowledge my obligations to him for his assistance in all the experiments and observations made with it this magnet is composed of about 450 bar magnets each fifteen inches long one inch wide and half an inch thick arranged in a box so as to present at one of its extremities two external poles fig 5 these poles projected horizontally six inches from the box were each twelve inches high and three inches wide they were nine inches apart and when a soft iron cylinder three quarters of an inch in diameter and twelve inches long was put across from one to the other it required a force of nearly one hundred pounds to break the contact the pole to the left in the figure is the marked polea    a to avoid any confusion as to the poles of the magnet i shall   designate the pole pointing to the north as the marked pole i may   occasionally speak of the north and south ends of the needle but do   not mean thereby north and south poles that is by many considered the   true north pole of a needle which points to the south but in this   country it in often called the south pole  45 the indicating galvanometer in all experiments made with this magnet was about eight feet from it not directly in front of the poles but about 16° or 17° on one side it was found that on making or breaking the connexion of the poles by soft iron the instrument was slightly affected but all error of observation arising from this cause was easily and carefully avoided  46 the electrical effects exhibited by this magnet were very striking when a soft iron cylinder thirteen inches long was put through the compound hollow helix with its ends arranged as two general terminations 39 these connected with the galvanometer and the iron cylinder brought in contact with the two poles of the magnet fig 5 so powerful a rush of electricity took place that the needle whirled round many times in successiona    a a soft iron bar in the form of a lifter to a horseshoe magnet   when supplied with a coil of this kind round the middle of it   becomes by juxtaposition with a magnet a ready source of a brief   but determinate current of electricity  47 notwithstanding this great power if the contact was continued the needle resumed its natural position being entirely uninfluenced by the position of the helix 30 but on breaking the magnetic contact the needle was whirled round in the opposite direction with a force equal to the former  48 a piece of copper plate wrapped once round the iron cylinder like a socket but with interposed paper to prevent contact had its edges connected with the wires of the galvanometer when the iron was brought in contact with the poles the galvanometer was strongly affected  49 dismissing the helices and sockets the galvanometer wire was passed over and consequently only half round the iron cylinder fig 6 but even then a strong effect upon the needle was exhibited when the magnetic contact was made or broken  50 as the helix with its iron cylinder was brought towards the magnetic poles but without making contact still powerful effects were produced when the helix without the iron cylinder and consequently containing no metal but copper was approached to or placed between the poles 44 the needle was thrown 80° 90° or more from its natural position the inductive force was of course greater the nearer the helix either with or without its iron cylinder was brought to the poles but otherwise the same effects were produced whether the helix c was or was not brought into contact with the magnet ie no permanent effect on the galvanometer was produced and the effects of approximation and removal were the reverse of each other 30  51 when a bolt of copper corresponding to the iron cylinder was introduced no greater effect was produced by the helix than without it but when a thick iron wire was substituted the magnetoelectric induction was rendered sensibly greater  52 the direction of the electric current produced in all these experiments with the helix was the same as that already described 38 as obtained with the weaker bar magnets  53 a spiral containing fourteen feet of copper wire being connected with the galvanometer and approximated directly towards the marked pole in the line of its axis affected the instrument strongly the current induced in it was in the reverse direction to the current theoretically considered by m ampère as existing in the magnet 38 or as the current in an electromagnet of similar polarity as the spiral was withdrawn the induced current was reversed  54 a similar spiral had the current of eighty pairs of 4inch plates sent through it so as to form an electromagnet and then the other spiral connected with the galvanometer 58 approximated to it the needle vibrated indicating a current in the galvanometer spiral the reverse of that in the battery spiral 18 26 on withdrawing the latter spiral the needle passed in the opposite direction  55 single wires approximated in certain directions towards the magnetic pole had currents induced in them on their removal the currents were inverted in such experiments the wires should not be removed in directions different to those in which they were approximated for then occasionally complicated and irregular effects are produced the causes of which will be very evident in the fourth part of this paper  56 all attempts to obtain chemical effects by the induced current of electricity failed though the precautions before described 22 and all others that could be thought of were employed neither was any sensation on the tongue or any convulsive effect upon the limbs of a frog produced nor could charcoal or fine wire be ignited 133 but upon repeating the experiments more at leisure at the royal institution with an armed loadstone belonging to professor daniell and capable of lifting about thirty pounds a frog was very powerfully convulsed each time magnetic contact was made at first the convulsions could not be obtained on breaking magnetic contact but conceiving the deficiency of effect was because of the comparative slowness of separation the latter act was effected by a blow and then the frog was convulsed strongly the more instantaneous the union or disunion is effected the more powerful the convulsion i thought also i could perceive the sensation upon the tongue and the flash before the eyes but i could obtain no evidence of chemical decomposition  57 the various experiments of this section prove i think most completely the production of electricity from ordinary magnetism that its intensity should be very feeble and quantity small cannot be considered wonderful when it is remembered that like thermoelectricity it is evolved entirely within the substance of metals retaining all their conducting power but an agent which is conducted along metallic wires in the manner described which whilst so passing possesses the peculiar magnetic actions and force of a current of electricity which can agitate and convulse the limbs of a frog and which finally can produce a sparka by its discharge through charcoal 32 can only be electricity as all the effects can be produced by ferruginous electromagnets 34 there is no doubt that arrangements like the magnets of professors moll henry ten eyke and others in which as many as two thousand pounds have been lifted may be used for these experiments in which case not only a brighter spark may be obtained but wires also ignited and as the current can pass liquids 23 chemical action be produced these effects are still more likely to be obtained when the magnetoelectric arrangements to be explained in the fourth section are excited by the powers of such apparatus    a for a mode of obtaining the spark from the common magnet which i   have found effectual see the philosophical magazine for june 1832 p   5 in the same journal for november 1834 vol v p 349 will be   found a method of obtaining the magnetoelectric spark still simpler   in its principle the use of soft iron being dispensed with   altogetherdec 1838  58 the similarity of action almost amounting to identity between common magnets and either electromagnets or voltaelectric currents is strikingly in accordance with and confirmatory of m ampères theory and furnishes powerful reasons for believing that the action is the same in both cases but as a distinction in language is still necessary i propose to call the agency thus exerted by ordinary magnets magnetoelectric or magnelectric induction 26  59 the only difference which powerfully strikes the attention as existing between voltaelectric and magnetoelectric induction is the suddenness of the former and the sensible time required by the latter but even in this early state of investigation there are circumstances which seem to indicate that upon further inquiry this difference will as a philosophical distinction disappear 68a    a for important additional phenomena and developments of the   induction of electrical currents see now the ninth series   10481118dec 1838   § 3 new electrical state or condition of mattera    a this section having been read at the royal society and reported   upon and having also in consequence of a letter from myself to m   hachette been noticed at the french institute i feel bound to let it   stand as part of the paper but later investigations intimated 73   76 77 of the laws governing those phenomena induce me to think   that the latter can be fully explained without admitting the   electrotonic state my views on this point will appear in the second   series of these researchesmf   60 whilst the wire is subject to either voltaelectric or magnetoelectric induction it appears to be in a peculiar state for it resists the formation of an electrical current in it whereas if in its common condition such a current would be produced and when left uninfluenced it has the power of originating a current a power which the wire does not possess under common circumstances this electrical condition of matter has not hitherto been recognised but it probably exerts a very important influence in many if not most of the phenomena produced by currents of electricity for reasons which will immediately appear 71 i have after advising with several learned friends ventured to designate it as the electroionic state  61 this peculiar condition shows no known electrical effects whilst it continues nor have i yet been able to discover any peculiar powers exerted or properties possessed by matter whilst retained in this state  62 it shows no reaction by attractive or repulsive powers the various experiments which have been made with powerful magnets upon such metals as copper silver and generally those substances not magnetic prove this point for the substances experimented upon if electrical conductors must have acquired this state and yet no evidence of attractive or repulsive powers has been observed i have placed copper and silver discs very delicately suspended on torsion balances in vacuo near to the poles of very powerful magnets yet have not been able to observe the least attractive or repulsive force  63 i have also arranged a fine slip of goldleaf very near to a bar of copper the two being in metallic contact by mercury at their extremities these have been placed in vacuo so that metal rods connected with the extremities of the arrangement should pass through the sides of the vessel into the air i have then moved powerful magnetic poles about this arrangement in various directions the metallic circuit on the outside being sometimes completed by wires and sometimes broken but i never could obtain any sensible motion of the goldleaf either directed to the magnet or towards the collateral bar of copper which must have been as far as induction was concerned in a similar state to itself  64 in some cases it has been supposed that under such circumstances attractive and repulsive forces have been exhibited ie that such bodies have become slightly magnetic but the phenomena now described in conjunction with the confidence we may reasonably repose in m ampères theory of magnetism tend to throw doubt on such cases for if magnetism depend upon the attraction of electrical currents and if the powerful currents at first excited both by voltaelectric and magnetoelectric induction instantly and naturally cease 12 28 47 causing at the same time an entire cessation of magnetic effects at the galvanometer needle then there can be little or no expectation that any substances not partaking of the peculiar relation in which iron nickel and one or two other bodies stand should exhibit magnetoattractive powers it seems far more probable that the extremely feeble permanent effects observed have been due to traces of iron or perhaps some other unrecognised cause not magnetic  65 this peculiar condition exerts no retarding or accelerating power upon electrical currents passing through metal thus circumstanced 20 33 neither could any such power upon the inducing current itself be detected for when masses of metal wires helices c were arranged in all possible ways by the side of a wire or helix carrying a current measured by the galvanometer 20 not the slightest permanent change in the indication of the instrument could be perceived metal in the supposed peculiar state therefore conducts electricity in all directions with its ordinary facility or in other words its conducting power is not sensibly altered by it  66 all metals take on the peculiar state this is proved in the preceding experiments with copper and iron 9 and with gold silver tin lead zinc antimony bismuth mercury c by experiments to be described in the fourth part 132 admitting of easy application with regard to iron the experiments prove the thorough and remarkable independence of these phenomena of induction and the ordinary magnetical appearances of that metal  67 this state is altogether the effect of the induction exerted and ceases as soon as the inductive force is removed it is the same state whether produced by the collateral passage of voltaic currents 26 or the formation of a magnet 34 36 or the mere approximation of a magnet 39 50 and is a strong proof in addition to those advanced by m ampère of the identity of the agents concerned in these several operations it probably occurs momentarily during the passage of the common electric spark 24 and may perhaps be obtained hereafter in bad conductors by weak electrical currents or other means 74 76  68 the state appears to be instantly assumed 12 requiring hardly a sensible portion of time for that purpose the difference of time between voltaelectric and magnetoelectric induction rendered evident by the galvanometer 59 may probably be thus explained when a voltaic current is sent through one of two parallel wires as those of the hollow helix 34 a current is produced in the other wire as brief in its continuance as the time required for a single action of this kind and which by experiment is found to be inappreciably small the action will seem still more instantaneous because as there is an accumulation of power in the poles of the battery before contact the first rush of electricity in the wire of communication is greater than that sustained after the contact is completed the wire of induction becomes at the moment electrotonic to an equivalent degree which the moment after sinks to the state in which the continuous current can sustain it but in sinking causes an opposite induced current to that at first produced the consequence is that the first induced wave of electricity more resembles that from the discharge of an electric jar than it otherwise would do  69 but when the iron cylinder is put into the same helix 31 previous to the connexion being made with the battery then the current from the latter may be considered as active in inducing innumerable currents of a similar kind to itself in the iron rendering it a magnet this is known by experiment to occupy time for a magnet so formed even of soft iron does not rise to its fullest intensity in an instant and it may be because the currents within the iron are successive in their formation or arrangement but as the magnet can induce as well as the battery current the combined action of the two continues to evolve induced electricity until their joint effect is at a maximum and thus the existence of the deflecting force is prolonged sufficiently to overcome the inertia of the galvanometer needle  70 in all those cases where the helices or wires are advanced towards or taken from the magnet 50 55 the direct or inverted current of induced electricity continues for the time occupied in the advance or recession for the electrotonic state is rising to a higher or falling to a lower degree during that time and the change is accompanied by its corresponding evolution of electricity but these form no objections to the opinion that the electrotonic state is instantly assumed  71 this peculiar state appears to be a state of tension and may be considered as equivalent to a current of electricity at least equal to that produced either when the condition is induced or destroyed the current evolved however first or last is not to be considered a measure of the degree of tension to which the electrotonic state has risen for as the metal retains its conducting powers unimpaired 65 and as the electricity evolved is but for a moment the peculiar state being instantly assumed and lost 68 the electricity which may be led away by long wire conductors offering obstruction in their substance proportionate to their small lateral and extensive linear dimensions can be but a very small portion of that really evolved within the mass at the moment it assumes this condition insulated helices and portions of metal instantly assumed the state and no traces of electricity could be discovered in them however quickly the contact with the electrometer was made after they were put under induction either by the current from the battery or the magnet a single drop of water or a small piece of moistened paper 23 56 was obstacle sufficient to stop the current through the conductors the electricity evolved returning to a state of equilibrium through the metal itself and consequently in an unobserved manner  72 the tension of this state may therefore be comparatively very great but whether great or small it is hardly conceivable that it should exist without exerting a reaction upon the original inducing current and producing equilibrium of some kind it might be anticipated that this would give rise to a retardation of the original current but i have not been able to ascertain that this is the case neither have i in any other way as yet been able to distinguish effects attributable to such a reaction  73 all the results favour the notion that the electrotonic state relates to the particles and not to the mass of the wire or substance under induction being in that respect different to the induction exerted by electricity of tension if so the state may be assumed in liquids when no electrical current is sensible and even in nonconductors the current itself when it occurs being as it were a contingency due to the existence of conducting power and the momentary propulsive force exerted by the particles during their arrangement even when conducting power is equal the currents of electricity which as yet are the only indicators of this state may be unequal because of differences as to numbers size electrical condition c c in the particles themselves it will only be after the laws which govern this new state are ascertained that we shall be able to predict what is the true condition of and what are the electrical results obtainable from any particular substance  74 the current of electricity which induces the electrotonic state in a neighbouring wire probably induces that state also in its own wire for when by a current in one wire a collateral wire is made electrotonic the latter state is not rendered any way incompatible or interfering with a current of electricity passing through it 62 if therefore the current were sent through the second wire instead of the first it does not seem probable that its inducing action upon the second would be less but on the contrary more because the distance between the agent and the matter acted upon would be very greatly diminished a copper bolt had its extremities connected with a galvanometer and then the poles of a battery of one hundred pairs of plates connected with the bolt so as to send the current through it the voltaic circuit was then suddenly broken and the galvanometer observed for any indications of a return current through the copper bolt due to the discharge of its supposed electrotonic state no effect of the kind was obtained nor indeed for two reasons ought it to be expected for first as the cessation of induction and the discharge of the electrotonic condition are simultaneous and not successive the return current would only be equivalent to the neutralization of the last portion of the inducing current and would not therefore show any alteration of direction or assuming that time did intervene and that the latter current was really distinct from the former its short sudden character 12 26 would prevent it from being thus recognised  75 no difficulty arises i think in considering the wire thus rendered electrotonic by its own current more than by any external current especially when the apparent noninterference of that state with currents is considered 62 71 the simultaneous existence of the conducting and electrotonic states finds an analogy in the manner in which electrical currents can be passed through magnets where it is found that both the currents passed and those of the magnets preserve all their properties distinct from each other and exert their mutual actions  76 the reason given with regard to metals extends also to fluids and all other conductors and leads to the conclusion that when electric currents are passed through them they also assume the electrotonic state should that prove to be the case its influence in voltaic decomposition and the transference of the elements to the poles can hardly be doubted in the electrotonic state the homogeneous particles of matter appear to have assumed a regular but forced electrical arrangement in the direction of the current which if the matter be undecomposable produces when relieved a return current but in decomposable matter this forced state may be sufficient to make an elementary particle leave its companion with which it is in a constrained condition and associate with the neighbouring similar particle in relation to which it is in a more natural condition the forced electrical arrangement being itself discharged or relieved at the same time as effectually as if it had been freed from induction but as the original voltaic current is continued the electrotonic state may be instantly renewed producing the forced arrangement of the compound particles to be as instantly discharged by a transference of the elementary particles of the opposite kind in opposite directions but parallel to the current even the differences between common and voltaic electricity when applied to effect chemical decomposition which dr wollaston has pointed outa seem explicable by the circumstances connected with the induction of electricity from these two sources 25 but as i have reserved this branch of the inquiry that i might follow out the investigations contained in the present paper i refrain though much tempted from offering further speculations    a philosophical transactions 1801 p 247  77 marianini has discovered and described a peculiar affection of the surfaces of metallic discs when being in contact with humid conductors a current of electricity is passed through them they are then capable of producing a reverse current of electricity and marianini has well applied the effect in explanation of the phenomena of ritters pilesa ma de la rive has described a peculiar property acquired by metallic conductors when being immersed in a liquid as poles they have completed for some time the voltaic circuit in consequence of which when separated from the battery and plunged into the same fluid they by themselves produce an electric currentb ma van beek has detailed cases in which the electrical relation of one metal in contact with another has been preserved after separation and accompanied by its corresponding chemical effectsc these states and results appear to differ from the electrotonic state and its phenomena but the true relation of the former to the latter can only be decided when our knowledge of all these phenomena has been enlarged    a annales de chimie xxxviii 5    b ibid xxviii 190    c ibid xxxviii 49  78 i had occasion in the commencement of this paper 2 to refer to an experiment by ampère as one of those dependent upon the electrical induction of currents made prior to the present investigation and have arrived at conclusions which seem to imply doubts of the accuracy of the experiment 62 c it is therefore due to m ampère that i should attend to it more distinctly when a disc of copper says m ampère was suspended by a silk thread and surrounded by a helix or spiral and when the charge of a powerful voltaic battery was sent through the spiral a strong magnet at the same time being presented to the copper disc the latter turned at the moment to take a position of equilibrium exactly as the spiral itself would have turned had it been free to move i have not been able to obtain this effect nor indeed any motion but the cause of my failure in the latter point may be due to the momentary existence of the current not allowing time for the inertia of the plate to be overcome 11 12 m ampère has perhaps succeeded in obtaining motion from the superior delicacy and power of his electromagnetical apparatus or he may have obtained only the motion due to cessation of action but all my results tend to invert the sense of the proposition stated by m ampère that a current of electricity tends to put the electricity of conductors near which it passes in motion in the same direction for they indicate an opposite direction for the produced current 26 53 and they show that the effect is momentary and that it is also produced by magnetic induction and that certain other extraordinary effects follow thereupon  79 the momentary existence of the phenomena of induction now described is sufficient to furnish abundant reasons for the uncertainty or failure of the experiments hitherto made to obtain electricity from magnets or to effect chemical decomposition or arrangement by their meansa    a the lycée no 36 for january 1st has a long and rather   premature article in which it endeavours to show anticipations by   french philosophers of my researches it however mistakes the   erroneous results of mm fresnel and ampère for true ones and then   imagines my true results are like those erroneous ones i notice it   here however for the purpose of doing honour to fresnel in a much   higher degree than would have been merited by a feeble anticipation of   the present investigations that great philosopher at the same time   with myself and fifty other persons made experiments which the   present paper proves could give no expected result he was deceived   for the moment and published his imaginary success but on more   carefully repeating his trials he could find no proof of their   accuracy and in the high and pure philosophic desire to remove error   as well as discover truth he recanted his first statement the   example of berzelius regarding the first thorina is another instance   of this fine feeling and as occasions are not rare it would be to   the dignity of science if such examples were more frequently   followedfebruary 10th 1832  80 it also appears capable of explaining fully the remarkable phenomena observed by m arago between metals and magnets when neither are moving 120 as well as most of the results obtained by sir john herschel messrs babbage harris and others in repeating his experiments accounting at the same time perfectly for what at first appeared inexplicable namely the nonaction of the same metals and magnets when at rest these results which also afford the readiest means of obtaining electricity from magnetism i shall now proceed to describe   § 4 explication of aragos magnetic phenomena   81 if a plate of copper be revolved close to a magnetic needle or magnet suspended in such a way that the latter may rotate in a plane parallel to that of the former the magnet tends to follow the motion of the plate or if the magnet be revolved the plate tends to follow its motion and the effect is so powerful that magnets or plates of many pounds weight may be thus carried round if the magnet and plate be at rest relative to each other not the slightest effect attractive or repulsive or of any kind can be observed between them 62 this is the phenomenon discovered by m arago and he states that the effect takes place not only with all metals but with solids liquids and even gases ie with all substances 130  82 mr babbage and sir john herschel on conjointly repeating the experiments in this countrya could obtain the effects only with the metals and with carbon in a peculiar state from gas retorts ie only with excellent conductors of electricity they refer the effect to magnetism induced in the plate by the magnet the pole of the latter causing an opposite pole in the nearest part of the plate and round this a more diffuse polarity of its own kind 120 the essential circumstance in producing the rotation of the suspended magnet is that the substance revolving below it shall acquire and lose its magnetism in sensible time and not instantly 124 this theory refers the effect to an attractive force and is not agreed to by the discoverer m arago nor by m ampère who quote against it the absence of all attraction when the magnet and metal are at rest 62 126 although the induced magnetism should still remain and who from experiments made with a long dipping needle conceive the action to be always repulsive 125    a philosophical transactions 1825 p 467  83 upon obtaining electricity from magnets by the means already described 36 46 i hoped to make the experiment of m arago a new source of electricity and did not despair by reference to terrestrial magnetoelectric induction of being able to construct a new electrical machine thus stimulated numerous experiments were made with the magnet of the royal society at mr christies house in all of which i had the advantage of his assistance as many of these were in the course of the superseded by more perfect arrangements i shall consider myself at liberty investigation to rearrange them in a manner calculated to convey most readily what appears to me to be a correct view of the nature of the phenomena  84 the magnet has been already described 44 to concentrate the poles and bring them nearer to each other two iron or steel bars each about six or seven inches long one inch wide and half an inch thick were put across the poles as in fig 7 and being supported by twine from slipping could be placed as near to or far from each other as was required occasionally two bars of soft iron were employed so bent that when applied one to each pole the two smaller resulting poles were vertically over each other either being uppermost at pleasure  85 a disc of copper twelve inches in diameter and about one fifth of an inch in thickness fixed upon a brass axis was mounted in frames so as to allow of revolution either vertically or horizontally its edge being at the same time introduced more or less between the magnetic poles fig 7 the edge of the plate was well amalgamated for the purpose of obtaining a good but moveable contact and a part round the axis was also prepared in a similar manner  86 conductors or electric collectors of copper and lead were constructed so as to come in contact with the edge of the copper disc 85 or with other forms of plates hereafter to be described 101 these conductors were about four inches long one third of an inch wide and one fifth of an inch thick one end of each was slightly grooved to allow of more exact adaptation to the somewhat convex edge of the plates and then amalgamated copper wires one sixteenth of an inch in thickness attached in the ordinary manner by convolutions to the other ends of these conductors passed away to the galvanometer  87 the galvanometer was roughly made yet sufficiently delicate in its indications the wire was of copper covered with silk and made sixteen or eighteen convolutions two sewingneedles were magnetized and fixed on to a stem of dried grass parallel to each other but in opposite directions and about half an inch apart this system was suspended by a fibre of unspun silk so that the lower needle should be between the convolutions of the multiplier and the upper above them the latter was by much the most powerful magnet and gave terrestrial direction to the whole fig 8 represents the direction of the wire and of the needles when the instrument was placed in the magnetic meridian the ends of the wires are marked a and b for convenient reference hereafter the letters s and n designate the south and north ends of the needle when affected merely by terrestrial magnetism the end n is therefore the marked pole 44 the whole instrument was protected by a glass jar and stood as to position and distance relative to the large magnet under the same circumstances as before 45  88 all these arrangements being made the copper disc was adjusted as in fig 7 the small magnetic poles being about half an inch apart and the edge of the plate inserted about half their width between them one of the galvanometer wires was passed twice or thrice loosely round the brass axis of the plate and the other attached to a conductor 86 which itself was retained by the hand in contact with the amalgamated edge of the disc at the part immediately between the magnetic poles under these circumstances all was quiescent and the galvanometer exhibited no effect but the instant the plate moved the galvanometer was influenced and by revolving the plate quickly the needle could be deflected 90° or more  89 it was difficult under the circumstances to make the contact between the conductor and the edge of the revolving disc uniformly good and extensive it was also difficult in the first experiments to obtain a regular velocity of rotation both these causes tended to retain the needle in a continual state of vibration but no difficulty existed in ascertaining to which side it was deflected or generally about what line it vibrated afterwards when the experiments were made more carefully a permanent deflection of the needle of nearly 45° could be sustained  90 here therefore was demonstrated the production of a permanent current of electricity by ordinary magnets 57  91 when the motion of the disc was reversed every other circumstance remaining the same the galvanometer needle was deflected with equal power as before but the deflection was on the opposite side and the current of electricity evolved therefore the reverse of the former  92 when the conductor was placed on the edge of the disc a little to the right or left as in the dotted positions fig 9 the current of electricity was still evolved and in the same direction as at first 88 91 this occurred to a considerable distance ie 50° or 60° on each side of the place of the magnetic poles the current gathered by the conductor and conveyed to the galvanometer was of the same kind on both sides of the place of greatest intensity but gradually diminished in force from that place it appeared to be equally powerful at equal distances from the place of the magnetic poles not being affected in that respect by the direction of the rotation when the rotation of the disc was reversed the direction of the current of electricity was reversed also but the other circumstances were not affected  93 on raising the plate so that the magnetic poles were entirely hidden from each other by its intervention a fig 10 the same effects were produced in the same order and with equal intensity as before on raising it still higher so as to bring the place of the poles to c still the effects were produced and apparently with as much power as at first  94 when the conductor was held against the edge as if fixed to it and with it moved between the poles even though but for a few degrees the galvanometer needle moved and indicated a current of electricity the same as that which would have been produced if the wheel had revolved in the same direction the conductor remaining stationary  95 when the galvanometer connexion with the axis was broken and its wires made fast to two conductors both applied to the edge of the copper disc then currents of electricity were produced presenting more complicated appearances but in perfect harmony with the above results thus if applied as in fig 11 a current of electricity through the galvanometer was produced but if their place was a little shifted as in fig 12 a current in the contrary direction resulted the fact being that in the first instance the galvanometer indicated the difference between a strong current through a and a weak one through b and in the second of a weak current through a and a strong one through b 92 and therefore produced opposite deflections  96 so also when the two conductors were equidistant from the magnetic poles as in fig 13 no current at the galvanometer was perceived whichever way the disc was rotated beyond what was momentarily produced by irregularity of contact because equal currents in the same direction tended to pass into both but when the two conductors were connected with one wire and the axis with the other wire fig 14 then the galvanometer showed a current according with the direction of rotation 91 both conductors now acting consentaneously and as a single conductor did before 88  97 all these effects could be obtained when only one of the poles of the magnet was brought near to the plate they were of the same kind as to direction c but by no means so powerful  98 all care was taken to render these results independent of the earths magnetism or of the mutual magnetism of the magnet and galvanometer needles the contacts were made in the magnetic equator of the plate and at other parts the plate was placed horizontally and the poles vertically and other precautions were taken but the absence of any interference of the kind referred to was readily shown by the want of all effect when the disc was removed from the poles or the poles from the disc every other circumstance remaining the same  99 the relation of the current of electricity produced to the magnetic pole to the direction of rotation of the plate c c may be expressed by saying that when the unmarked pole 44 84 is beneath the edge of the plate and the latter revolves horizontally screwfashion the electricity which can be collected at the edge of the plate nearest to the pole is positive as the pole of the earth may mentally be considered the unmarked pole this relation of the rotation the pole and the electricity evolved is not difficult to remember or if in fig 15 the circle represent the copper disc revolving in the direction of the arrows and a the outline of the unmarked pole placed beneath the plate then the electricity collected at b and the neighbouring parts is positive whilst that collected at the centre c and other parts is negative 88 the currents in the plate are therefore from the centre by the magnetic poles towards the circumference  100 if the marked pole be placed above all other things remaining the same the electricity at b fig 15 is still positive if the marked pole be placed below or the unmarked pole above the electricity is reversed if the direction of revolution in any case is reversed the electricity is also reversed  101 it is now evident that the rotating plate is merely another form of the simpler experiment of passing a piece of metal between the magnetic poles in a rectilinear direction and that in such cases currents of electricity are produced at right angles to the direction of the motion and crossing it at the place of the magnetic pole or poles this was sufficiently shown by the following simple experiment a piece of copper plate one fifth of an inch thick one inch and a half wide and twelve inches long being amalgamated at the edges was placed between the magnetic poles whilst the two conductors from the galvanometer were held in contact with its edges it was then drawn through between the poles of the conductors in the direction of the arrow fig 16 immediately the galvanometer needle was deflected its north or marked end passed eastward indicating that the wire a received negative and the wire b positive electricity and as the marked pole was above the result is in perfect accordance with the effect obtained by the rotatory plate 99  102 on reversing the motion of the plate the needle at the galvanometer was deflected in the opposite direction showing an opposite current  103 to render evident the character of the electrical current existing in various parts of the moving copper plate differing in their relation to the inducing poles one collector 86 only was applied at the part to be examined near to the pole the other being connected with the end of the plate as the most neutral place the results are given at fig 1720 the marked pole being above the plate in fig 17 b received positive electricity but the plate moving in the same direction it received on the opposite side fig 18 negative electricity reversing the motion of the latter as in fig 20 b received positive electricity or reversing the motion of the first arrangement that of fig 17 to fig 19 b received negative electricity  104 when the plates were previously removed sideways from between the magnets as in fig 21 so as to be quite out of the polar axis still the same effects were produced though not so strongly  105 when the magnetic poles were in contact and the copper plate was drawn between the conductors near to the place there was but very little effect produced when the poles were opened by the width of a card the effect was somewhat more but still very small  106 when an amalgamated copper wire one eighth of an inch thick was drawn through between the conductors and poles 101 it produced a very considerable effect though not so much as the plates  107 if the conductors were held permanently against any particular parts of the copper plates and carried between the magnetic poles with them effects the same as those described were produced in accordance with the results obtained with the revolving disc 94  108 on the conductors being held against the ends of the plates and the latter then passed between the magnetic poles in a direction transverse to their length the same effects were produced fig 22 the parts of the plates towards the end may be considered either as mere conductors or as portions of metal in which the electrical current is excited according to their distance and the strength of the magnet but the results were in perfect harmony with those before obtained the effect was as strong as when the conductors were held against the sides of the plate 101  109 when a mere wire connected with the galvanometer so as to form a complete circuit was passed through between the poles the galvanometer was affected and upon moving the wire to and fro so as to make the alternate impulses produced correspond with the vibrations of the needle the latter could be increased to 20° or 30° on each side the magnetic meridian  110 upon connecting the ends of a plate of metal with the galvanometer wires and then carrying it between the poles from end to end as in fig 23 in either direction no effect whatever was produced upon the galvanometer but the moment the motion became transverse the needle was deflected  111 these effects were also obtained from electromagnetic poles resulting from the use of copper helices or spirals either alone or with iron cores 34 54 the directions of the motions were precisely the same but the action was much greater when the iron cores were used than without  112 when a flat spiral was passed through edgewise between the poles a curious action at the galvanometer resulted the needle first went strongly one way but then suddenly stopped as if it struck against some solid obstacle and immediately returned if the spiral were passed through from above downwards or from below upwards still the motion of the needle was in the same direction then suddenly stopped and then was reversed but on turning the spiral halfway round ie edge for edge then the directions of the motions were reversed but still were suddenly interrupted and inverted as before this double action depends upon the halves of the spiral divided by a line passing through its centre perpendicular to the direction of its motion acting in opposite directions and the reason why the needle went to the same side whether the spiral passed by the poles in the one or the other direction was the circumstance that upon changing the motion the direction of the wires in the approaching half of the spiral was changed also the effects curious as they appear when witnessed are immediately referable to the action of single wires 40 109  113 although the experiments with the revolving plate wires and plates of metal were first successfully made with the large magnet belonging to the royal society yet they were all ultimately repeated with a couple of bar magnets two feet long one inch and a half wide and half an inch thick and by rendering the galvanometer 87 a little more delicate with the most striking results ferroelectromagnets as those of moll henry c 57 are very powerful it is very essential when making experiments on different substances that thermoelectric effects produced by contact of the fingers c be avoided or at least appreciated and accounted for they are easily distinguished by their permanency and their independence of the magnets or of the direction of the motion  114 the relation which holds between the magnetic pole the moving wire or metal and the direction of the current evolved ie the law which governs the evolution of electricity by magnetoelectric induction is very simple although rather difficult to express if in fig 24 pn represent a horizontal wire passing by a marked magnetic pole so that the direction of its motion shall coincide with the curved line proceeding from below upwards or if its motion parallel to itself be in a line tangential to the curved line but in the general direction of the arrows or if it pass the pole in other directions but so as to cut the magnetic curvesa in the same general direction or on the same side as they would be cut by the wire if moving along the dotted curved linethen the current of electricity in the wire is from p to n if it be carried in the reverse directions the electric current will be from n to p or if the wire be in the vertical position figured p n and it be carried in similar directions coinciding with the dotted horizontal curve so far as to cut the magnetic curves on the same side with it the current will be from p to n if the wire be considered a tangent to the curved surface of the cylindrical magnet and it be carried round that surface into any other position or if the magnet itself be revolved on its axis so as to bring any part opposite to the tangential wirestill if afterwards the wire be moved in the directions indicated the current of electricity will be from p to n or if it be moved in the opposite direction from n to p so that as regards the motions of the wire past the pole they may be reduced to two directly opposite to each other one of which produces a current from p to n and the other from n to p    a by magnetic curves i mean the lines of magnetic forces however   modified by the juxtaposition of poles which would be depicted by   iron filings or those to which a very small magnetic needle would   form a tangent  115 the same holds true of the unmarked pole of the magnet except that if it be substituted for the one in the figure then as the wires are moved in the direction of the arrows the current of electricity would be from n to p and when they move in the reverse direction from p to n  116 hence the current of electricity which is excited in metal when moving in the neighbourhood of a magnet depends for its direction altogether upon the relation of the metal to the resultant of magnetic action or to the magnetic curves and may be expressed in a popular way thus let ab fig 25 represent a cylinder magnet a being the marked pole and b the unmarked pole let pn be a silver knifeblade resting across the magnet with its edge upward and with its marked or notched side towards the pole a then in whatever direction or position this knife be moved edge foremost either about the marked or the unmarked pole the current of electricity produced will be from p to n provided the intersected curves proceeding from a abut upon the notched surface of the knife and those from b upon the unnotched side or if the knife be moved with its back foremost the current will be from n to p in every possible position and direction provided the intersected curves abut on the same surfaces as before a little model is easily constructed by using a cylinder of wood for a magnet a flat piece for the blade and a piece of thread connecting one end of the cylinder with the other and passing through a hole in the blade for the magnetic curves this readily gives the result of any possible direction  117 when the wire under induction is passing by an electromagnetic pole as for instance one end of a copper helix traversed by the electric current 34 the direction of the current in the approaching wire is the same with that of the current in the parts or sides of the spirals nearest to it and in the receding wire the reverse of that in the parts nearest to it  118 all these results show that the power of inducing electric currents is circumferentially exerted by a magnetic resultant or axis of power just as circumferential magnetism is dependent upon and is exhibited by an electric current  119 the experiments described combine to prove that when a piece of metal and the same may be true of all conducting matter 213  is passed either before a single pole or between the opposite poles of a magnet or near electromagnetic poles whether ferruginous or not electrical currents are produced across the metal transverse to the direction of motion and which therefore in aragos experiments will approximate towards the direction of radii if a single wire be moved like the spoke of a wheel near a magnetic pole a current of electricity is determined through it from one end towards the other if a wheel be imagined constructed of a great number of these radii and this revolved near the pole in the manner of the copper disc 85 each radius will have a current produced in it as it passes by the pole if the radii be supposed to be in contact laterally a copper disc results in which the directions of the currents will be generally the same being modified only by the coaction which can take place between the particles now that they are in metallic contact  120 now that the existence of these currents is known aragos phenomena may be accounted for without considering them as due to the formation in the copper of a pole of the opposite kind to that approximated surrounded by a diffuse polarity of the same kind 82 neither is it essential that the plate should acquire and lose its state in a finite time nor on the other hand does it seem necessary that any repulsive force should be admitted as the cause of the rotation 82  121 the effect is precisely of the same kind as the electromagnetic rotations which i had the good fortune to discover some years agoa according to the experiments then made which have since been abundantly confirmed if a wire pn fig 26 be connected with the positive and negative ends of a voltaic buttery so that the positive electricity shall pass from p to n and a marked magnetic pole n be placed near the wire between it and the spectator the pole will move in a direction tangential to the wire ie towards the right and the wire will move tangentially towards the left according to the directions of the arrows this is exactly what takes place in the rotation of a plate beneath a magnetic pole for let n fig 27 be a marked pole above the circular plate the latter being rotated in the direction of the arrow immediately currents of positive electricity set from the central parts in the general direction of the radii by the pole to the parts of the circumference a on the other side of that pole 99 119 and are therefore exactly in the same relation to it as the current in the wire pn fig 26 and therefore the pole in the same manner moves to the right hand    a quarterly journal of science vol xii pp 74 186 416 283  122 if the rotation of the disc be reversed the electric currents are reversed 91 and the pole therefore moves to the left hand if the contrary pole be employed the effects are the same ie in the same direction because currents of electricity the reverse of those described are produced and by reversing both poles and currents the visible effects remain unchanged in whatever position the axis of the magnet be placed provided the same pole be applied to the same side of the plate the electric current produced is in the same direction in consistency with the law already stated 114 c and thus every circumstance regarding the direction of the motion may be explained  123 these currents are discharged or return in the parts of the plate on each side of and more distant from the place of the pole where of course the magnetic induction is weaker and when the collectors are applied and a current of electricity is carried away to the galvanometer 88 the deflection there is merely a repetition by the same current or part of it of the effect of rotation in the magnet over the plate itself  124 it is under the point of view just put forth that i have ventured to say it is not necessary that the plate should acquire and lose its state in a finite time 120 for if it were possible for the current to be fully developed the instant before it arrived at its state of nearest approximation to the vertical pole of the magnet instead of opposite to or a little beyond it still the relative motion of the pole and plate would be the same the resulting force being in fact tangential instead of direct  125 but it is possible though not necessary for the rotation that time may be required for the development of the maximum current in the plate in which case the resultant of all the forces would be in advance of the magnet when the plate is rotated or in the rear of the magnet when the latter is rotated and many of the effects with pure electromagnetic poles tend to prove this is the case then the tangential force may be resolved into two others one parallel to the plane of rotation and the other perpendicular to it the former would be the force exerted in making the plate revolve with the magnet or the magnet with the plate the latter would be a repulsive force and is probably that the effects of which m arago has also discovered 82  126 the extraordinary circumstance accompanying this action which has seemed so inexplicable namely the cessation of all phenomena when the magnet and metal are brought to rest now receives a full explanation 82 for then the electrical currents which cause the motion cease altogether  127 all the effects of solution of metallic continuity and the consequent diminution of power described by messrs babbage and herschela now receive their natural explanation as well also as the resumption of power when the cuts were filled up by metallic substances which though conductors of electricity were themselves very deficient in the power of influencing magnets and new modes of cutting the plate may be devised which shall almost entirely destroy its power thus if a copper plate 81 be cut through at about a fifth or sixth of its diameter from the edge so as to separate a ring from it and this ring be again fastened on but with a thickness of paper intervening fig 29 and if aragos experiment be made with this compound plate so adjusted that the section shall continually travel opposite the pole it is evident that the magnetic currents will be greatly interfered with and the plate probably lose much of its effectb    a philosophical transactions 1825 p 481    b this experiment has actually been made by mr christie with the   results here described and is recorded in the philosophical   transactions for 1827 p 82  an elementary result of this kind was obtained by using two pieces of thick copper shaped as in fig 28 when the two neighbouring edges were amalgamated and put together and the arrangement passed between the poles of the magnet in the direction parallel to these edges a current was urged through the wires attached to the outer angles and the galvanometer became strongly affected but when a single film of paper was interposed and the experiment repeated no sensible effect could be produced  128 a section of this kind could not interfere much with the induction of magnetism supposed to be of the nature ordinarily received by iron  129 the effect of rotation or deflection of the needle which m arago obtained by ordinary magnets m ampère succeeded in procuring by electromagnets this is perfectly in harmony with the results relative to voltaelectric and magnetoelectric induction described in this paper and by using flat spirals of copper wire through which electric currents were sent in place of ordinary magnetic poles ill sometimes applying a single one to one side of the rotating plate and sometimes two to opposite sides i obtained the induced currents of electricity from the plate itself and could lead them away to and ascertain their existence by the galvanometer  130 the cause which has now been assigned for the rotation in aragos experiment namely the production of electrical currents seems abundantly sufficient in all cases where the metals or perhaps even other conductors are concerned but with regard to such bodies as glass resins and above all gases it seems impossible that currents of electricity capable of producing these effects should be generated in them yet arago found that the effects in question were produced by these and by all bodies tried 81 messrs babbage and herschel it is true did not observe them with any substance not metallic except carbon in a highly conducting state 82 mr harris has ascertained their occurrence with wood marble freestone and annealed glass but obtained no effect with sulphuric acid and saturated solution of sulphate of iron although these are better conductors of electricity than the former substances  131 future investigations will no doubt explain these difficulties and decide the point whether the retarding or dragging action spoken of is always simultaneous with electric currentsa the existence of the action in metals only whilst the currents exist ie whilst motion is given 82 88 and the explication of the repulsive action observed by m arago 82 125 are powerful reasons for referring it to this cause but it may be combined with others which occasionally act alone    a experiments which i have since made convince me that this   particular action is always due to the electrical currents formed and   they supply a test by which it may be distinguished from the action of   ordinary magnetism or any other cause including those which are   mechanical or irregular producing similar effects 254  132 copper iron tin zinc lead mercury and all the metals tried produced electrical currents when passed between the magnetic poles the mercury was put into a glass tube for the purpose the dense carbon deposited in coal gas retorts also produced the current but ordinary charcoal did not neither could i obtain any sensible effects with brine sulphuric acid saline solutions c whether rotated in basins or inclosed in tubes and passed between the poles  133 i have never been able to produce any sensation upon the tongue by the wires connected with the conductors applied to the edges of the revolving plate 88 or slips of metal 101 nor have i been able to heat a fine platina wire or produce a spark or convulse the limbs of a frog i have failed also to produce any chemical effects by electricity thus evolved 22 56  134 as the electric current in the revolving copper plate occupies but a small space proceeding by the poles and being discharged right and left at very small distances comparatively 123 and as it exists in a thick mass of metal possessing almost the highest conducting power of any and consequently offering extraordinary facility for its production and discharge and as notwithstanding this considerable currents may be drawn off which can pass through narrow wires forty fifty sixty or even one hundred feet long it is evident that the current existing in the plate itself must be a very powerful one when the rotation is rapid and the magnet strong this is also abundantly proved by the obedience and readiness with which a magnet ten or twelve pounds in weight follows the motion of the plate and will strongly twist up the cord by which it is suspended  135 two rough trials were made with the intention of constructing magnetoelectric machines in one a ring one inch and a half broad and twelve inches external diameter cut from a thick copper plate was mounted so as to revolve between the poles of the magnet and represent a plate similar to those formerly used 101 but of interminable length the inner and outer edges were amalgamated and the conductors applied one to each edge at the place of the magnetic poles the current of electricity evolved did not appear by the galvanometer to be stronger if so strong as that from the circular plate 88  136 in the other small thick discs of copper or other metal half an inch in diameter were revolved rapidly near to the poles but with the axis of rotation out of the polar axis the electricity evolved was collected by conductors applied as before to the edges 86 currents were procured but of strength much inferior to that produced by the circular plate  137 the latter experiment is analogous to those made by mr barlow with a rotating iron shell subject to the influence of the eartha the effects obtained by him have been referred by messrs babbage and herschel to the same cause as that considered as influential in aragos experimentb but it would be interesting to know how far the electric current which might be produced in the experiment would account for the deflexion of the needle the mere inversion of a copper wire six or seven times near the poles of the magnet and isochronously with the vibrations of the galvanometer needle connected with it was sufficient to make the needle vibrate through an arc of 60° or 70° the rotation of a copper shell would perhaps decide the point and might even throw light upon the more permanent though somewhat analogous effects obtained by mr christie    a philosophical transactions 1825 p 317    b ibid 1825 p 485  138 the remark which has already been made respecting iron 66 and the independence of the ordinary magnetical phenomena of that substance and the phenomena now described of magnetoelectric induction in that and other metals was fully confirmed by many results of the kind detailed in this section when an iron plate similar to the copper one formerly described 101 was passed between the magnetic poles it gave a current of electricity like the copper plate but decidedly of less power and in the experiments upon the induction of electric currents 9 no difference in the kind of action between iron and other metals could be perceived the power therefore of an iron plate to drag a magnet after it or to intercept magnetic action should be carefully distinguished from the similar power of such metals as silver copper c c inasmuch as in the iron by far the greater part of the effect is due to what may be called ordinary magnetic action there can be no doubt that the cause assigned by messrs babbage and herschel in explication of aragos phenomena is the true one when iron is the metal used  139 the very feeble powers which were found by those philosophers to belong to bismuth and antimony when moving of affecting the suspended magnet and which has been confirmed by mr harris seem at first disproportionate to their conducting powers whether it be so or not must be decided by future experiment 73a these metals are highly crystalline and probably conduct electricity with different degrees of facility in different directions and it is not unlikely that where a mass is made up of a number of crystals heterogeneously associated an effect approaching to that of actual division may occur 127 or the currents of electricity may become more suddenly deflected at the confines of similar crystalline arrangements and so be more readily and completely discharged within the mass    a i have since been able to explain these differences and prove   with several metals that the effect is in the order of the conducting   power for i have been able to obtain by magnetoelectric induction   currents of electricity which are proportionate in strength to the   conducting power of the bodies experimented with 211  § royal institution november 1831  notein consequence of the long period which has intervened between the reading and printing of the foregoing paper accounts of the experiments have been dispersed and through a letter of my own to m hachette have reached france and italy that letter was translated with some errors and read to the academy of sciences at paris 26th december 1831 a copy of it in le temps of the 28th december quickly reached signor nobili who with signor antinori immediately experimented upon the subject and obtained many of the results mentioned in my letter others they could not obtain or understand because of the brevity of my account these results by signori nobili and antinori have been embodied in a paper dated 31st january 1832 and printed and published in the number of the antologia dated november 1831 according at least to the copy of the paper kindly sent me by signor nobili it is evident the work could not have been then printed and though signor nobili in his paper has inserted my letter as the text of his experiments yet the circumstance of back date has caused many here who have heard of nobilis experiments by report only to imagine his results were anterior to instead of being dependent upon mine  i may be allowed under these circumstances to remark that i experimented on this subject several years ago and have published results see quarterly journal of science for july 1825 p 338 the following also is an extract from my notebook dated november 28 1825 experiments on induction by connecting wire of voltaic batterya battery of four troughs ten pairs of plates each arranged side by sidethe poles connected by a wire about four feet long parallel to which was another similar wire separated from it only by two thicknesses of paper the ends of the latter were attached to a galvanometerexhibited no action c c ccould not in any way render any induction evident from the connecting wire the cause of failure at that time is now evident 79mf april 1832     second series  the bakerian lecture   § 5 terrestrial magnetoelectric induction § 6 force and direction of magnetoelectric induction generally  read january 12 1832   § 5 terrestrial magnetoelectric induction  140 when the general facts described in the former paper were discovered and the law of magnetoelectric induction relative to direction was ascertained 114 it was not difficult to perceive that the earth would produce the same effect as a magnet and to an extent that would perhaps render it available in the construction of new electrical machines the following are some of the results obtained in pursuance of this view  141 the hollow helix already described 6 was connected with a galvanometer by wires eight feet long and the soft iron cylinder 34 after being heated redhot and slowly cooled to remove all traces of magnetism was put into the helix so as to project equally at both ends and fixed there the combined helix and bar were held in the magnetic direction or line of dip and the galvanometer needle being motionless were then inverted so that the lower end should become the upper but the whole still correspond to the magnetic direction the needle was immediately deflected as the latter returned to its first position the helix and bar were again inverted and by doing this two or three times making the inversions and vibrations to coincide the needle swung through an arc of 150° or 160°  142 when one end of the helix which may be called a was uppermost at first b end consequently being below then it mattered not in which direction it proceeded during the inversion whether to the right hand or left hand or through any other course still the galvanometer needle passed in the same direction again when b end was uppermost the inversion of the helix and bar in any direction always caused the needle to be deflected one way that way being the opposite to the course of the deflection in the former case  143 when the helix with its iron core in any given position was inverted the effect was as if a magnet with its marked pole downwards had been introduced from above into the inverted helix thus if the end b were upwards such a magnet introduced from above would make the marked end of the galvanometer needle pass west or the end b being downwards and the soft iron in its place inversion of the whole produced the same effect  144 when the soft iron bar was taken out of the helix and inverted in various directions within four feet of the galvanometer not the slightest effect upon it was produced  145 these phenomena are the necessary consequence of the inductive magnetic power of the earth rendering the soft iron cylinder a magnet with its marked pole downwards the experiment is analogous to that in which two bar magnets were used to magnetize the same cylinder in the same helix 36 and the inversion of position in the present experiment is equivalent to a change of the poles in that arrangement but the result is not less an instance of the evolution of electricity by means of the magnetism of the globe  146 the helix alone was then held permanently in the magnetic direction and the soft iron cylinder afterwards introduced the galvanometer needle was instantly deflected by withdrawing the cylinder as the needle returned and continuing the two actions simultaneously the vibrations soon extended through an arc of 180° the effect was precisely the same as that obtained by using a cylinder magnet with its marked pole downwards and the direction of motion c was perfectly in accordance with the results of former experiments obtained with such a magnet 39 a magnet in that position being used gave the same deflections but stronger when the helix was put at right angles to the magnetic direction or dip then the introduction or removal of the soft iron cylinder produced no effect at the needle any inclination to the dip gave results of the same kind as those already described but increasing in strength as the helix approximated to the direction of the dip  147 a cylinder magnet although it has great power of affecting the galvanometer when moving into or out of the helix has no power of continuing the deflection 39 and therefore though left in still the magnetic needle comes to its usual place of rest but upon repeating with the magnet the experiment of inversion in the direction of the dip 141 the needle was affected as powerfully as before the disturbance of the magnetism in the steel magnet by the earths inductive force upon it being thus shown to be nearly if not quite equal in amount and rapidity to that occurring in soft iron it is probable that in this way magnetoelectrical arrangements may become very useful in indicating the disturbance of magnetic forces where other means will not apply for it is not the whole magnetic power which produces the visible effect but only the difference due to the disturbing causes  148 these favourable results led me to hope that the direct magnetoelectric induction of the earth might be rendered sensible and i ultimately succeeded in obtaining the effect in several ways when the helix just referred to 141 6 was placed in the magnetic dip but without any cylinder of iron or steel and was then inverted a feeble action at the needle was observed inverting the helix ten or twelve times and at such periods that the deflecting forces exerted by the currents of electricity produced in it should be added to the momentum of the needle 39 the latter was soon made to vibrate through an arc of 80° or 90° here therefore currents of electricity were produced by the direct inductive power of the earths magnetism without the use of any ferruginous matter and upon a metal not capable of exhibiting any of the ordinary magnetic phenomena the experiment in everything represents the effects produced by bringing the same helix to one or both poles of any powerful magnet 50  149 guided by the law already expressed 114 i expected that all the electric phenomena of the revolving metal plate could now be produced without any other magnet than the earth the plate so often referred to 85 was therefore fixed so as to rotate in a horizontal plane the magnetic curves of the earth 114 note ie the dip passes through this plane at angles of about 70° which it was expected would be an approximation to perpendicularity quite enough to allow of magnetoelectric induction sufficiently powerful to produce a current of electricity  150 upon rotation of the plate the currents ought according to the law 114 121 to tend to pass in the direction of the radii through all parts of the plate either from the centre to the circumference or from the circumference to the centre as the direction of the rotation of the plate was one way or the other one of the wires of the galvanometer was therefore brought in contact with the axis of the plate and the other attached to a leaden collector or conductor 86 which itself was placed against the amalgamated edge of the disc on rotating the plate there was a distinct effect at the galvanometer needle on reversing the rotation the needle went in the opposite direction and by making the action of the plate coincide with the vibrations of the needle the arc through which the latter passed soon extended to half a circle  151 whatever part of the edge of the plate was touched by the conductor the electricity was the same provided the direction of rotation continued unaltered  152 when the plate revolved screwfashion or as the hands of a watch the current of electricity 150 was from the centre to the circumference when the direction of rotation was unscrew the current was from the circumference to the centre these directions are the same with those obtained when the unmarked pole of a magnet was placed beneath the revolving plate 99  153 when the plate was in the magnetic meridian or in any other plane coinciding with the magnetic dip then its rotation produced no effect upon the galvanometer when inclined to the dip but a few degrees electricity began to appear upon rotation thus when standing upright in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic meridian and when consequently its own plane was inclined only about 20° to the dip revolution of the plate evolved electricity as the inclination was increased the electricity became more powerful until the angle formed by the plane of the plate with the dip was 90° when the electricity for a given velocity of the plate was a maximum  154 it is a striking thing to observe the revolving copper plate become thus a new electrical machine and curious results arise on comparing it with the common machine in the one the plate is of the best nonconducting substance that can be applied in the other it is the most perfect conductor in the one insulation is essential in the other it is fatal in comparison of the quantities of electricity produced the metal machine does not at all fall below the glass one for it can produce a constant current capable of deflecting the galvanometer needle whereas the latter cannot it is quite true that the force of the current thus evolved has not as yet been increased so as to render it available in any of our ordinary applications of this power but there appears every reasonable expectation that this may hereafter be effected and probably by several arrangements weak as the current may seem to be it is as strong as if not stronger than any thermoelectric current for it can pass fluids 23 agitate the animal system and in the case of an electromagnet has produced sparks 32  155 a disc of copper one fifth of an inch thick and only one inch and a half in diameter was amalgamated at the edge a square piece of sheet lead copper would have been better of equal thickness had a circular hole cut in it into which the disc loosely fitted a little mercury completed the metallic communication of the disc and its surrounding ring the latter was attached to one of the galvanometer wires and the other wire dipped into a little metallic cup containing mercury fixed upon the top of the copper axis of the small disc upon rotating the disc in a horizontal plane the galvanometer needle could be affected although the earth was the only magnet employed and the radius of the disc but three quarters of an inch in which space only the current was excited  156 on putting the pole of a magnet under the revolving disc the galvanometer needle could be permanently deflected  157 on using copper wires one sixth of an inch in thickness instead of the smaller wires 86 hitherto constantly employed far more powerful effects were obtained perhaps if the galvanometer had consisted of fewer turns of thick wire instead of many convolutions of thinner more striking effects would have been produced  158 one form of apparatus which i purpose having arranged is to have several discs superposed the discs are to be metallically connected alternately at the edges and at the centres by means of mercury and are then to be revolved alternately in opposite directions ie the first third fifth c to the right hand and the second fourth sixth c to the left hand the whole being placed so that the discs are perpendicular to the dip or intersect most directly the magnetic curves of powerful magnets the electricity will be from the centre to the circumference in one set of discs and from the circumference to the centre in those on each side of them thus the action of the whole will conjoin to produce one combined and more powerful current  159 i have rather however been desirous of discovering new facts and new relations dependent on magnetoelectric induction than of exalting the force of those already obtained being assured that the latter would find their full development hereafter                                       160 i referred in my former paper to the probable influence of terrestrial magnetoelectric induction 137 in producing either altogether or in part the phenomena observed by messrs christie and barlowa whilst revolving ferruginous bodies and especially those observed by the latter when rapidly rotating an iron shell which were by that philosopher referred to a change in the ordinary disposition of the magnetism of the ball i suggested also that the rotation of a copper globe would probably insulate the effects due to electric currents from those due to mere derangement of magnetism and throw light upon the true nature of the phenomena    a christie phil trans 1825 pp 58 347 c barlow phil trans   1825 p 317  161 upon considering the law already referred to 114 it appeared impossible that a metallic globe could revolve under natural circumstances without having electric currents produced within it circulating round the revolving globe in a plane at right angles to the plane of revolution provided its axis of rotation did not coincide with the dip and it appeared that the current would be most powerful when the axis of revolution was perpendicular to the dip of the needle for then all those parts of the ball below a plane passing through its centre and perpendicular to the dip would in moving cut the magnetic curves in one direction whilst all those parts above that plane would intersect them in the other direction currents therefore would exist in these moving parts proceeding from one pole of rotation to the other but the currents above would be in the reverse direction to those below and in conjunction with them would produce a continued circulation of electricity  162 as the electric currents are nowhere interrupted in the ball powerful effects were expected and i endeavoured to obtain them with simple apparatus the ball i used was of brass it had belonged to an old electrical machine was hollow thin too thin and four inches in diameter a brass wire was screwed into it and the ball either turned in the hand by the wire or sometimes to render it more steady supported by its wire in a notched piece of wood and motion again given by the hand the ball gave no signs of magnetism when at rest  163 a compound magnetic needle was used to detect the currents it was arranged thus a sewingneedle had the head and point broken off and was then magnetised being broken in halves the two magnets thus produced were fixed on a stem of dried grass so as to be perpendicular to it and about four inches asunder they were both in one plane but their similar poles in contrary directions the grass was attached to a piece of unspun silk about six inches long the latter to a stick passing through a cork in the mouth of a cylindrical jar and thus a compound arrangement was obtained perfectly sheltered from the motion of the air but little influenced by the magnetism of the earth and yet highly sensible to magnetic and electric forces when the latter were brought into the vicinity of the one or the other needle  164 upon adjusting the needles to the plane of the magnetic meridian arranging the ball on the outside of the glass jar to the west of the needles and at such a height that its centre should correspond horizontally with the upper needle whilst its axis was in the plane of the magnetic meridian but perpendicular to the dip and then rotating the ball the needle was immediately affected upon inverting the direction of rotation the needle was again affected but in the opposite direction when the ball revolved from east over to west the marked pole went eastward when the ball revolved in the opposite direction the marked pole went westward or towards the ball upon placing the ball to the east of the needles still the needle was deflected in the same way ie when the ball revolved from east over to west the marked pole wont eastward or towards the ball when the rotation was in the opposite direction the marked pole went westward  165 by twisting the silk of the needles the latter were brought into a position perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic meridian the ball was again revolved with its axis parallel to the needles the upper was affected as before and the deflection was such as to show that both here and in the former case the needle was influenced solely by currents of electricity existing in the brass globe  166 if the upper part of the revolving ball be considered as a wire moving from east to west over the unmarked pole of the earth the current of electricity in it should be from north to south 99 114 150 if the under part be considered as a similar wire moving from west to east over the same pole the electric current should be from south to north and the circulation of electricity should therefore be from north above to south and below back to north in a metal ball revolving from east above to west in these latitudes now these currents are exactly those required to give the directions of the needle in the experiments just described so that the coincidence of the theory from which the experiments were deduced with the experiments themselves is perfect  167 upon inclining the axis of rotation considerably the revolving ball was still found to affect the magnetic needle and it was not until the angle which it formed with the magnetic dip was rendered small that its effects even upon this apparatus were lost 153 when revolving with its axis parallel to the dip it is evident that the globe becomes analogous to the copper plate electricity of one kind might be collected at its equator and of the other kind at its poles  168 a current in the ball such as that described above 161 although it ought to deflect a needle the same way whether it be to the right or the left of the ball and of the axis of rotation ought to deflect it the contrary way when above or below the ball for then the needle is or ought to be acted upon in a contrary direction by the current this expectation was fulfilled by revolving the ball beneath the magnetic needle the latter being still inclosed in its jar when the ball was revolved from east over to west the marked pole of the needle instead of passing eastward went westward and when revolved from west over to east the marked pole went eastward  169 the deflections of the magnetic needle thus obtained with a brass ball are exactly in the same direction as those observed by mr barlow in the revolution of the iron shell and from the manner in which iron exhibits the phenomena of magnetoelectric induction like any other metal and distinct from its peculiar magnetic phenomena 132 it is impossible but that electric currents must have been excited and become active in those experiments what proportion of the whole effect obtained is due to this cause must be decided by a more elaborate investigation of all the phenomena  170 these results in conjunction with the general law before stated 114 suggested an experiment of extreme simplicity which yet on trial was found to answer perfectly the exclusion of all extraneous circumstances and complexity of arrangement and the distinct character of the indications afforded render this single experiment an epitome of nearly all the facts of magnetoelectric induction  171 a piece of common copper wire about eight feet long and one twentieth of an inch in thickness had one of its ends fastened to one of the terminations of the galvanometer wire and the other end to the other termination thus it formed an endless continuation of the galvanometer wire it was then roughly adjusted into the shape of a rectangle or rather of a loop the upper part of which could be carried to and fro over the galvanometer whilst the lower part and the galvanometer attached to it remained steady plate ii fig 30 upon moving this loop over the galvanometer from right to left the magnetic needle was immediately deflected upon passing the loop back again the needle passed in the contrary direction to what it did before upon repeating these motions of the loop in accordance with the vibrations of the needle 39 the latter soon swung through 90° or more  172 the relation of the current of electricity produced in the wire to its motion may be understood by supposing the convolutions at the galvanometer away and the wire arranged as a rectangle with its lower edge horizontal and in the plane of the magnetic meridian and a magnetic needle suspended above and over the middle part of this edge and directed by the earth fig 30 on passing the upper part of the rectangle from west to east into the position represented by the dotted line the marked pole of the magnetic needle went west the electric current was therefore from north to south in the part of the wire passing under the needle and from south to north in the moving or upper part of the parallelogram on passing the upper part of the rectangle from east to west over the galvanometer the marked pole of the needle went east and the current of electricity was therefore the reverse of the former  173 when the rectangle was arranged in a plane east and west and the magnetic needle made parallel to it either by the torsion of its suspension thread or the action of a magnet still the general effects were the same on moving the upper part of the rectangle from north to south the marked pole of the needle went north when the wire was moved in the opposite direction the marked pole went south the same effect took place when the motion of the wire was in any other azimuth of the line of dip the direction of the current always being conformable to the law formerly expressed 114 and also to the directions obtained with the rotating ball 101  174 in these experiments it is not necessary to move the galvanometer or needle from its first position it is quite sufficient if the wire of the rectangle is distorted where it leaves the instrument and bent so as to allow the moving upper part to travel in the desired direction  175 the moveable part of the wire was then arranged below the galvanometer but so as to be carried across the dip it affected the instrument as before and in the same direction ie when carried from west to east under the instrument the marked end of the needle went west as before this should of course be the case for when the wire is cutting the magnetic dip in a certain direction an electric current also in a certain direction should be induced in it  176 if in fig 31 dp be parallel to the dip and ba be considered as the upper part of the rectangle 171 with an arrow c attached to it both these being retained in a plane perpendicular to the dipthen however ba with its attached arrow is moved upon dp as an axis if it afterwards proceed in the direction of the arrow a current of electricity will move along it from b towards a  177 when the moving part of the wire was carried up or down parallel to the dip no effect was produced on the galvanometer when the direction of motion was a little inclined to the dip electricity manifested itself and was at a maximum when the motion was perpendicular to the magnetic direction  178 when the wire was bent into other forms and moved equally strong effects were obtained especially when instead of a rectangle a double catenarian curve was formed of it on one side of the galvanometer and the two single curves or halves were swung in opposite directions at the same time their action then combined to affect the galvanometer but all the results were reducible to those above described  179 the longer the extent of the moving wire and the greater the space through which it moves the greater is the effect upon the galvanometer  180 the facility with which electric currents are produced in metals when moving under the influence of magnets suggests that henceforth precautions should always be taken in experiments upon metals and magnets to guard against such effects considering the universality of the magnetic influence of the earth it is a consequence which appears very extraordinary to the mind that scarcely any piece of metal can be moved in contact with others either at rest or in motion with different velocities or in varying directions without an electric current existing within them it is probable that amongst arrangements of steamengines and metal machinery some curious accidental magnetoelectric combinations may be found producing effects which have never been observed or if noticed have never as yet been understood                                       181 upon considering the effects of terrestrial magnetoelectric induction which have now been described it is almost impossible to resist the impression that similar effects but infinitely greater in force may be produced by the action of the globe as a magnet upon its own mass in consequence of its diurnal rotation it would seem that if a bar of metal be laid in these latitudes on the surface of the earth parallel to the magnetic meridian a current of electricity tends to pass through it from south to north in consequence of the travelling of the bar from west to east 172 by the rotation of the earth that if another bar in the same direction be connected with the first by wires it cannot discharge the current of the first because it has an equal tendency to have a current in the same direction induced within itself but that if the latter be carried from east to west which is equivalent to a diminution of the motion communicated to it from the earth 172 then the electric current from south to north is rendered evident in the first bar in consequence of its discharge at the same time by means of the second  182 upon the supposition that the rotation of the earth tended by magnetoelectric induction to cause currents in its own mass these would according to the law 114 and the experiments be upon the surface at least from the parts in the neighbourhood of or towards the plane of the equator in opposite directions to the poles and if collectors could be applied at the equator and at the poles of the globe as has been done with the revolving copper plate 150 and also with magnets 220 then negative electricity would be collected at the equator and positive electricity at both poles 222 but without the conductors or something equivalent to them it is evident these currents could not exist as they could not be discharged  183 i did not think it impossible that some natural difference might occur between bodies relative to the intensity of the current produced or tending to be produced in them by magnetoelectric induction which might be shown by opposing them to each other especially as messrs arago babbage herschel and harris have all found great differences not only between the metals and other substances but between the metals themselves in their power of receiving motion from or giving it to a magnet in trials by revolution 130 i therefore took two wires each one hundred and twenty feet long one of iron and the other of copper these were connected with each other at their ends and then extended in the direction of the magnetic meridian so as to form two nearly parallel lines nowhere in contact except at the extremities the copper wire was then divided in the middle and examined by a delicate galvanometer but no evidence of an electrical current was obtained  184 by favour of his royal highness the president of the society i obtained the permission of his majesty to make experiments at the lake in the gardens of kensingtonpalace for the purpose of comparing in a similar manner water and metal the basin of this lake is artificial the water is supplied by the chelsea company no springs run into it and it presented what i required namely a uniform mass of still pure water with banks ranging nearly from east to west and from north to south  185 two perfectly clean bright copper plates each exposing four square feet of surface were soldered to the extremities of a copper wire the plates were immersed in the water north and south of each other the wire which connected them being arranged upon the grass of the bank the plates were about four hundred and eighty feet from each other in a right line the wire was probably six hundred feet long this wire was then divided in the middle and connected by two cups of mercury with a delicate galvanometer  186 at first indications of electric currents were obtained but when these were tested by inverting the direction of contact and in other ways they were found to be due to other causes than the one sought for a little difference in temperature a minute portion of the nitrate of mercury used to amalgamate the wires entering into the water employed to reduce the two cups of mercury to the same temperature was sufficient to produce currents of electricity which affected the galvanometer notwithstanding they had to pass through nearly five hundred feet of water when these and other interfering causes were guarded against no effect was obtained and it appeared that even such dissimilar substances as water and copper when cutting the magnetic curves of the earth with equal velocity perfectly neutralized each others action  187 mr fox of falmouth has obtained some highly important results respecting the electricity of metalliferous veins in the mines of cornwall which have been published in the philosophical transactionsa i have examined the paper with a view to ascertain whether any of the effects were probably referable to magnetoelectric induction but though unable to form a very strong opinion believe they are not when parallel veins running east and west were compared the general tendency of the electricity in the wires was from north to south when the comparison was made between parts towards the surface and at some depth the current of electricity in the wires was from above downwards if there should be any natural difference in the force of the electric currents produced by magnetoelectric induction in different substances or substances in different positions moving with the earth and which might be rendered evident by increasing the masses acted upon then the wires and veins experimented with by mr fox might perhaps have acted as dischargers to the electricity of the mass of strata included between them and the directions of the currents would agree with those observed as above    a 1830 p 399  188 although the electricity obtained by magnetoelectric induction in a few feet of wire is of but small intensity and has not yet been observed except in metals and carbon in a particular state still it has power to pass through brine 23 and as increased length in the substance acted upon produces increase of intensity i hoped to obtain effects from extensive moving masses of water though quiescent water gave none i made experiments therefore by favour at waterloo bridge extending a copper wire nine hundred and sixty feet in length upon the parapet of the bridge and dropping from its extremities other wires with extensive plates of metal attached to them to complete contact with the water thus the wire and the water made one conducting circuit and as the water ebbed or flowed with the tide i hoped to obtain currents analogous to those of the brass ball 161  189 i constantly obtained deflections at the galvanometer but they were very irregular and were in succession referred to other causes than that sought for the different condition of the water as to purity on the two sides of the river the difference in temperature slight differences in the plates in the solder used in the more or less perfect contact made by twisting or otherwise all produced effects in turn and though i experimented on the water passing through the middle arches only used platina plates instead of copper and took every other precaution i could not after three days obtain any satisfactory results  190 theoretically it seems a necessary consequence that where water is flowing there electric currents should be formed thus if a line be imagined passing from dover to calais through the sea and returning through the land beneath the water to dover it traces out a circuit of conducting matter one part of which when the water moves up or down the channel is cutting the magnetic curves of the earth whilst the other is relatively at rest this is a repetition of the wire experiment 171 but with worse conductors still there is every reason to believe that electric currents do run in the general direction of the circuit described either one way or the other according as the passage of the waters is up or down the channel where the lateral extent of the moving water is enormously increased it does not seem improbable that the effect should become sensible and the gulf stream may thus perhaps from electric currents moving across it by magnetoelectric induction from the earth exert a sensible influence upon the forms of the lines of magnetic variationa    a theoretically even a ship or a boat when passing on the surface   of the water in northern or southern latitudes should have currents   of electricity running through it directly across the line of her   motion or if the water is flowing past the ship at anchor similar   currents should occur  191 though positive results have not yet been obtained by the action of the earth upon water and aqueous fluids yet as the experiments are very limited in their extent and as such fluids do yield the current by artificial magnets 23 for transference of the current is proof that it may be produced 213 the supposition made that the earth produces these induced currents within itself 181 in consequence of its diurnal rotation is still highly probable 222 223 and when it is considered that the moving masses extend for thousands of miles across the magnetic curves cutting them in various directions within its mass as well as at the surface it is possible the electricity may rise to considerable intensity  192 i hardly dare venture even in the most hypothetical form to ask whether the aurora borealis and australia may not be the discharge of electricity thus urged towards the poles of the earth from whence it is endeavouring to return by natural and appointed means above the earth to the equatorial regions the nonoccurrence of it in very high latitudes is not at all against the supposition and it is remarkable that mr fox who observed the deflections of the magnetic needle at falmouth by the aurora borealis gives that direction of it which perfectly agrees with the present view he states that all the variations at night were towards the easta and this is what would happen if electric currents were setting from south to north in the earth under the needle or from north to south in space above it    a philosophical transactions 1831 p 202   § 6 general remarks and illustrations of the force and direction of magnetoelectric induction   193 in the repetition and variation of aragos experiment by messrs babbage herschel and harris these philosophers directed their attention to the differences of force observed amongst the metals and other substances in their action on the magnet these differences were very greata and led me to hope that by mechanical combinations of various metals important results might be obtained 183 the following experiments were therefore made with a view to obtain if possible any such difference of the action of two metals    b philosophical transactions 1825 p 472 1831 p78  194 a piece of soft iron bonnetwire covered with cotton was laid bare and cleaned at one extremity and there fastened by metallic contact with the clean end of a copper wire both wires were then twisted together like the strands of a rope for eighteen or twenty inches and the remaining parts being made to diverge their extremities were connected with the wires of the galvanometer the iron wire was about two feet long the continuation to the galvanometer being copper  195 the twisted copper and iron touching each other nowhere but at the extremity were then passed between the poles of a powerful magnet arranged horseshoe fashion fig 32 but not the slightest effect was observed at the galvanometer although the arrangement seemed fitted to show any electrical difference between the two metals relative to the action of the magnet  196 a soft iron cylinder was then covered with paper at the middle part and the twisted portion of the above compound wire coiled as a spiral around it the connexion with the galvanometer still being made at the ends a and b the iron cylinder was then brought in contact with the poles of a powerful magnet capable of raising thirty pounds yet no signs of electricity appeared at the galvanometer every precaution was applied in making and breaking contact to accumulate effect but no indications of a current could be obtained  197 copper and tin copper and zinc tin and zinc tin and iron and zinc and iron were tried against each other in a similar manner 194 but not the slightest sign of electric currents could be procured  198 two flat spirals one of copper and the other of iron containing each eighteen inches of wire were connected with each other and with the galvanometer and then put face to face so as to be in contrary directions when brought up to the magnetic pole 53 no electrical indications at the galvanometer were observed when one was turned round so that both were in the same direction the effect at the galvanometer was very powerful  199 the compound helix of copper and iron wire formerly described 8 was arranged as a double helix one of the helices being all iron and containing two hundred and fourteen feet the other all copper and continuing two hundred and eight feet the two similar ends aa of the copper and iron helix were connected together and the other ends bb of each helix connected with the galvanometer so that when a magnet was introduced into the centre of the arrangement the induced currents in the iron and copper would tend to proceed in contrary directions yet when a magnet was inserted or a soft iron bar within made a magnet by contact with poles no effect at the needle was produced  200 a glass tube about fourteen inches long was filled with strong sulphuric acid twelve inches of the end of a clean copper wire were bent up into a bundle and inserted into the tube so as to make good superficial contact with the acid and the rest of the wire passed along the outside of the tube and away to the galvanometer a wire similarly bent up at the extremity was immersed in the other end of the sulphuric acid and also connected with the galvanometer so that the acid and copper wire were in the same parallel relation to each other in this experiment as iron and copper were in the first 194 when this arrangement was passed in a similar manner between the poles of the magnet not the slightest effect at the galvanometer could be perceived  201 from these experiments it would appear that when metals of different kinds connected in one circuit are equally subject in every circumstance to magnetoelectric induction they exhibit exactly equal powers with respect to the currents which either are formed or tend to form in them the same even appears to be the case with regard to fluids and probably all other substances  202 still it seemed impossible that these results could indicate the relative inductive power of the magnet upon the different metals for that the effect should be in some relation to the conducting power seemed a necessary consequence 139 and the influence of rotating plates upon magnets had been found to bear a general relation to the conducting power of the substance used  203 in the experiments of rotation 81 the electric current is excited and discharged in the same substance be it a good or bad conductor but in the experiments just described the current excited in iron could not be transmitted but through the copper and that excited in copper had to pass through iron ie supposing currents of dissimilar strength to be formed in the metals proportionate to their conducting power the stronger current had to pass through the worst conductor and the weaker current through the best  204 experiments were therefore made in which different metals insulated from each other were passed between the poles of the magnet their opposite ends being connected with the same end of the galvanometer wire so that the currents formed and led away to the galvanometer should oppose each other and when considerable lengths of different wires were used feeble deflections were obtained  205 to obtain perfectly satisfactory results a new galvanometer was constructed consisting of two independent coils each containing eighteen feet of silked copper wire these coils were exactly alike in shape and number of turns and were fixed side by side with a small interval between them in which a double needle could be hung by a fibre of silk exactly as in the former instrument 87 the coils may be distinguished by the letters kl and when electrical currents were sent through them in the same direction acted upon the needle with the sum of their powers when in opposite directions with the difference of their powers  206 the compound helix 199 8 was now connected the ends a and b of the iron with a and b ends of galvanometer coil k and the ends a and b of the copper with b and a ends of galvanometer coil l so that the currents excited in the two helices should pass in opposite directions through the coils k and l on introducing a small cylinder magnet within the helices the galvanometer needle was powerfully deflected on disuniting the iron helix the magnet caused with the copper helix alone still stronger deflection in the same direction on reuniting the iron helix and unconnecting the copper helix the magnet caused a moderate deflection in the contrary direction thus it was evident that the electric current induced by a magnet in a copper wire was far more powerful than the current induced by the same magnet in an equal iron wire  207 to prevent any error that might arise from the greater influence from vicinity or other circumstances of one coil on the needle beyond that of the other the iron and copper terminations were changed relative to the galvanometer coils kl so that the one which before carried the current from the copper now conveyed that from the iron and vice versa but the same striking superiority of the copper was manifested as before this precaution was taken in the rest of the experiments with other metals to be described  208 i then had wires of iron zinc copper tin and lead drawn to the same diameter very nearly one twentieth of an inch and i compared exactly equal lengths namely sixteen feet of each in pairs in the following manner the ends of the copper wire were connected with the ends a and b of galvanometer coil k and the ends of the zinc wire with the terminations a and b of the galvanometer coil l the middle part of each wire was then coiled six times round a cylinder of soft iron covered with paper long enough to connect the poles of daniells horseshoe magnet 56 fig 33 so that similar helices of copper and zinc each of six turns surrounded the bar at two places equidistant from each other and from the poles of the magnet but these helices were purposely arranged so as to be in contrary directions and therefore send contrary currents through the galvanometer coils k and l  209 on making and breaking contact between the soft iron bar and the poles of the magnet the galvanometer was strongly affected on detaching the zinc it was still more strongly affected in the same direction on taking all the precautions before alluded to 207 with others it was abundantly proved that the current induced by the magnet in copper was far more powerful than in zinc  210 the copper was then compared in a similar manner with tin lead and iron and surpassed them all even more than it did zinc the zinc was then compared experimentally with the tin lead and iron and found to produce a more powerful current than any of them iron in the same manner proved superior to tin and lead tin came next and lead the last  211 thus the order of these metals is copper zinc iron tin and lead it is exactly their order with respect to conducting power for electricity and with the exception of iron is the order presented by the magnetorotation experiments of messrs babbage herschel harris c the iron has additional power in the latter kind of experiments because of its ordinary magnetic relations and its place relative to magnetoelectric action of the kind now under investigation cannot be ascertained by such trials in the manner above described it may be correctly ascertaineda    a mr christie who being appointed reporter upon this paper had it   in his hands before it was complete felt the difficulty 202 and   to satisfy his mind made experiments upon iron and copper with the   large magnet44 and came to the same conclusions as i have arrived   at the two sets of experiments were perfectly independent of each   other neither of us being aware of the others proceedings  212 it must still be observed that in these experiments the whole effect between different metals is not obtained for of the thirtyfour feet of wire included in each circuit eighteen feet are copper in both being the wire of the galvanometer coils and as the whole circuit is concerned in the resulting force of the current tins circumstance must tend to diminish the difference which would appear between the metals if the circuits were of the same substances throughout in the present case the difference obtained is probably not more than a half of that which would be given if the whole of each circuit were of one metal  213 these results tend to prove that the currents produced by magnetoelectric induction in bodies is proportional to their conducting power that they are exactly proportional to and altogether dependent upon the conducting power is i think proved by the perfect neutrality displayed when two metals or other substances as acid water c c 201 186 are opposed to each other in their action the feeble current which tends to be produced in the worse conductor has its transmission favoured in the better conductor and the stronger current which tends to form in the latter has its intensity diminished by the obstruction of the former and the forces of generation and obstruction are so perfectly neutralize each other exactly now as the obstruction is inversely as the balanced as to conducting power the tendency to generate a current must be directly as that power to produce this perfect equilibrium  214 the cause of the equality of action under the various circumstances described where great extent of wire 183 or wire and water 181 were connected together which yet produced such different effects upon the magnet is now evident and simple  215 the effects of a rotating substance upon a needle or magnet ought where ordinary magnetism has no influence to be directly as the conducting power of the substance and i venture now to predict that such will be found to be the case and that in all those instances where nonconductors have been supposed to exhibit this peculiar influence the motion has been due to some interfering cause of an ordinary kind as mechanical communication of motion through the parts of the apparatus or otherwise as in the case mr harris has pointed outa or else to ordinary magnetic attractions to distinguish the effects of the latter from those of the induced electric currents i have been able to devise a most perfect test which shall be almost immediately described 243    a philosophical transactions 1831 p 68  216 there is every reason to believe that the magnet or magnetic needle will become an excellent measurer of the conducting power of substances rotated near it for i have found by careful experiment that when a constant current of electricity was sent successively through a series of wires of copper platina zinc silver lead and tin drawn to the same diameter the deflection of the needle was exactly equal by them all it must be remembered that when bodies are rotated in a horizontal plane the magnetism of the earth is active upon them as the effect is general to the whole of the plate it may not interfere in these cases but in some experiments and calculations may be of important consequence  217 another point which i endeavoured to ascertain was whether it was essential or not that the moving part of the wire should in cutting the magnetic curves pass into positions of greater or lesser magnetic force or whether always intersecting curves of equal magnetic intensity the mere motion was sufficient for the production of the current that the latter is true has been proved already in several of the experiments on terrestrial magnetoelectric induction thus the electricity evolved from the copper plate 149 the currents produced in the rotating globe 161 c and those passing through the moving wire 171 are all produced under circumstances in which the magnetic force could not but be the same during the whole experiments  218 to prove the point with an ordinary magnet a copper disc was cemented upon the end of a cylinder magnet with paper intervening the magnet and disc were rotated together and collectors attached to the galvanometer brought in contact with the circumference and the central part of the copper plate the galvanometer needle moved as in former cases and the direction of motion was the same as that which would have resulted if the copper only had revolved and the magnet been fixed neither was there any apparent difference in the quantity of deflection hence rotating the magnet causes no difference in the results for a rotatory and a stationary magnet produce the same effect upon the moving copper  219 a copper cylinder closed at one extremity was then put over the magnet one half of which it inclosed like a cap it was firmly fixed and prevented from touching the magnet anywhere by interposed paper the arrangement was then floated in a narrow jar of mercury so that the lower edge of the copper cylinder touched the fluid metal one wire of the galvanometer dipped into this mercury and the other into a little cavity in the centre of the end of the copper cap upon rotating the magnet and its attached cylinder abundance of electricity passed through the galvanometer and in the same direction as if the cylinder had rotated only the magnet being still the results therefore were the same as those with the disc 218  220 that the metal of the magnet itself might be substituted for the moving cylinder disc or wire seemed an inevitable consequence and yet one which would exhibit the effects of magnetoelectric induction in a striking form a cylinder magnet had therefore a little hole made in the centre of each end to receive a drop of mercury and was then floated pole upwards in the same metal contained in a narrow jar one wire from the galvanometer dipped into the mercury of the jar and the other into the drop contained in the hole at the upper extremity of the axis the magnet was then revolved by a piece of string passed round it and the galvanometerneedle immediately indicated a powerful current of electricity on reversing the order of rotation the electrical current was reversed the direction of the electricity was the same as if the copper cylinder 219 or a copper wire had revolved round the fixed magnet in the same direction as that which the magnet itself had followed thus a singular independence of the magnetism and the bar in which it resides is rendered evident  221 in the above experiment the mercury reached about halfway up the magnet but when its quantity was increased until within one eighth of an inch of the top or diminished until equally near the bottom still the same effects and the same direction of electrical current was obtained but in those extreme proportions the effects did not appear so strong as when the surface of the mercury was about the middle or between that and an inch from each end the magnet was eight inches and a half long and three quarters of an inch in diameter  222 upon inversion of the magnet and causing rotation in the same direction ie always screw or always unscrew then a contrary current of electricity was produced but when the motion of the magnet was continued in a direction constant in relation to its own axis then electricity of the same kind was collected at both poles and the opposite electricity at the equator or in its neighbourhood or in the parts corresponding to it if the magnet be held parallel to the axis of the earth with its unmarked pole directed to the pole star and then rotated so that the parts at its southern side pass from west to east in conformity to the motion of the earth then positive electricity may be collected at the extremities of the magnet and negative electricity at or about the middle of its mass  223 when the galvanometer was very sensible the mere spinning of the magnet in the air whilst one of the galvanometer wires touched the extremity and the other the equatorial parts was sufficient to evolve a current of electricity and deflect the needle  224 experiments were then made with a similar magnet for the purpose of ascertaining whether any return of the electric current could occur at the central or axial parts they having the same angular velocity of rotation as the other parts 259 the belief being that it could not  225 a cylinder magnet seven inches in length and three quarters of an inch in diameter had a hole pierced in the direction of its axis from one extremity a quarter of an inch in diameter and three inches deep a copper cylinder surrounded by paper and amalgamated at both extremities was introduced so as to be in metallic contact at the bottom of the hole by a little mercury with the middle of the magnet insulated at the sides by the paper and projecting about a quarter of an inch above the end of the steel a quill was put over the copper rod which reached to the paper and formed a cup to receive mercury for the completion of the circuit a high paper edge was also raised round that end of the magnet and mercury put within it which however had no metallic connexion with that in the quill except through the magnet itself and the copper rod fig 34 the wires a and b from the galvanometer were dipped into these two portions of mercury any current through them could therefore only pass down the magnet towards its equatorial parts and then up the copper rod or vice versa  226 when thus arranged and rotated screw fashion the marked end of the galvanometer needle went west indicating that there was a current through the instrument from a to b and consequently from b through the magnet and copper rod to a fig 34  227 the magnet was then put into a jar of mercury fig 35 as before 219 the wire a left in contact with the copper axis but the wire b dipped in the mercury of the jar and therefore in metallic communication with the equatorial parts of the magnet instead of its polar extremity on revolving the magnet screw fashion the galvanometer needle was deflected in the same direction as before but far more powerfully yet it is evident that the parts of the magnet from the equator to the pole were out of the electric circuit  228 then the wire a was connected with the mercury on the extremity of the magnet the wire b still remaining in contact with that in the jar fig 36 so that the copper axis was altogether out of the circuit the magnet was again revolved screw fashion and again caused the same deflection of the needle the current being as strong as it was in the last trial 227 and much stronger than at first 226  229 hence it is evident that there is no discharge of the current at the centre of the magnet for the current now freely evolved is up through the magnet but in the first experiment 226 it was down in fact at that time it was only the part of the moving metal equal to a little disc extending from the end of the wire b in the mercury to the wire a that was efficient ie moving with a different angular velocity to the rest of the circuit 258 and for that portion the direction of the current is consistent with the other results  230 in the two after experiments the lateral parts of the magnet or of the copper rod are those which move relative to the other parts of the circuit ie the galvanometer wires and being more extensive intersecting more curves or moving with more velocity produce the greater effect for the discal part the direction of the induced electric current is the same in all namely from the circumference towards the centre                                       231 the law under which the induced electric current excited in bodies moving relatively to magnets is made dependent on the intersection of the magnetic curves by the metal 114 being thus rendered more precise and definite 217 220 224 seem now even to apply to the cause in the first section of the former paper 26 and by rendering a perfect reason for the effects produced take away any for supposing that peculiar condition which i ventured to call the electrotonic state 60  232 when an electrical current is passed through a wire that wire is surrounded at every part by magnetic curves diminishing in intensity according to their distance from the wire and which in idea may be likened to rings situated in planes perpendicular to the wire or rather to the electric current within it these curves although different in form are perfectly analogous to those existing between two contrary magnetic poles opposed to each other and when a second wire parallel to that which carries the current is made to approach the latter 18 it passes through magnetic curves exactly of the same kind as those it would intersect when carried between opposite magnetic poles 109 in one direction and as it recedes from the inducing wire it cuts the curves around it in the same manner that it would do those between the same poles if moved in the other direction  233 if the wire np fig 40 have an electric current passed through it in the direction from p to n then the dotted ring may represent a magnetic curve round it and it is in such a direction that if small magnetic needles lie placed as tangents to it they will become arranged as in the figure n and s indicating north and south ends 14 note  234 but if the current of electricity were made to cease for a while and magnetic poles were used instead to give direction to the needles and make them take the same position as when under the influence of the current then they must be arranged as at fig 41 the marked and unmarked poles ab above the wire being in opposite directions to those ab below in such a position therefore the magnetic curves between the poles ab and ab have the same general direction with the corresponding parts of the ring magnetic curve surrounding the wire np carrying an electric current  235 if the second wire pn fig 40 be now brought towards the principal wire carrying a current it will cut an infinity of magnetic curves similar in direction to that figured and consequently similar in direction to those between the poles ab of the magnets fig 41 and it will intersect these current curves in the same manner as it would the magnet curves if it passed from above between the poles downwards now such an intersection would with the magnets induce an electric current in the wire from p to n 114 and therefore as the curves are alike in arrangement the same effect ought to result from the intersection of the magnetic curves dependent on the current in the wire np and such is the case for on approximation the induced current is in the opposite direction to the principal current 19  236 if the wire pn be carried up from below it will pass in the opposite direction between the magnetic poles but then also the magnetic poles themselves are reversed fig 41 and the induced current is therefore 114 still in the same direction as before it is also for equally sufficient and evident reasons in the same direction if produced by the influence of the curves dependent upon the wire  237 when the second wire is retained at rest in the vicinity the principal wire no current is induced through it for it is intersecting no magnetic curves when it is removed from the principal wire it intersects the curves in the opposite direction to what it did before 235 and a current in the opposite direction is induced which therefore corresponds with the direction of the principal current 19 the same effect would take place if by inverting the direction of motion of the wire in passing between either set of poles fig 41 it were made to intersect the curves there existing in the opposite direction to what it did before  238 in the first experiments 10 13 the inducing wire and that under induction were arranged at a fixed distance from each other and then an electric current sent through the former in such cases the magnetic curves themselves must be considered as moving if i may use the expression across the wire under induction from the moment at which they begin to be developed until the magnetic force of the current is at its utmost expanding as it were from the wire outwards and consequently being in the same relation to the fixed wire under induction as if it had moved in the opposite direction across them or towards the wire carrying the current hence the first current induced in such cases was in the contrary direction to the principal current 17 235 on breaking the battery contact the magnetic curves which are mere expressions for arranged magnetic forces may be conceived as contracting upon and returning towards the failing electrical current and therefore move in the opposite direction across the wire and cause an opposite induced current to the first  239 when in experiments with ordinary magnets the latter in place of being moved past the wires were actually made near them 27 36 then a similar progressive development of the magnetic curves may be considered as having taken place producing the effects which would have occurred by motion of the wires in one direction the destruction of the magnetic power corresponds to the motion of the wire in the opposite direction  240 if instead of intersecting the magnetic curves of a straight wire carrying a current by approximating or removing a second wire 235 a revolving plate be used being placed for that purpose near the wire and as it were amongst the magnetic curves then it ought to have continuous electric currents induced within it and if a line joining the wire with the centre of the plate were perpendicular to both then the induced current ought to be according to the law 114 directly across the plate from one side to the other and at right angles to the direction of the inducing current  241 a single metallic wire one twentieth of an inch in diameter had an electric current passed through it and a small copper disc one inch and a half in diameter revolved near to and under but not in actual contact with it fig 39 collectors were then applied at the opposite edges of the disc and wires from them connected with the galvanometer as the disc revolved in one direction the needle was deflected on one side and when the direction of revolution was reversed the needle was inclined on the other side in accordance with the results anticipated  242 thus the reasons which induce me to suppose a particular state in the wire 60 have disappeared and though it still seems to me unlikely that a wire at rest in the neighbourhood of another carrying a powerful electric current is entirely indifferent to it yet i am not aware of any distinct facts which authorize the conclusion that it is in a particular state                                       243 in considering the nature of the cause assigned in these papers to account for the mutual influence of magnets and moving metals 120 and comparing it with that heretofore admitted namely the induction of a feeble magnetism like that produced in iron it occurred to me that a most decisive experimental test of the two views could be applied 215  244 no other known power has like direction with that exerted between an electric current and a magnetic pole it is tangential while all other forces acting at a distance are direct hence if a magnetic pole on one side of a revolving plate follow its course by reason of its obedience to the tangential force exerted upon it by the very current of electricity which it has itself caused a similar pole on the opposite side of the plate should immediately set it free from this force for the currents which tend to be formed by the action of the two poles are in opposite directions or rather no current tends to be formed or no magnetic curves are intersected 114 and therefore the magnet should remain at rest on the contrary if the action of a north magnetic pole were to produce a southness in the nearest part of the copper plate and a diffuse northness elsewhere 82 as is really the case with iron then the use of another north pole on the opposite side of the same part of the plate should double the effect instead of destroying it and double the tendency of the first magnet to move with the plate  245 a thick copper plate 85 was therefore fixed on a vertical axis a bar magnet was suspended by a plaited silk cord so that its marked pole hung over the edge of the plate and a sheet of paper being interposed the plate was revolved immediately the magnetic pole obeyed its motion and passed off in the same direction a second magnet of equal size and strength was then attached to the first so that its marked pole should hang beneath the edge of the copper plate in a corresponding position to that above and at an equal distance fig 37 then a paper sheath or screen being interposed as before and the plate revolved the poles were found entirely indifferent to its motion although either of them alone would have followed the course of rotation  246 on turning one magnet round so that opposite poles were on each side of the plate then the mutual action of the poles and the moving metal was a maximum  247 on suspending one magnet so that its axis was level with the plate and either pole opposite its edge the revolution of the plate caused no motion of the magnet the electrical currents dependent upon induction would now tend to be produced in a vertical direction across the thickness of the plate but could not be so discharged or at least only to so slight a degree as to leave all effects insensible but ordinary magnetic induction or that on an iron plate would be equally if not more powerfully developed in such a position 251  248 then with regard to the production of electricity in these caseswhenever motion was communicated by the plate to the magnets currents existed when it was not communicated they ceased a marked pole of a large bar magnet was put under the edge of the plate collectors 86 applied at the axis and edge of the plate as on former occasions fig 38 and these connected with the galvanometer when the plate was revolved abundance of electricity passed to the instrument the unmarked pole of a similar magnet was then put over the place of the former pole so that contrary poles were above and below on revolving the plate the electricity was more powerful than before the latter magnet was then turned end for end so that marked poles were both above and below the plate and then upon revolving it scarcely any electricity was procured by adjusting the distance of the poles so as to correspond with their relative force they at last were brought so perfectly to neutralize each others inductive action upon the plate that no electricity could be obtained with the most rapid motion  249 i now proceeded to compare the effect of similar and dissimilar poles upon iron and copper adopting for the purpose mr sturgeons very useful form of aragos experiment this consists in a circular plate of metal supported in a vertical plane by a horizontal axis and weighted a little at one edge or rendered excentric so as to vibrate like a pendulum the poles of the magnets are applied near the side and edges of these plates and then the number of vibrations required to reduce the vibrating arc a certain constant quantity noted in the first description of this instrumenta it is said that opposite poles produced the greatest retarding effect and similar poles none and yet within a page of the place the effect is considered as of the same kind with that produced in iron    a edin phil journal 1825 p 124  250 i had two such plates mounted one of copper one of iron the copper plate alone gave sixty vibrations in the average of several experiments before the arc of vibration was reduced from one constant mark to another on placing opposite magnetic poles near to and on each side of the same place the vibrations were reduced to fifteen on putting similar poles on each side of it they rose to fifty and on placing two pieces of wood of equal size with the poles equally near they became fiftytwo so that when similar poles were used the magnetic effect was little or none the obstruction being due to the confinement of the air rather whilst with opposite poles it was the greatest possible when a pole was presented to the edge of the plate no retardation occurred  251 the iron plate alone made thirtytwo vibrations whilst the arc of vibration diminished a certain quantity on presenting a magnetic pole to the edge of the plate 247 the vibrations were diminished to eleven and when the pole was about half an inch from the edge to five  252 when the marked pole was put at the side of the iron plate at a certain distance the number of vibrations was only five when the marked pole of the second bar was put on the opposite side of the plate at the same distance 250 the vibrations were reduced to two but when the second pole was an unmarked one yet occupying exactly the same position the vibrations rose to twentytwo by removing the stronger of these two opposite poles a little way from the plate the vibrations increased to thirtyone or nearly the original number but on removing it altogether they fell to between five and six  253 nothing can be more clear therefore than that with iron and bodies admitting of ordinary magnetic induction opposite poles on opposite sides of the edge of the plate neutralize each others effect whilst similar poles exalt the action a single pole end on is also sufficient but with copper and substances not sensible to ordinary magnetic impressions similar poles on opposite sides of the plate neutralize each other opposite poles exalt the action and a single pole at the edge or end on does nothing  254 nothing can more completely show the thorough independence of the effects obtained with the metals by arago and those due to ordinary magnetic forces and henceforth therefore the application of two poles to various moving substances will if they appear at all magnetically affected afford a proof of the nature of that affection if opposite poles produce a greater effect than one pole the result will be due to electric currents if similar poles produce more effect than one then the power is not electrical it is not like that active in the metals and carbon when they are moving and in most cases will probably be found to be not even magnetical but the result of irregular causes not anticipated and consequently not guarded against  255 the result of these investigations tends to show that there are really but very few bodies that are magnetic in the manner of iron i have often sought for indications of this power in the common metals and other substances and once in illustration of aragos objection 82 and in hopes of ascertaining the existence of currents in metals by the momentary approach of a magnet suspended a disc of copper by a single fibre of silk in an excellent vacuum and approximated powerful magnets on the outside of the jar making them approach and recede in unison with a pendulum that vibrated as the disc would do but no motion could be obtained not merely no indication of ordinary magnetic powers but none or any electric current occasioned in the metal by the approximation and recession of the magnet i therefore venture to arrange substances in three classes as regards their relation to magnets first those which are affected when at rest like iron nickel c being such as possess ordinary magnetic properties then those which are affected when in motion being conductors of electricity in which are produced electric currents by the inductive force of the magnet and lastly those which are perfectly indifferent to the magnet whether at rest or in motion  256 although it will require further research and probably close investigation both experimental and mathematical before the exact mode of action between a magnet and metal moving relatively to each other is ascertained yet many of the results appear sufficiently clear and simple to allow of expression in a somewhat general mannerif a terminated wire move so as to cut a magnetic curve a power is called into action which tends to urge an electric current through it but this current cannot be brought into existence unless provision be made at the ends of the wire for its discharge and renewal  257 if a second wire move in the same direction as the first the same power is exerted upon it and it is therefore unable to alter the condition of the first for there appear to be no natural differences among substances when connected in a series by which when moving under the same circumstances relative to the magnet one tends to produce a more powerful electric current in the whole circuit than another 201 214  258 but if the second wire move with a different velocity or in some other direction then variations in the force exerted take place and if connected at their extremities an electric current passes through them  259 taking then a mass of metal or an endless wire and referring to the pole of the magnet as a centre of action which though perhaps not strictly correct may be allowed for facility of expression at present if all parts move in the same direction and with the same angular velocity and through magnetic curves of constant intensity then no electric currents are produced this point is easily observed with masses subject to the earths magnetism and may be proved with regard to small magnets by rotating them and leaving the metallic arrangements stationary no current is produced  260 if one part of the wire or metal cut the magnetic curves whilst the other is stationary then currents are produced all the results obtained with the galvanometer are more or less of this nature the galvanometer extremity being the fixed part even those with the wire galvanometer and earth 170 may be considered so without any error in the result  261 if the motion of the metal be in the same direction but the angular velocity of its parts relative to the pole of the magnet different then currents are produced this is the case in aragos experiment and also in the wire subject to the earths induction 172 when it was moved from west to east  262 if the magnet moves not directly to or from the arrangement but laterally then the case is similar to the last  263 if different parts move in opposite directions across the magnetic curves then the effect is a maximum for equal velocities  264 all these in fact are variations of one simple condition namely that all parts of the mass shall not move in the same direction across the curves and with the same angular velocity but they are forms of expression which being retained in the mind i have found useful when comparing the consistency of particular phenomena with general results  royal institution december 21 1831     third series   § 7 identity of electricities derived from different sources § 8 relation by measure of common and voltaic electricity  read january 10th and 17th 1833   § 7 identity of electricities derived from different sources   265 the progress of the electrical researches which i have had the honour to present to the royal society brought me to a point at which it was essential for the further prosecution of my inquiries that no doubt should remain of the identity or distinction of electricities excited by different means it is perfectly true that cavendisha wollastonb colladonc and others have in succession removed some of the greatest objections to the acknowledgement of the identity of common animal and voltaic electricity and i believe that most philosophers consider these electricities as really the same but on the other hand it is also true that the accuracy of wollastons experiments has been deniedd and also that one of them which really is no proper proof of chemical decomposition by common electricity 309 327 has been that selected by several experimenters as the test of chemical action 336 346 it is a fact too that many philosophers are still drawing distinctions between the electricities from different sources or at least doubting whether their identity is proved sir humphry davy for instance in his paper on the torpedoe thought it probable that animal electricity would be found of a peculiar kind and referring to it to common electricity voltaic electricity and magnetism has said distinctions might be established in pursuing the various modifications or properties of electricity in those different forms c indeed i need only refer to the last volume of the philosophical transactions to show that the question is by no means considered as settledf    a phil trans 1779 p 196    b ibid 1801 p 434    c annnles de

those produced by common and   voltaic electricity and says that in its magnetic and chemical power   it does not seem to be essentially peculiarp 274 but he then   says p 275 there are other points of difference and after   referring to them adds how are these differences to be explained   do they admit of explanation similar to that advanced by mr cavendish   in his theory of the torpedo or may we suppose according to the   analogy of the solar ray that the electrical power whether excited   by the common machine or by the voltaic battery or by the torpedo   is not a simple power but a combination of powers which may occur   variously associated and produce all the varieties of electricity   with which we are acquainted  at p 279 of the same volume of transactions is dr ritchies paper from which the following are extracts common electricity is diffused over the surface of the metalvoltaic electricity exists within the metal free electricity is conducted over the surface of the thinnest gold leaf as effectually as over a mass of metal having the same surfacevoltaic electricity requires thickness of metal for its conduction p 280 and again the supposed analogy between common and voltaic electricity which was so eagerly traced after the invention of the pile completely fails in this case which was thought to afford the most striking resemblance p 291  266 notwithstanding therefore the general impression of the identity of electricities it is evident that the proofs have not been sufficiently clear and distinct to obtain the assent of all those who were competent to consider the subject and the question seemed to me very much in the condition of that which sir h davy solved so beautifullynamely whether voltaic electricity in all cases merely eliminated or did not in some actually produce the acid and alkali found after its action upon water the same necessity that urged him to decide the doubtful point which interfered with the extension of his views and destroyed the strictness of his reasoning has obliged me to ascertain the identity or difference of common and voltaic electricity i have satisfied myself that they are identical and i hope the experiments which i have to offer and the proofs flowing from them will be found worthy the attention of the royal society  267 the various phenomena exhibited by electricity may for the purposes of comparison be arranged under two heads namely those connected with electricity of tension and those belonging to electricity in motion this distinction is taken at present not as philosophical but merely as convenient the effect of electricity of tension at rest is either attraction or repulsion at sensible distances the effects of electricity in motion or electrical currents may be considered as 1st evolution of heat 2nd magnetism 3rd chemical decomposition 4th physiological phenomena 5th spark it will be my object to compare electricities from different sources and especially common and voltaic electricities by their power of producing these effects  i voltaic electricity  268 tensionwhen a voltaic battery of 100 pairs of plates has its extremities examined by the ordinary electrometer it is well known that they are found positive and negative the gold leaves at the same extremity repelling each other the gold leaves at different extremities attracting each other even when half an inch or more of air intervenes  269 that ordinary electricity is discharged by points with facility through air that it is readily transmitted through highly rarefied air and also through heated air as for instance a flame is due to its high tension i sought therefore for similar effects in the discharge of voltaic electricity using as a test of the passage of the electricity either the galvanometer or chemical action produced by the arrangement hereafter to be described 312 316  270 the voltaic battery i had at my disposal consisted of 140 pairs of plates four inches square with double coppers it was insulated throughout and diverged a gold leaf electrometer about one third of an inch on endeavouring to discharge this battery by delicate points very nicely arranged and approximated either in the air or in an exhausted receiver i could obtain no indications of a current either by magnetic or chemical action in this however was found no point of discordance between voltaic and common electricity for when a leyden battery 291 was charged so as to deflect the gold leaf electrometer to the same degree the points were found equally unable to discharge it with such effect as to produce either magnetic or chemical action this was not because common electricity could not produce both these effects 307 310 but because when of such low intensity the quantity required to make the effects visible being enormously great 371 375 could not be transmitted in any reasonable time in conjunction with the other proofs of identity hereafter to be given these effects of points also prove identity instead of difference between voltaic and common electricity  271 as heated air discharges common electricity with far greater facility than points i hoped that voltaic electricity might in this way also be discharged an apparatus was therefore constructed plate iii fig 46 in which ab is an insulated glass rod upon which two copper wires c d are fixed firmly to these wires are soldered two pieces of fine platina wire the ends of which are brought very close to each other at e but without touching the copper wire c was connected with the positive pole of a voltaic battery and the wire d with a decomposing apparatus 312 316 from which the communication was completed to the negative pole of the battery in these experiments only two troughs or twenty pairs of plates were used  272 whilst in the state described no decomposition took place at the point a but when the side of a spiritlamp flame was applied to the two platina extremities at e so as to make them bright redhot decomposition occurred iodine soon appeared at the point a and the transference of electricity through the heated air was established on raising the temperature of the points e by a blowpipe the discharge was rendered still more free and decomposition took place instantly on removing the source of heat the current immediately ceased on putting the ends of the wires very close by the side of and parallel to each other but not touching the effects were perhaps more readily obtained than before on using a larger voltaic battery 270 they were also more freely obtained  273 on removing the decomposing apparatus and interposing a galvanometer instead heating the points e as the needle would swing one way and removing the heat during the time of its return 302 feeble deflections were soon obtained thus also proving the current through heated air but the instrument used was not so sensible under the circumstances as chemical action  274 these effects not hitherto known or expected under this form are only cases of the discharge which takes place through air between the charcoal terminations of the poles of a powerful battery when they are gradually separated after contact then the passage is through heated air exactly as with common electricity and sir h davy has recorded that with the original battery of the royal institution this discharge passed through a space of at least four inchesa in the exhausted receiver the electricity would strike through nearly half an inch of space and the combined effects of rarefaction and heat were such upon the inclosed air us to enable it to conduct the electricity through a space of six or seven inches    a elements of chemical philosophy p 153  275 the instantaneous charge of a leyden battery by the poles of a voltaic apparatus is another proof of the tension and also the quantity of electricity evolved by the latter sir h davy saysa when the two conductors from the ends of the combination were connected with a leyden battery one with the internal the other with the external coating the battery instantly became charged and on removing the wires and making the proper connexions either a shock or a spark could be perceived and the least possible time of contact was sufficient to renew the charge to its full intensity    a elements of chemical philosophy p 154  276 in motion i evolution of heatthe evolution of heat in wires and fluids by the voltaic current is matter of general notoriety  277 ii magnetismno fact is better known to philosophers than the power of the voltaic current to deflect the magnetic needle and to make magnets according to certain laws and no effect can be more distinctive of an electrical current  278 iii chemical decompositionthe chemical powers of the voltaic current and their subjection to certain laws are also perfectly well known  279 iv physiological effectsthe power of the voltaic current when strong to shock and convulse the whole animal system and when weak to affect the tongue and the eyes is very characteristic  280 v sparkthe brilliant star of light produced by the discharge of a voltaic battery is known to all as the most beautiful light that man can produce by art                                       281 that these effects may be almost infinitely varied some being exalted whilst others are diminished is universally acknowledged and yet without any doubt of the identity of character of the voltaic currents thus made to differ in their effect the beautiful explication of these variations afforded by cavendishs theory of quantity and intensity requires no support at present as it is not supposed to be doubted  282 in consequence of the comparisons that will hereafter arise between wires carrying voltaic and ordinary electricities and also because of certain views of the condition of a wire or any other conducting substance connecting the poles of a voltaic apparatus it will be necessary to give some definite expression of what is called the voltaic current in contradistinction to any supposed peculiar state of arrangement not progressive which the wire or the electricity within it may be supposed to assume if two voltaic troughs pn pn fig 42 be symmetrically arranged and insulated and the ends np connected by a wire over which a magnetic needle is suspended the wire will exert no effect over the needle but immediately that the ends pn are connected by another wire the needle will be deflected and will remain so as long as the circuit is complete now if the troughs merely act by causing a peculiar arrangement in the wire either of its particles or its electricity that arrangement constituting its electrical and magnetic state then the wire np should be in a similar state of arrangement before p and n were connected to what it is afterwards and should have deflected the needle although less powerfully perhaps to one half the extent which would result when the communication is complete throughout but if the magnetic effects depend upon a current then it is evident why they could not be produced in any degree before the circuit was complete because prior to that no current could exist  283 by current i mean anything progressive whether it be a fluid of electricity or two fluids moving in opposite directions or merely vibrations or speaking still more generally progressive forces by arrangement i understand a local adjustment of particles or fluids or forces not progressive many other reasons might be urged in support of the view of a current rather than an arrangement but i am anxious to avoid stating unnecessarily what will occur to others at the moment  ii ordinary electricity  284 by ordinary electricity i understand that which can be obtained from the common machine or from the atmosphere or by pressure or cleavage of crystals or by a multitude of other operations its distinctive character being that of great intensity and the exertion of attractive and repulsive powers not merely at sensible but at considerable distances  285 tension the attractions and repulsions at sensible distances caused by ordinary electricity are well known to be so powerful in certain cases as to surpass almost infinitely the similar phenomena produced by electricity otherwise excited but still those attractions and repulsions are exactly of the same nature as those already referred to under the head tension voltaic electricity 268 and the difference in degree between them is not greater than often occurs between cases of ordinary electricity only i think it will be unnecessary to enter minutely into the proofs of the identity of this character in the two instances they are abundant are generally admitted as good and lie upon the surface of the subject and whenever in other parts of the comparison i am about to draw a similar case occurs i shall content myself with a mere announcement of the similarity enlarging only upon those parts where the great question of distinction or identity still exists  286 the discharge of common electricity through heated air is a wellknown fact the parallel case of voltaic electricity has already been described 272 c  287 in motion i evolution of heatthe heating power of common electricity when passed through wires or other substances is perfectly well known the accordance between it and voltaic electricity is in this respect complete mr harris has constructed and describeda a very beautiful and sensible instrument on this principle in which the heat produced in a wire by the discharge of a small portion of common electricity is readily shown and to which i shall have occasion to refer for experimental proof in a future part of this paper 344    a philosophical transactions 1827 p 18 edinburgh transactions   1831 harris on a new electrometer c c  288 ii magnetismvoltaic electricity has most extraordinary and exalted magnetic powers if common electricity be identical with it it ought to have the same powers in rendering needles or bars magnetic it is found to agree with voltaic electricity and the direction of the magnetism in both cases is the same but in deflecting the magnetic needle common electricity has been found deficient so that sometimes its power has been denied altogether and at other times distinctions have been hypothetically assumed for the purpose of avoiding the difficultya    a demonferrands manuel delectricité dynamique p 121  289 m colladon of geneva considered that the difference might be due to the use of insufficient quantities of common electricity in all the experiments before made on this head and in a memoir read to the academie des sciences in 1826a describes experiments in which by the use of a battery points and a delicate galvanometer he succeeded in obtaining deflections and thus establishing identity in that respect mm arago ampère and savary are mentioned in the paper as having witnessed a successful repetition of the experiments but as no other one has come forward in confirmation mm arago ampère and savary not having themselves published that i am aware of their admission of the results and as some have not been able to obtain them m colladons conclusions have been occasionally doubted or denied and an important point with me was to establish their accuracy or remove them entirely from the body of received experimental research i am happy to say that my results fully confirm those by m colladon and i should have had no occasion to describe them but that they are essential as proofs of the accuracy of the final and general conclusions i am enabled to draw respecting the magnetic and chemical action of electricity 360 366 367 377 c    a annales de chimie xxxiii p 62  290 the plate electrical machine i have used is fifty inches in diameter it has two sets of rubbers its prime conductor consists of two brass cylinders connected by a third the whole length being twelve feet and the surface in contact with air about 1422 square inches when in good excitation one revolution of the plate will give ten or twelve sparks from the conductors each an inch in length sparks or flashes from ten to fourteen inches in length may easily be drawn from the conductors each turn of the machine when worked moderately occupies about 45ths of a second  291 the electric battery consisted of fifteen equal jars they are coated eight inches upwards from the bottom and are twentythree inches in circumference so that each contains one hundred and eightyfour square inches of glass coated on both sides this is independent of the bottoms which are of thicker glass and contain each about fifty square inches  292 a good discharging train was arranged by connecting metallically a sufficiently thick wire with the metallic gas pipes of the house with the metallic gas pipes belonging to the public gas works of london and also with the metallic water pipes of london it was so effectual in its office as to carry off instantaneously electricity of the feeblest tension even that of a single voltaic trough and was essential to many of the experiments  293 the galvanometer was one or the other of those formerly described 87 205 but the glass jar covering it and supporting the needle was coated inside and outside with tinfoil and the upper part left uncoated that the motions of the needle might be examined was covered with a frame of wirework having numerous sharp points projecting from it when this frame and the two coatings were connected with the discharging train 292 an insulated point or ball connected with the machine when most active might be brought within an inch of any part of the galvanometer yet without affecting the needle within by ordinary electrical attraction or repulsion  294 in connexion with these precautions it may be necessary to state that the needle of the galvanometer is very liable to have its magnetic power deranged diminished or even inverted by the passage of a shock through the instrument if the needle be at all oblique in the wrong direction to the coils of the galvanometer when the shock passes effects of this kind are sure to happen  295 it was to the retarding power of bad conductors with the intention of diminishing its intensity without altering its quantity that i first looked with the hope of being able to make common electricity assume more of the characters and power of voltaic electricity than it is usually supposed to have  296 the coating and armour of the galvanometer were first connected with the discharging train 292 the end b 87 of the galvanometer wire was connected with the outside coating of the battery and then both these with the discharging train the end a of the galvanometer wire was connected with a discharging rod by a wet thread four feet long and finally when the battery 291 had been positively charged by about forty turns of the machine it was discharged by the rod and the thread through the galvanometer the needle immediately moved  297 during the time that the needle completed its vibration in the first direction and returned the machine was worked and the battery recharged and when the needle in vibrating resumed its first direction the discharge was again made through the galvanometer by repeating this action a few times the vibrations soon extended to above 40° on each side of the line of rest  298 this effect could be obtained at pleasure nor was it varied apparently either in direction or degree by using a short thick string or even four short thick strings in place of the long fine thread with a more delicate galvanometer an excellent swing of the needle could be obtained by one discharge of the battery  299 on reversing the galvanometer communications so as to pass the discharge through from b to a the needle was equally well deflected but in the opposite direction  300 the deflections were in the same direction as if a voltaic current had been passed through the galvanometer ie the positively charged surface of the electric battery coincided with the positive end of the voltaic apparatus 268 and the negative surface of the former with the negative end of the latter  301 the battery was then thrown out of use and the communications so arranged that the current could be passed from the prime conductor by the discharging rod held against it through the wet string through the galvanometer coil and into the discharging train 292 by which it was finally dispersed this current could be stopped at any moment by removing the discharging rod and either stopping the machine or connecting the prime conductor by another rod with the discharging train and could be as instantly renewed the needle was so adjusted that whilst vibrating in moderate and small arcs it required time equal to twentyfive beats of a watch to pass in one direction through the arc and of course an equal time to pass in the other direction  302 thus arranged and the needle being stationary the current direct from the machine was sent through the galvanometer for twentyfive beats then interrupted for other twentyfive beats renewed for twentyfive beats more again interrupted for an equal time and so on continually the needle soon began to vibrate visibly and after several alternations of this kind the vibration increased to 40° or more  303 on changing the direction of the current through the galvanometer the direction of the deflection of the needle was also changed in all cases the motion of the needle was in direction the same as that caused either by the use of the electric battery or a voltaic trough 300  304 i now rejected the wet string and substituted a copper wire so that the electricity of the machine passed at once into wires communicating directly with the discharging train the galvanometer coil being one of the wires used for the discharge the effects were exactly those obtained above 302  305 instead of passing the electricity through the system by bringing the discharging rod at the end of it into contact with the conductor four points were fixed on to the rod when the current was to pass they were held about twelve inches from the conductor and when it was not to pass they were turned away then operating as before 302 except with this variation the needle was soon powerfully deflected and in perfect consistency with the former results points afforded the means by which colladon in all cases made his discharges  306 finally i passed the electricity first through an exhausted receiver so as to make it there resemble the aurora borealis and then through the galvanometer to the earth and it was found still effective in deflecting the needle and apparently with the same force as before  307 from all these experiments it appears that a current of common electricity whether transmitted through water or metal or rarefied air or by means of points in common air is still able to deflect the needle the only requisite being apparently to allow time for its action that it is in fact just as magnetic in every respect as a voltaic current and that in this character therefore no distinction exists  308 imperfect conductors as water brine acids c c will be found far more convenient for exhibiting these effects than other modes of discharge as by points or balls for the former convert at once the charge of a powerful battery into a feeble spark discharge or rather continuous current and involve little or no risk of deranging the magnetism of the needles 294  309 iii chemical decompositionthe chemical action of voltaic electricity is characteristic of that agent but not more characteristic than are the laws under which the bodies evolved by decomposition arrange themselves at the poles dr wollaston showeda that common electricity resembled it in these effects and that they are both essentially the same but he mingled with his proofs an experiment having a resemblance and nothing more to a case of voltaic decomposition which however he himself partly distinguished and this has been more frequently referred to by some on the one hand to prove the occurrence of electrochemical decomposition like that of the pile and by others to throw doubt upon the whole paper than the more numerous and decisive experiments which he has detailed    a philosophical transactions 1801 pp 427 434  310 i take the liberty of describing briefly my results and of thus adding my testimony to that of dr wollaston on the identity of voltaic and common electricity as to chemical action not only that i may facilitate the repetition of the experiments but also lead to some new consequences respecting electrochemical decomposition 376 377  311 i first repeated wollastons fourth experimenta in which the ends of coated silver wires are immersed in a drop of sulphate of copper by passing the electricity of the machine through such an arrangement that end in the drop which received the electricity became coated with metallic copper one hundred turns of the machine produced an evident effect two hundred turns a very sensible one the decomposing action was however very feeble very little copper was precipitated and no sensible trace of silver from the other pole appeared in the solution    a philosophical transactions 1801 p 429  312 a much more convenient and effectual arrangement for chemical decompositions by common electricity is the following upon a glass plate fig 43 placed over but raised above a piece of white paper so that shadows may not interfere put two pieces of tinfoil a b connect one of these by an insulated wire c or wire and string 301 with the machine and the other g with the discharging train 292 or the negative conductor provide two pieces of fine platina wire bent as in fig 44 so that the part d f shall be nearly upright whilst the whole is resting on the three bearing points p e f place these as in fig 43 the points p n then become the decomposing poles in this way surfaces of contact as minute as possible can be obtained at pleasure and the connexion can be broken or renewed in a moment and the substances acted upon examined with the utmost facility  313 a coarse line was made on the glass with solution of sulphate of copper and the terminations p and n put into it the foil a was connected with the positive conductor of the machine by wire and wet string so that no sparks passed twenty turns of the machine caused the precipitation of so much copper on the end n that it looked like copper wire no apparent change took place at p  314 a mixture of equal parts of muriatic acid and water was rendered deep blue by sulphate of indigo and a large drop put on the glass fig 43 so that p and n were immersed at opposite sides a single turn of the machine showed bleaching effects round p from evolved chlorine after twenty revolutions no effect of the kind was visible at n but so much chlorine had been set free at p that when the drop was stirred the whole became colourless  315 a drop of solution of iodide of potassium mingled with starch was put into the same position at p and n on turning the machine iodine was evolved at p but not at n  316 a still further improvement in this form of apparatus consists in wetting a piece of filtering paper in the solution to be experimented on and placing that under the points p and n on the glass the paper retains the substance evolved at the point of evolution by its whiteness renders any change of colour visible and allows of the point of contact between it and the decomposing wires being contracted to the utmost degree a piece of paper moistened in the solution of iodide of potassium and starch or of the iodide alone with certain precautions 322 is a most admirable test of electrochemical action and when thus placed and acted upon by the electric current will show iodine evolved at p by only half a turn of the machine with these adjustments and the use of iodide of potassium on paper chemical action is sometimes a more delicate test of electrical currents than the galvanometer 273 such cases occur when the bodies traversed by the current are bad conductors or when the quantity of electricity evolved or transmitted in a given time is very small  317 a piece of litmus paper moistened in solution of common salt or sulphate of soda was quickly reddened at p a similar piece moistened in muriatic acid was very soon bleached at p no effects of a similar kind took place at n  318 a piece of turmeric paper moistened in solution of sulphate of soda was reddened at n by two or three turns of the machine and in twenty or thirty turns plenty of alkali was there evolved on turning the paper round so that the spot came under p and then working the machine the alkali soon disappeared the place became yellow and a brown alkaline spot appeared in the new part under n  319 on combining a piece of litmus with a piece of turmeric paper wetting both with solution of sulphate of soda and putting the paper on the glass so that p was on the litmus and n on the turmeric a very few turns of the machine sufficed to show the evolution of acid at the former and alkali at the latter exactly in the manner effected by a voltaelectric current  320 all these decompositions took place equally well whether the electricity passed from the machine to the foil a through water or through wire only by contact with the conductor or by sparks there provided the sparks were not so large as to cause the electricity to pass in sparks from p to n or towards n and i have seen no reason to believe that in cases of true electrochemical decomposition by the machine the electricity passed in sparks from the conductor or at any part of the current is able to do more because of its tension than that which is made to pass merely as a regular current  321 finally the experiment was extended into the following form supplying in this case the tidiest analogy between common and voltaic electricity three compound pieces of litmus and turmeric paper 319 were moistened in solution of sulphate of soda and arranged on a plate of glass with platina wires as in fig 45 the wire m was connected with the prime conductor of the machine the wire t with the discharging train and the wires r and s entered into the course of the electrical current by means of the pieces of moistened paper they were so bent as to rest each on three points n r p n s p the points r and s being supported by the glass and the others by the papers the three terminations p p p rested on the litmus and the other three n n n on the turmeric paper on working the machine for a short time only acid was evolved at all the poles or terminations p p p by which the electricity entered the solution and alkali at the other poles n n n by which the electricity left the solution  322 in all experiments of electrochemical decomposition by the common machine and moistened papers 316 it is necessary to be aware of and to avoid the following important source of error if a spark passes over moistened litmus and turmeric paper the litmus paper provided it be delicate and not too alkaline is reddened by it and if several sparks are passed it becomes powerfully reddened if the electricity pass a little way from the wire over the surface of the moistened paper before it finds mass and moisture enough to conduct it then the reddening extends as far as the ramifications if similar ramifications occur at the termination n on the turmeric paper they prevent the occurrence of the red spot due to the alkali which would otherwise collect there sparks or ramifications from the points n will also redden litmus paper if paper moistened by a solution of iodide of potassium which is an admirably delicate test of electrochemical action be exposed to the sparks or ramifications or even a feeble stream of electricity through the air from either the point p or n iodine will be immediately evolved  323 these effects must not be confounded with those due to the true electrochemical powers of common electricity and must be carefully avoided when the latter are to be observed no sparks should be passed therefore in any part of the current nor any increase of intensity allowed by which the electricity may be induced to pass between the platina wires and the moistened papers otherwise than by conduction for if it burst through the air the effect referred to above 322 ensues  324 the effect itself is due to the formation of nitric acid by the combination of the oxygen and nitrogen of the air and is in fact only a delicate repetition of cavendishs beautiful experiment the acid so formed though small in quantity is in a high state of concentration as to water and produces the consequent effects of reddening the litmus paper or preventing the exhibition of alkali on the turmeric paper or by acting on the iodide of potassium evolving iodine  325 by moistening a very small slip of litmus paper in solution of caustic potassa and then passing the electric spark over its length in the air i gradually neutralized the alkali and ultimately rendered the paper red on drying it i found that nitrate of potassa had resulted from the operation and that the paper had become touchpaper  326 either litmus paper or white paper moistened in a strong solution of iodide of potassium offers therefore a very simple beautiful and ready means of illustrating cavendishs experiment of the formation of nitric acid from the atmosphere  327 i have already had occasion to refer to an experiment 265 309 made by dr wollaston which is insisted upon too much both by those who oppose and those who agree with the accuracy of his views respecting the identity of voltaic and ordinary electricity by covering fine wires with glass or other insulating substances and then removing only so much matter as to expose the point or a section of the wires and by passing electricity through two such wires the guarded points of which were immersed in water wollaston found that the water could be decomposed even by the current from the machine without sparks and that two streams of gas arose from the points exactly resembling in appearance those produced by voltaic electricity and like the latter giving a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases but dr wollaston himself points out that the effect is different from that of the voltaic pile inasmuch as both oxygen and hydrogen are evolved from each pole he calls it a very close imitation of the galvanic phenomena but adds that in fact the resemblance is not complete and does not trust to it to establish the principles correctly laid down in his paper  328 this experiment is neither more nor less than a repetition in a refined manner of that made by dr pearson in 1797a and previously by mm paets van troostwyk and deiman in 1789 or earlier that the experiment should never be quoted as proving true electrochemical decomposition is sufficiently evident from the circumstance that the law which regulates the transference and final place of the evolved bodies 278 309 has no influence here the water is decomposed at both poles independently of each other and the oxygen and hydrogen evolved at the wires are the elements of the water existing the instant before in those places that the poles or rather points have no mutual decomposing dependence may be shown by substituting a wire or the finger for one of them a change which does not at all interfere with the other though it stops all action at the changed pole this fact may be observed by turning the machine for some time for though bubbles will rise from the point left unaltered in quantity sufficient to cover entirely the wire used for the other communication if they could be applied to it yet not a single bubble will appear on that wire    a nicholsons journal 4to vol i pp 311 299 349  329 when electrochemical decomposition takes place there is great reason to believe that the quantity of matter decomposed is not proportionate to the intensity but to the quantity of electricity passed 320 of this i shall be able to offer some proofs in a future part of this paper 375 377 but in the experiment under consideration this is not the case if with a constant pair of points the electricity be passed from the machine in sparks a certain proportion of gas is evolved but if the sparks be rendered shorter less gas is evolved and if no sparks be passed there is scarcely a sensible portion of gases set free on substituting solution of sulphate of soda for water scarcely a sensible quantity of gas could be procured even with powerful sparks and nearly none with the mere current yet the quantity of electricity in a given time was the same in all these cases  330 i do not intend to deny that with such an apparatus common electricity can decompose water in a manner analogous to that of the voltaic pile i believe at present that it can but when what i consider the true effect only was obtained the quantity of gas given off was so small that i could not ascertain whether it was as it ought to be oxygen at one wire and hydrogen at the other of the two streams one seemed more copious than the other and on turning the apparatus round still the same side in relation to the machine gave the largest stream on substituting solution of sulphate of soda for pure water 329 these minute streams were still observed but the quantities were so small that on working the machine for half an hour i could not obtain at either pole a bubble of gas larger than a small grain of sand if the conclusion which i have drawn 377 relating to the amount of chemical action be correct this ought to be the case  331 i have been the more anxious to assign the true value of this experiment as a test of electrochemical action because i shall have occasion to refer to it in cases of supposed chemical action by magnetoelectric and other electric currents 336 346 and elsewhere but independent of it there cannot be now a doubt that dr wollaston was right in his general conclusion and that voltaic and common electricity have powers of chemical decomposition alike in their nature and governed by the same law of arrangement  332 iv physiological effectsthe power of the common electric current to shock and convulse the animal system and when weak to affect the tongue and the eyes may be considered as the same with the similar power of voltaic electricity account being taken of the intensity of the one electricity and duration of the other when a wet thread was interposed in the course of the current of common electricity from the battery 291 charged by eight or tena revolutions of the machine in good action 290 and the discharge made by platina spatulas through the tongue or the gums the effect upon the tongue and eyes was exactly that of a momentary feeble voltaic circuit    a or even from thirty to forty  333 v sparkthe beautiful flash of light attending the discharge of common electricity is well known it rivals in brilliancy if it does not even very much surpass the light from the discharge of voltaic electricity but it endures for an instant only and is attended by a sharp noise like that of a small explosion still no difficulty can arise in recognising it to be the same spark as that from the voltaic battery especially under certain circumstances the eye cannot distinguish the difference between a voltaic and a common electricity spark if they be taken between amalgamated surfaces of metal at intervals only and through the same distance of air  334 when the leyden battery 291 was discharged through a wet string placed in some part of the circuit away from the place where the spark was to pass the spark was yellowish flamy having a duration sensibly longer than if the water had not been interposed was about threefourths of an inch in length was accompanied by little or no noise and whilst losing part of its usual character had approximated in some degree to the voltaic spark when the electricity retarded by water was discharged between pieces of charcoal it was exceedingly luminous and bright upon both surfaces of the charcoal resembling the brightness of the voltaic discharge on such surfaces when the discharge of the unretarded electricity was taken upon charcoal it was bright upon both the surfaces in that respect resembling the voltaic spark but the noise was loud sharp and ringing  335 i have assumed in accordance i believe with the opinion of every other philosopher that atmospheric electricity is of the same nature with ordinary electricity 284 and i might therefore refer to certain published statements of chemical effects produced by the former as proofs that the latter enjoys the power of decomposition in common with voltaic electricity but the comparison i am drawing is far too rigorous to allow me to use these statements without being fully assured of their accuracy yet i have no right to suppress them because if accurate they establish what i am labouring to put on an undoubted foundation and have priority to my results  336 m bonijol of genevaa is said to have constructed very delicate apparatus for the decomposition of water by common electricity by connecting an insulated lightning rod with his apparatus the decomposition of the water proceeded in a continuous and rapid manner even when the electricity of the atmosphere was not very powerful the apparatus is not described but as the diameter of the wire is mentioned as very small it appears to have been similar in construction to that of wollaston 327 and as that does not furnish a case of true polar electrochemical decomposition 328 this result of m bonijol does not prove the identity in chemical action of common and voltaic electricity    a bibliothèque universelle 1830 tome xlv p 213  337 at the same page of the bibliothèque universelle m bonijol is said to have decomposed potash and also chloride of silver by putting them into very narrow tubes and passing electric sparks from an ordinary machine over them it is evident that these offer no analogy to cases of true voltaic decomposition where the electricity only decomposes when it is conducted by the body acted upon and ceases to decompose according to its ordinary laws when it passes in sparks these effects are probably partly analogous to that which takes place with water in pearsons or wollastons apparatus and may be due to very high temperature acting on minute portions of matter or they may be connected with the results in air 322 as nitrogen can combine directly with oxygen under the influence of the electric spark 324 it is not impossible that it should even take it from the potassium of the potash especially as there would be plenty of potassa in contact with the acting particles to combine with the nitric acid formed however distinct all these actions may be from true polar electrochemical decompositions they are still highly important and wellworthy of investigation  338 the late mr barry communicated a paper to the royal societya last year so distinct in the details that it would seem at once to prove the identity in chemical action of common and voltaic electricity but when examined considerable difficulty arises in reconciling certain of the effects with the remainder he used two tubes each having a wire within it passing through the closed end as is usual for voltaic decompositions the tubes were filled with solution of sulphate of soda coloured with syrup of violets and connected by a portion of the same solution in the ordinary manner the wire in one tube was connected by a gilt thread with the string of an insulated electrical kite and the wire in the other tube by a similar gilt thread with the ground hydrogen soon appeared in the tube connected with the kite and oxygen in the other and in ten minutes the liquid in the first tube was green from the alkali evolved and that in the other red from free acid produced the only indication of the strength or intensity of the atmospheric electricity is in the expression the usual shocks were felt on touching the string    a philosophical transactions 1831 p 165  339 that the electricity in this case does not resemble that from any ordinary source of common electricity is shown by several circumstances wollaston could not effect the decomposition of water by such an arrangement and obtain the gases in separate vessels using common electricity nor have any of the numerous philosophers who have employed such an apparatus obtained any such decomposition either of water or of a neutral salt by the use of the machine i have lately tried the large machine 290 in full action for a quarter of an hour during which time seven hundred revolutions were made without producing any sensible effects although the shocks that it would then give must have been far more powerful and numerous than could have been taken with any chance of safety from an electrical kitestring and by reference to the comparison hereafter to be made 371 it will be seen that for common electricity to have produced the effect the quantity must have been awfully great and apparently far more than could have been conducted to the earth by a gilt thread and at the same time only have produced the usual shocks  340 that the electricity was apparently not analogous to voltaic electricity is evident for the usual shocks only were produced and nothing like the terrible sensation due to a voltaic battery even when it has a tension so feeble as not to strike through the eighth of an inch of air  341 it seems just possible that the air which was passing by the kite and string being in an electrical state sufficient to produce the usual shocks only could still when the electricity was drawn off below renew the charge and so continue the current the string was 1500 feet long and contained two double threads but when the enormous quantity which must have been thus collected is considered 371 376 the explanation seems very doubtful i charged a voltaic battery of twenty pairs of plates four inches square with double coppers very strongly insulated it connected its positive extremity with the discharging train 292 and its negative pole with an apparatus like that of mr barry communicating by a wire inserted three inches into the wet soil of the ground this battery thus arranged produced feeble decomposing effects as nearly as i could judge answering the description mr barry has given its intensity was of course far lower than the electricity of the kitestring but the supply of quantity from the discharging train was unlimited it gave no shocks to compare with the usual shocks of a kitestring  342 mr barrys experiment is a very important one to repeat and verify if confirmed it will be as far as i am aware the first recorded case of true electrochemical decomposition of water by common electricity and it will supply a form of electrical current which both in quantity and intensity is exactly intermediate with those of the common electrical machine and the voltaic pile                                       iii magnetoelectricity  343

heatthe current produced by magnetoelectric induction can heat a wire in the manner of ordinary electricity at the british association of science at oxford in june of the present year i had the pleasure in conjunction with mr harris professor daniell mr duncan and others of making an experiment for which the great magnet in the museum mr harriss new electrometer 287 and the magnetoelectric coil described in my first paper 34 were put in requisition the latter had been modified in the manner i have elsewhere describeda so as to produce an electric spark when its contact with the magnet was made or broken the terminations of the spiral adjusted so as to have their contact with each other broken when the spark was to pass were connected with the wire in the electrometer and it was found that each time the magnetic contact was made and broken expansion of the air within the instrument occurred indicating an increase at the moment of the temperature of the wire    a phil mag and

magnetoelectricity but unavailingly in july last i received an anonymous letter which has since been publisheda describing a magnetoelectric apparatus by which the decomposition of water was effected as the term guarded points is used i suppose the apparatus to have been wollastons 327 c in which case the results did not indicate polar electrochemical decomposition signor botto has recently published certain results which he has obtainedb but they are as at present described inconclusive the apparatus he used was apparently that of dr wollaston which gives only fallacious indications 327 c as magnetoelectricity can produce sparks it would be able to show the effects proper to this apparatus the apparatus of m pixii already referred to 343 has however in the hands of himselfc and m

physiological effectsa frog was convulsed in the earliest experiments on these currents 56 the sensation upon the tongue and the flash before the eyes which i at first obtained only in a feeble degree 56 have been since exalted by more powerful apparatus so as to become even disagreeable  348 v sparkthe feeble spark which i first obtained with these currents 32 has been varied and strengthened by signori nobili and antinori and others so as to leave no doubt as to its identity with the common electric spark                                       iv thermoelectricity  349 with regard to thermoelectricity that beautiful form of electricity discovered by seebeck the very conditions under which it is excited are such as to give no ground for expecting that it can be raised like common electricity to any high degree of tension the effects therefore due to that state are not to be expected the sum of evidence respecting its analogy to the electricities already described is i believe as followstension the attractions and repulsions due to a certain degree of tension have not been observed in currents i evolution of heat i am not aware that its power of raising temperature has been observed ii magnetism it was discovered and is best recognised by its magnetic powers iii chemical decomposition has not been effected by it iv physiological effects nobili has showna that these currents are able to cause contractions in the limbs of a frog v spark the spark has not yet been seen    a bibliothèque universelle xxxvii 15  350 only those effects are weak or deficient which depend upon a certain high degree of intensity and if common electricity be reduced in that quality to a similar degree with the thermoelectricity it can produce no effects beyond the latter                                       v animal electricity  351 after an examination of the experiments of walsha ingenhouszb cavendishc sir h davyd and dr davye no doubt remains on my mind as to the identity of the electricity of the torpedo with common and voltaic electricity and i presume that so little will remain on the minds of others as to justify my refraining from entering at length into the philosophical proofs of that identity the doubts raised by sir h davy have been removed by his brother dr davy the results of the latter being the reverse of those of the former at present the sum of evidence is as follows    a philosophical transactions 1773 p 461    b ibid 1775 p 1    c ibid 1776 p 196    d ibid 1829 p 15    e ibid 1832 p 259  352 tensionno sensible attractions or repulsions due to tension have been observed  353 in motion i evolution of heat not yet observed i have little or no doubt that harriss electrometer would show it 287 359  354 ii magnetismperfectly distinct according to dr davya the current deflected the needle and made magnets under the same law as to direction which governs currents of ordinary and voltaic electricity    a philosophical transactions 1832 p 260  355 iii chemical decompositionalso distinct and though dr davy used an apparatus of similar construction with that of dr wollaston 327 still no error in the present case is involved for the decompositions were polar and in their nature truly electrochemical by the direction of the magnet it was found that the under surface of the fish was negative and the upper positive and in the chemical decompositions silver and lead were precipitated on the wire connected with the under surface and not on the other and when these wires were either steel or silver in solution of common salt gas hydrogen rose from the negative wire but none from the positive  356 another reason for the decomposition being electrochemical is that a wollastons apparatus constructed with wires coated by sealingwax would most probably not have decomposed water even in its own peculiar way unless the electricity had risen high enough in intensity to produce sparks in some part of the circuit whereas the torpedo was not able to produce sensible sparks a third reason is that the purer the water in wollastons apparatus the more abundant is the decomposition and i have found that a machine and wire points which succeeded perfectly well with distilled water failed altogether when the water was rendered a good conductor by sulphate of soda common salt or other saline bodies but in dr davys experiments with the torpedo strong solutions of salt nitrate of silver and superacetate of lead were used successfully and there is no doubt with more success than weaker ones  357 iv physiological effectsthese are so characteristic that by them the peculiar powers of the torpedo and gymnotus are principally recognised  358 v sparkthe electric spark has not yet been obtained or at least i think not but perhaps i had better refer to the evidence on this point humboldt speaking of results obtained by m fahlberg of sweden says this philosopher has seen an electric spark as walsh and ingenhousz had done before him in london by placing the gymnotus in the air and interrupting the conducting chain by two gold leaves pasted upon glass and a line distant from each othera i cannot however find any record of such an observation by either walsh or ingenhousz and do not know where to refer to that by m fahlberg m humboldt could not himself perceive any luminous effect    a edinburgh phil journal ii p 249  again sir john leslie in his dissertation on the progress of mathematical and physical science prefixed to the seventh edition of the encyclopædia britannica edinb 1830 p 622 says from a healthy specimen of the silurus electricus meaning rather the gymnotus exhibited in london vivid sparks were drawn in a darkened room but he does not say he saw them himself nor state who did see them nor can i find any account of such a phenomenon so that the statement is doubtfula    a mr brayley who referred me to those statements and has   extensive knowledge of recorded facts is unacquainted with any   further account relating to them  359 in concluding this summary of the powers of torpedinal electricity i cannot refrain from pointing out the enormous absolute quantity of electricity which the animal must put in circulation at each effort it is doubtful whether any common electrical machine has as yet been able to supply electricity sufficient in a reasonable time to cause true electrochemical decomposition of water 330 339 yet the current from the torpedo has done it the same high proportion is shown by the magnetic effects 296 371 these circumstances indicate that the torpedo has power in the way probably that cavendish describes to continue the evolution for a sensible time so that its successive discharges rather resemble those of a voltaic arrangement intermitting in its action than those of a leyden apparatus charged and discharged many times in succession in reality however there is no philosophical difference between these two cases  360 the general conclusion which must i think be drawn from this collection of facts is that electricity whatever may be its source is identical in its nature the phenomena in the five kinds or species quoted differ not in their character but only in degree and in that respect vary in proportion to the variable circumstances of quantity and intensitya which can at pleasure be made to change in almost any one of the kinds of electricity as much as it does between one kind and another    a the term quantity in electricity is perhaps sufficiently definite as to sense the term intensity is more difficult to define strictly i am using the terms in their ordinary and accepted meaning  table of the experimental effects common to the electricities derived from different sourcesa  table headings  a

believing the point of identity to be satisfactorily established i next endeavoured to obtain a common measure or a known relation as to quantity of the electricity excited by a machine and that from a voltaic pile for the purpose not only of confirming their identity 378 but also of demonstrating certain general principles 366 377 c and creating an extension of the means of investigating and applying the chemical powers of this wonderful and subtile agent  362 the first point to be determined was whether the same absolute quantity of ordinary electricity sent through a galvanometer under different circumstances would cause the same deflection of the needle an arbitrary scale was therefore attached to the galvanometer each division of which was equal to about 4° and the instrument arranged as in former experiments 296 the machine 290 battery 291 and other parts of the apparatus were brought into good order and retained for the time as nearly as possible in the same condition the experiments were alternated so as to indicate any change in the condition of the apparatus and supply the necessary corrections  363 seven of the battery jars were removed and eight retained for present use it was found that about forty turns would fully charge the eight jars they were then charged by thirty turns of the machine and discharged through the galvanometer a thick wet string about ten inches long being included in the circuit the needle was immediately deflected five divisions and a half on the one side of the zero and in vibrating passed as nearly as possible through five divisions and a half on the other side  364 the other seven jars were then added to the eight and the whole fifteen charged by thirty turns of the machine the henleys electrometer stood not quite half as high as before but when the discharge was made through the galvanometer previously at rest the needle immediately vibrated passing exactly to the same division as in the former instance these experiments with eight and with fifteen jars were repeated several times alternately with the same results  365 other experiments were then made in which all the battery was used and its charge being fifty turns of the machine sent through the galvanometer but it was modified by being passed sometimes through a mere wet thread sometimes through thirtyeight inches of thin string wetted by distilled water and sometimes through a string of twelve times the thickness only twelve inches in length and soaked in dilute acid 298 with the thick string the charge passed at once with the thin string it occupied a sensible time and with the thread it required two or three seconds before the electrometer fell entirely down the current therefore must have varied extremely in intensity in these different cases and yet the deflection of the needle was sensibly the same in all of them if any difference occurred it was that the thin string and thread caused greatest deflection and if there is any lateral transmission as m colladon says through the silk in the galvanometer coil it ought to have been so because then the intensity is lower and the lateral transmission less  366 hence it would appear that if the same absolute quantity of electricity pass through the galvanometer whatever may be its intensity the dejecting force upon the magnetic needle is the same  367 the battery of fifteen jars was then charged by sixty revolutions of the machine and discharged as before through the galvanometer the deflection of the needle was now as nearly as possible to the eleventh division but the graduation was not accurate enough for me to assert that the arc was exactly double the former arc to the eye it appeared to be so the probability is that the deflecting force of an electric current is directly proportional to the absolute quantity of electricity passed at whatever intensity that electricity may bea    a the great and general value of the galvanometer as an actual   measure of the electricity passing through it either continuously or   interruptedly must be evident from a consideration of these two   conclusions as constructed by professor ritchie with glass threads   see philosophical transactions 1830 p 218 and quarterly journal   of science new series vol i p29 it apparently seems to leave   nothing unsupplied in its own department  368 dr ritchie has shown that in a case where the intensity of the electricity remained the same the deflection of the magnetic needle was directly as the quantity of electricity passed through the galvanometera mr harris has shown that the heating power of common electricity on metallic wires is the same for the same quantity of electricity whatever its intensity might have previously beenb    a quarterly journal of science new series vol i p 33    b plymouth transactions page 22  369 the next point was to obtain a voltaic arrangement producing an effect equal to that just described 367 a platina and a zinc wire were passed through the same hole of a drawplate being then one eighteenth of an inch in diameter these were fastened to a support so that their lower ends projected were parallel and five sixteenths of an inch apart the upper ends were wellconnected with the galvanometer wires some acid was diluted and after various preliminary experiments that adopted as a standard which consisted of one drop strong sulphuric acid in four ounces distilled water finally the time was noted which the needle required in swinging either from right to left or left to right it was equal to seventeen beats of my watch the latter giving one hundred and fifty in a minute the object of these preparations was to arrange a voltaic apparatus which by immersion in a given acid for a given time much less than that required by the needle to swing in one direction should give equal deflection to the instrument with the discharge of ordinary electricity from the battery 363 364 and a new part of the zinc wire having been brought into position with the platina the comparative experiments were made  370 on plunging the zinc and platina wires five eighths of an inch deep into the acid and retaining them there for eight beats of the watch after which they were quickly withdrawn the needle was deflected and continued to advance in the same direction some time after the voltaic apparatus had been removed from the acid it attained the fiveandahalf division and then returned swinging an equal distance on the other side this experiment was repeated many times and always with the same result  371 hence as an approximation and judging from magnetic force only at present 376 it would appear that two wires one of platina and one of zinc each one eighteenth of an inch in diameter placed five sixteenths of an inch apart and immersed to the depth of five eighths of an inch in acid consisting of one drop oil of vitriol and four ounces distilled water at a temperature about 60° and connected at the other extremities by a copper wire eighteen feet long and one eighteenth of an inch thick being the wire of the galvanometer coils yield as much electricity in eight beats of my watch or in 8150ths of a minute as the electrical battery charged by thirty turns of the large machine in excellent order 363 364 notwithstanding this apparently enormous disproportion the results are perfectly in harmony with those effects which are known to be produced by variations in the intensity and quantity of the electric fluid  372 in order to procure a reference to chemical action the wires were now retained immersed in the acid to the depth of five eighths of an inch and the needle when stationary observed it stood as nearly as the unassisted eye could decide at 513 division hence a permanent deflection to that extent might be considered as indicating a constant voltaic current which in eight beats of my watch 369 could supply as much electricity as the electrical battery charged by thirty turns of the machine  373 the following arrangements and results are selected from many that were made and obtained relative to chemical action a platina wire one twelfth of an inch in diameter weighing two hundred and sixty grains had the extremity rendered plain so as to offer a definite surface equal to a circle of the same diameter as the wire it was then connected in turn with the conductor of the machine or with the voltaic apparatus 369 so as always to form the positive pole and at the same time retain a perpendicular position that it might rest with its whole weight upon the test paper to be employed the test paper itself was supported upon a platina spatula connected either with the discharging train 292 or with the negative wire of the voltaic apparatus and it consisted of four thicknesses moistened at all times to an equal degree in a standard solution of hydriodate of potassa 316  374 when the platina wire was connected with the prime conductor of the machine and the spatula with the discharging train ten turns of the machine had such decomposing power as to produce a pale round spot of iodine of the diameter of the wire twenty turns made a much darker mark and thirty turns made a dark brown spot penetrating to the second thickness of the paper the difference in effect produced by two or three turns more or less could be distinguished with facility  375 the wire and spatula were then connected with the voltaic apparatus 369 the galvanometer being also included in the arrangement and a stronger acid having been prepared consisting of nitric acid and water the voltaic apparatus was immersed so far as to give a permanent deflection of the needle to the 513 division 372 the fourfold moistened paper intervening as beforea then by shifting the end of the wire from place to place upon the test paper the effect of the current for five six seven or any number of the beats of the watch 369 was observed and compared with that of the machine after alternating and repeating the experiments of comparison many times it was constantly found that this standard current of voltaic electricity continued for eight beats of the watch was equal in chemical effect to thirty turns of the machine twentyeight revolutions of the machine were sensibly too few    a of course the heightened power of the voltaic battery was   necessary to compensate for the bad conductor now interposed  376 hence it results that both in magnetic deflection 371 and in chemical force the current of electricity of the standard voltaic battery for eight beats of the watch was equal to that of the machine evolved by thirty revolutions  377 it also follows that for this case of electrochemical decomposition and it is probable for all cases that the chemical power like the magnetic force 36 is in direct proportion to the absolute quantity of electricity which passes  378 hence arises still further confirmation if any were required of the identity of common and voltaic electricity and that the differences of intensity and quantity are quite sufficient to account for what were supposed to be their distinctive qualities  379 the extension which the present investigations have enabled me to make of the facts and views constituting the theory of electrochemical decomposition will with some other points of electrical doctrine be almost immediately submitted to the royal society in another series of these researches  royal institution 15th dec 1832  notei am anxious and am permitted to add to this paper a correction of an error which i have attributed to m ampère the first series of these experimental researches in referring to his experiment on the induction of electrical currents 78 i have called that a disc which i should have called a circle or a ring m ampère used a ring or a very short cylinder made of a narrow plate of copper bent into a circle and he tells me that by such an arrangement the motion is very readily obtained i have not doubted that m ampère obtained the motion he described but merely mistook the kind of mobile conductor used and so far i described his experiment erroneously  in the same paragraph i have stated that m ampère says the disc turned to take a position of equilibrium exactly as the spiral itself would have turned had it been free to move and further on i have said that my results tended to invert the sense of the proposition stated by m ampère that a current of electricity tends to put the electricity of conductors near which it passes in motion in the same direction m ampère tells me in a letter which i have just received from him that he carefully avoided when describing the experiment any reference to the direction of the induced current and on looking at the passages he quotes to me i find that to be the case i have therefore done him injustice in the above statements and am anxious to correct my error  but that it may not be supposed i lightly wrote those passages i will briefly refer to my reasons for understanding them in the sense i did at first the experiment failed when remade successfully about a year afterwards it was at geneva in company with ma de la rive the latter philosopher described the resultsa and says that the plate of copper bent into a circle which was used as the mobile conductor sometimes advanced between the two branches of the horseshoe magnet and sometimes was repelled according to the direction of the current in the surrounding conductors    a bibliothèque universelle xxi p 48  i have been in the habit of referring to demonferrands manuel delectricité dynamique as a book of authority in france containing the general results and laws of this branch of science up to the time of its publication in a well arranged form at p 173 the author when describing this experiment says the mobile circle turns to take a position of equilibrium as a conductor would do in which the current moved in the same direction as in the spiral and in the same paragraph he adds it is therefore proved that a current of electricity tends to put the electricity of conductors near which it passes in motion in the same direction these are the words i quoted in my paper 78  le lycée of 1st of january 1832 no 36 in an article written after the receipt of my first unfortunate letter to m hachette and before my papers were printed reasons upon the direction of the induced currents and says that there ought to be an elementary current produced in the same direction as the corresponding portion of the producing current a little further on it says therefore we ought to obtain currents moving in the same direction produced upon a metallic wire either by a magnet or a current m ampère was so thouroughly persuaded that such ought to be the direction of the currents by influence that he neglected to assure himself of it in his experiment at geneva  it was the precise statements in demonferrands manuel agreeing as they did with the expression in m de la rives paper which however i now understand as only meaning that when the inducing current was changed the motion of the mobile circle changed also and not in discordance with anything expressed by m ampère himself where he speaks of the experiment which made me conclude when i wrote the paper that what i wrote was really his avowed opinion and when the number of the lycée referred to appeared which was before my paper was printed it could excite no suspicion that i was in error  hence the mistake into which i unwittingly fell i am proud to correct it and do full justice to the acuteness and accuracy which as far as i can understand the subjects m ampère carries into all the branches of philosophy which he investigates  finally my note to 79 says that the lycée no 36 mistakes the erroneous results of mm fresnel and ampère for true ones c c in calling m ampères results erroneous i spoke of the results described in and referred to by the lycée itself but now that the expression of the direction of the induced current is to be separated the term erroneous ought no longer to be attached to them  april 29 1833 mf     fourth series   § 9 on a new law of

1358   1705dec 1838   380 it was during the progress of investigations relating to electrochemical decomposition which i still have to submit to the royal society that i encountered effects due to a very general law of electric conduction not hitherto recognised and though they prevented me from obtaining the condition i sought for they afforded abundant compensation for the momentary disappointment by the new and important interest which they gave to an extensive part of electrical science  381 i was working with ice and the solids resulting from the freezing of solutions arranged either as barriers across a substance to be decomposed or as the actual poles of a voltaic battery that i might trace and catch certain elements in their transit when i was suddenly stopped in my progress by finding that ice was in such circumstances a nonconductor of electricity and that as soon as a thin film of it was interposed in the circuit of a very powerful voltaic battery the transmission of electricity was prevented and all decomposition ceased  382 at first the experiments were made with common ice during the cold freezing weather of the latter end of january 1833 but the results were fallacious from the imperfection of the arrangements and the following more unexceptionable form of experiment was adopted  383 tin vessels were formed five inches deep one inch and a quarter wide in one direction of different widths from three eighths to five eighths of an inch in the other and open at one extremity into these were fixed by corks plates of platina so that the latter should not touch the tin cases and copper wires having previously been soldered to the plate these were easily connected when required with a voltaic pile then distilled water previously boiled for three hours was poured into the vessels and frozen by a mixture of salt and snow so that pure transparent solid ice intervened between the platina and tin and finally these metals were connected with the opposite extremities of the voltaic apparatus a galvanometer being at the same time included in the circuit  384 in the first experiment the platina pole was three inches and a half long and seven eighths of an inch wide it was wholly immersed in the water or ice and as the vessel was four eighths of an inch in width the average thickness of the intervening ice was only a quarter of an inch whilst the surface of contact with it at both poles was nearly fourteen square inches after the water was frozen the vessel was still retained in the frigorific mixture whilst contact between the tin and platina respectively was made with the extremities of a wellcharged voltaic battery consisting of twenty pairs of fourinch plates each with double coppers not the slightest deflection of the galvanometer needle occurred  385 on taking the frozen arrangement out of the cold mixture and applying warmth to the bottom of the tin case so as to melt part of the ice the connexion with the battery being in the mean time retained the needle did not at first move and it was only when the thawing process had extended so far as to liquefy part of the ice touching the platina pole that conduction took place but then it occurred effectually and the galvanometer needle was permanently deflected nearly 70°  386 in another experiment a platina spatula five inches in length and seven eighths of an inch in width had four inches fixed in the ice and the latter was only three sixteenths of an inch thick between one metallic surface and the other yet this arrangement insulated as perfectly as the former  387 upon pouring a little water in at the top of this vessel on the ice still the arrangement did not conduct yet fluid water was evidently there this result was the consequence of the cold metals having frozen the water where they touched it and thus insulating the fluid part and it well illustrates the nonconducting power of ice by showing how thin a film could prevent the transmission of the battery current upon thawing parts of this thin film at both metals conduction occurred  388 upon warming the tin case and removing the piece of ice it was found that a cork having slipped one of the edges of the platina had been all but in contact with the inner surface of the tin vessel yet notwithstanding the extreme thinness of the interfering ice in this place no sensible portion of electricity had passed  389 these experiments were repeated many times with the same results at last a battery of fifteen troughs or one hundred and fifty pairs of fourinch plates powerfully charged was used yet even here no sensible quantity of electricity passed the thin barrier of ice  390 it seemed at first as if occasional departures from these effects occurred but they could always be traced to some interfering circumstances the water should in every instance be wellfrozen for though it is not necessary that the ice should reach from pole to pole since a barrier of it about one pole would be quite sufficient to prevent conduction yet if part remain fluid the mere necessary exposure of the apparatus to the air or the approximation of the hands is sufficient to produce at the upper surface of the water and ice a film of fluid extending from the platina to the tin and then conduction occurs again if the corks used to block the platina in its place are damp or wet within it is necessary that the cold be sufficiently well applied to freeze the water in them or else when the surfaces of their contact with the tin become slightly warm by handling that part will conduct and the interior being ready to conduct also the current will pass the water should be pure not only that unembarrassed results may be obtained but also that as the freezing proceeds a minute portion of concentrated saline solution may not be formed which remaining fluid and being interposed in the ice or passing into cracks resulting from contraction may exhibit conducting powers independent of the ice itself  391 on one occasion i was surprised to find that after thawing much of the ice the conducting power had not been restored but i found that a cork which held the wire just where it joined the platina dipped so far into the ice that with the ice itself it protected the platina from contact with the melted part long after that contact was expected  392 this insulating power of ice is not effective with electricity of exalted intensity on touching a diverged goldleaf electrometer with a wire connected with the platina whilst the tin case was touched by the hand or another wire the electrometer was instantly discharged 419  393 but though electricity of an intensity so low that it cannot diverge the electrometer can still pass though in very limited quantities 419 through ice the comparative relation of water and ice to the electricity of the voltaic apparatus is not less extraordinary on that account or less important in its consequences  394 as it did not seem likely that this law of the assumption of conducting power during liquefaction and loss of it during congelation would be peculiar to water i immediately proceeded to ascertain its influence in other cases and found it to be very general for this purpose bodies were chosen which were solid at common temperatures but readily fusible and of such composition as for other reasons connected with electrochemical action led to the conclusion that they would be able when fused to replace water as conductors a voltaic battery of two troughs or twenty pairs of fourinch plates 384 was used as the source of electricity and a galvanometer introduced into the circuit to indicate the presence or absence of a current  395 on fusing a little chloride of lead by a spirit lamp on a fragment of a florence flask and introducing two platina wires connected with the poles of the battery there was instantly powerful action the galvanometer was most violently affected and the chloride rapidly decomposed on removing the lamp the instant the chloride solidified all current and consequent effects ceased though the platina wires remained inclosed in the chloride not more than the onesixteenth of an inch from each other on renewing the heat as soon as the fusion had proceeded far enough to allow liquid matter to connect the poles the electrical current instantly passed  396 on fusing the chloride with one wire introduced and then touching the liquid with the other the latter being cold caused a little knob to concrete on its extremity and no current passed it was only when the wire became so hot as to be able to admit or allow of contact with the liquid matter that conduction took place and then it was very powerful  397 when chloride of silver and chlorate of potassa were experimented with in a similar manner exactly the same results occurred  398 whenever the current passed in these cases there was decomposition of the substances but the electrochemical part of this subject i purpose connecting with more general views in a future papera    a in 1801 sir h davy knew that dry nitre caustic potash and   soda are conductors of galvanism when rendered fluid by a high degree   of heat journals of the royal institution 1802 p 53 but was   not aware of the general law which i have been engaged in developing   it is remarkable that eleven years after that he should say there   are no fluids known except such as contain water which are capable of   being made the medium of connexion between the metal or metals of the   voltaic apparatuselements of chemical philosophy p 169  399 other substances which could not be melted on glass were fused by the lamp and blowpipe on platina connected with one pole of the battery and then a wire connected with the other dipped into them in this way chloride of sodium sulphate of soda protoxide of lead mixed carbonates of potash and soda c c exhibited exactly the same phenomena as those already described whilst liquid they conducted and were decomposed whilst solid though very hot they insulated the battery current even when four troughs were used  400 occasionally the substances were contained in small bent tubes of green glass and when fused the platina poles introduced one on each side in such cases the same general results as those already described were procured but a further advantage was obtained namely that whilst the substance was conducting and suffering decomposition the final arrangement of the elements could be observed thus iodides of potassium and lead gave iodine at the positive pole and potassium or lead at the negative pole chlorides of lead and silver gave chlorine at the positive and metals at the negative pole nitre and chlorate of potassa gave oxygen c at the positive and alkali or even potassium at the negative pole  illustration  401 a fourth arrangement was used for substances requiring very high temperatures for their fusion a platina wire was connected with one pole of the battery its extremity bent into a small ring in the manner described by berzelius for blowpipe experiments a little of the salt glass or other substance was melted on this ring by the ordinary blowpipe or even in some cases by the oxyhydrogen blowpipe and when the drop retained in its place by the ring was thoroughly hot and fluid a platina wire from the opposite pole of the battery was made to touch it and the effects observed  402 the following are various substances taken from very different classes chemically considered which are subject to this law the list might no doubt be enormously extended but i have not had time to do more than confirm the law by a sufficient number of instances  first water  amongst oxidespotassa protoxide of lead glass of antimony protoxide of antimony oxide of bismuth  chlorides of potassium sodium barium strontium calcium magnesium manganese zinc copper proto lead tin proto antimony silver  iodides of potassium zinc and lead protiodide of tin periodide of mercury fluoride of potassium cyanide of potassium sulphocyanide of potassium  salts chlorate of potassa nitrates of potassa soda baryta strontia lead copper and silver sulphates of soda and lead protosulphate of mercury phosphates of potassa soda lead copper phosphoric glass or acid phosphate of lime carbonates of potassa and soda mingled and separate borax borate of lead perborate of tin chromate of potassa bichromate of potassa chromate of lead acetate of potassa  sulphurets sulphuret of antimony sulphuret of potassium made by reducing sulphate of potassa by hydrogen ordinary sulphuret of potassa  silicated potassa chameleon mineral  403 it is highly interesting in the instances of those substances which soften before they liquefy to observe at what period the conducting power is acquired and to what degree it is exalted by perfect fluidity thus with the borate of lead when heated by the lamp upon glass it becomes as soft as treacle but it did not conduct and it was only when urged by the blowpipe and brought to a fair red heat that it conducted when rendered quite liquid it conducted with extreme facility  404 i do not mean to deny that part of the increased conducting power in these cases of softening was probably due to the elevation of temperature 432 445 but i have no doubt that by far the greater part was due to the influence of the general law already demonstrated and which in these instances came gradually instead of suddenly into operation  405 the following are bodies which acquired no conducting power upon assuming the liquid state  sulphur phosphorus iodide of sulphur periodide of tin orpiment realgar glacial acetic acid mixed margaric and oleic acids artificial camphor caffeine sugar adipocire stearine of cocoanut oil spermaceti camphor naphthaline resin gum sandarach shell lac  406 perchloride of tin chloride of arsenic and the hydrated chloride of arsenic being liquids had no sensible conducting power indicated by the galvanometer nor were they decomposed  407 some of the above substances are sufficiently remarkable as exceptions to the general law governing the former cases these are orpiment realgar acetic acid artificial camphor periodide of tin and the chlorides of tin and arsenic i shall have occasion to refer to these cases in the paper on electrochemical decomposition  408 boracic acid was raised to the highest possible temperature by an oxyhydrogen flame 401 yet it gained no conducting powers sufficient to affect the galvanometer and underwent no apparent voltaic decomposition it seemed to be quite as bad a conductor as air green bottleglass heated in the same manner did not gain conducting power sensible to the galvanometer flint glass when highly heated did conduct a little and decompose and as the proportion of potash or oxide of lead was increased in the glass the effects were more powerful those glasses consisting of boracic acid on the one hand and oxide of lead or potassa on the other show the assumption of conducting power upon fusion and the accompanying decomposition very well  409 i was very anxious to try the general experiment with sulphuric acid of about specific gravity 1783 containing that proportion of water which gives it the power of crystallizing at 40° fahr but i found it impossible to obtain it so that i could be sure the whole would congeal even at 0° fahr a tenthousandth part of water more or less than necessary would upon cooling the whole cause a portion of uncongealable liquid to separate and that remaining in the interstices of the solid mass and moistening the planes of division would prevent the correct observation of the phenomena due to entire solidification and subsequent liquefaction  410 with regard to the substances on which conducting power is thus conferred by liquidity the degree of power so given is generally very great water is that body in which this acquired power is feeblest in the various oxides chlorides salts c c it is given in a much higher degree i have not had time to measure the conducting power in these cases but it is apparently some hundred times that of pure water the increased conducting power known to be given to water by the addition of salts would seem to be in a great degree dependent upon the high conducting power of these bodies when in the liquid state that state being given them for the time not by heat but solution in the watera    a see a doubt on this point at 1356dec 1838  411 whether the conducting power of these liquefied bodies is a consequence of their decomposition or not 413 or whether the two actions of conduction and decomposition are essentially connected or not would introduce no difference affecting the probable accuracy of the preceding statement  412 this general assumption of conducting power by bodies as soon as they pass from the solid to the liquid state offers a new and extraordinary character the existence of which as far as i know has not before been suspected and it seems importantly connected with some properties and relations of the particles of matter which i may now briefly point out  413 in almost all the instances as yet observed which are governed by this law the substances experimented with have been those which were not only compound bodies but such as contain elements known to arrange themselves at the opposite poles and were also such as could be decomposed by the electrical current when conduction took place decomposition occurred when decomposition ceased conduction ceased also and it becomes a fair and an important question whether the conduction itself may not wherever the law holds good be a consequence not merely of the capability but of the act of decomposition and that question may be accompanied by another namely whether solidification does not prevent conduction merely by chaining the particles to their places under the influence of aggregation and preventing their final separation in the manner necessary for decomposition  414 but on the other hand there is one substance and others may occur the periodide of mercury which being experimented with like the others 400 was found to insulate when solid and to acquire conducting power when fluid yet it did not seem to undergo decomposition in the latter case  415 again there are many substances which contain elements such as would be expected to arrange themselves at the opposite poles of the pile and therefore in that respect fitted for decomposition which yet do not conduct amongst these are the iodide of sulphur periodide of zinc perchloride of tin chloride of arsenic hydrated chloride of arsenic acetic acid orpiment realgar artificial camphor c and from these it might perhaps be assumed that decomposition is dependent upon conducting power and not the latter upon the former the true relation however of conduction and decomposition in those bodies governed by the general law which it is the object of this paper to establish can only be satisfactorily made out from a far more extensive series of observations than those i have yet been able to supplya    a see 673 c cdec 1838  416 the relation under this law of the conducting power for electricity to that for heat is very remarkable and seems to imply a natural dependence of the two as the solid becomes a fluid it loses almost entirely the power of conduction for heat but gains in a high degree that for electricity but as it reverts hack to the solid state it gains the power of conducting heat and loses that of conducting electricity if therefore the properties are not incompatible still they are most strongly contrasted one being lost as the other is gained we may hope perhaps hereafter to understand the physical reason of this very extraordinary relation of the two conducting powers both of which appear to be directly connected with the corpuscular condition of the substances concerned  417 the assumption of conducting power and a decomposable condition by liquefaction promises new opportunities of and great facilities in voltaic decomposition thus such bodies as the oxides chlorides cyanides sulphocyanides fluorides certain vitreous mixtures c c may be submitted to the action of the voltaic battery under new circumstances and indeed i have already been able with ten pairs of plates to decompose common salt chloride of magnesium borax c c and to obtain sodium magnesium boron c in their separate states   § 10 on conducting power generallya    a in reference to this § refer to 983 in series viii and the   results connected with itdec 1838   418 it is not my intention here to enter into an examination of all the circumstances connected with conducting power but to record certain facts and observations which have arisen during recent inquiries as additions to the general stock of knowledge relating to this point of electrical science  419 i was anxious in the first place to obtain some idea of the conducting power of ice and solid salts for electricity of high tension 392 that a comparison might be made between it and the large accession of the same power gained upon liquefaction for this purpose the large electrical machine 290 was brought into excellent action its conductor connected with a delicate goldleaf electrometer and also with the platina inclosed in the ice 383 whilst the tin case was connected with the discharging train 292 on working the machine moderately the gold leaves barely separated on working it rapidly they could be opened nearly two inches in this instance the tin case was fiveeighths of an inch in width and as after the experiment the platina plate was found very nearly in the middle of the ice the average thickness of the latter had been fivesixteenths of an inch and the extent of surface of contact with tin and platina fourteen square inches 384 yet under these circumstances it was but just able to conduct the small quantity of electricity which this machine could evolve 371 even when of a tension competent to open the leaves two inches no wonder therefore that it could not conduct any sensible portion of the electricity of the troughs 384 which though almost infinitely surpassing that of the machine in quantity had a tension so low as not to be sensible to an electrometer  420 in another experiment the tin case was only foureighths of an inch in width and it was found afterwards that the platina had been not quite oneeighth of an inch distant in the ice from one side of the tin vessel when this was introduced into the course of the electricity from the machine 419 the gold leaves could be opened but not more than half an inch the thinness of the ice favouring the conduction of the electricity and permitting the same quantity to pass in the same time though of a much lower tension  421 iodide of potassium which had been fused and cooled was introduced into the course of the electricity from the machine there were two pieces each about a quarter of an inch in thickness and exposing a surface on each side equal to about half a square inch these were placed upon platina plates one connected with the machine and electrometer 419 and the other with the discharging train whilst a fine platina wire connected the two pieces resting upon them by its two points on working the electrical machine it was possible to open the electrometer leaves about twothirds of an inch  422 as the platina wire touched only by points the facts show that this salt is a far better conductor than ice but as the leaves of the electrometer opened it is also evident with what difficulty conduction even of the small portion of electricity produced by the machine is effected by this body in the solid state when compared to the facility with which enormous quantities at very low tensions are transmitted by it when in the fluid state  423 in order to confirm these results by others obtained from the voltaic apparatus a battery of one hundred and fifty plates four inches square was wellcharged its action was good the shock from it strong the discharge would continue from copper to copper through fourtenths of an inch of air and the goldleaf electrometer before used could be opened nearly a quarter of an inch  424 the ice vessel employed 420 was half an inch in width as the extent of contact of the ice with the tin and platina was nearly fourteen square inches the whole was equivalent to a plate of ice having a surface of seven square inches of perfect contact at each side and only one fourth of an inch thick it was retained in a freezing mixture during the experiment  425 the order of arrangement in the course of the electric current was as follows the positive pole of the battery was connected by a wire with the platina plate in the ice the plate was in contact with the ice the ice with the tin jacket the jacket with a wire which communicated with a piece of tin foil on which rested one end of a bent platina wire 312 the other or decomposing end being supported on paper moistened with solution of iodide of potassium 316 the paper was laid flat on a platina spatula connected with the negative end of the battery all that part of the arrangement between the ice vessel and the decomposing wire point including both these was insulated so that no electricity might pass through the latter which had not traversed the former also  426 under these circumstances it was found that a pale brown spot of iodine was slowly formed under the decomposing platina point thus indicating that ice could conduct a little of the electricity evolved by a voltaic battery charged up to the degree of intensity indicated by the electrometer but it is quite evident that notwithstanding the enormous quantity of electricity which the battery could furnish it was under present circumstances a very inferior instrument to the ordinary machine for the latter could send as much through the ice as it could carry being of a far higher intensity ie able to open the electrometer leaves half an inch or more 419 420  427 the decomposing wire and solution of iodide of potassium were then removed and replaced by a very delicate galvanometer 205 it was so nearly astatic that it vibrated to and fro in about sixtythree beats of a watch giving one hundred and fifty beats in a minute the same feebleness of current as before was still indicated the galvanometer needle was deflected but it required to break and make contact three or four times 297 before the effect was decided  428 the galvanometer being removed two platina plates were connected with the extremities of the wires and the tongue placed between them so that the whole charge of the battery so far as the ice would let it pass was free to go through the tongue whilst standing on the stone floor there was shock c but when insulated i could feel no sensation i think a frog would have been scarcely if at all affected  429 the ice was now removed and experiments made with other solid bodies for which purpose they were placed under the end of the decomposing wire instead of the solution of iodide of potassium 125 for instance a piece of dry iodide of potassium was placed on the spatula connected with the negative pole of the battery and the point of the decomposing wire placed upon it whilst the positive end of the battery communicated with the latter a brown spot of iodine very slowly appeared indicating the passage of a little electricity and agreeing in that respect with the results obtained by the use of the electrical machine 421 when the galvanometer was introduced into the circuit at the same time with the iodide it was with difficulty that the action of the current on it could be rendered sensible  430 a piece of common salt previously fused and solidified being introduced into the circuit was sufficient almost entirely to destroy the action on the galvanometer fused and cooled chloride of lead produced the same effect the conducting power of these bodies when fluid is very great 395 402  431 these effects produced by using the common machine and the voltaic battery agree therefore with each other and with the law laid down in this paper 394 and also with the opinion i have supported in the third series of these researches of the identity of electricity derived from different sources 360  432 the effect of heat in increasing the conducting power of many substances especially for electricity of high tension is well known i have lately met with an extraordinary case of this kind for electricity of low tension or that of the voltaic pile and which is in direct contrast with the influence of heat upon metallic bodies as observed and described by sir humphry davya    a philosophical transactions 1821 p 131  433 the substance presenting this effect is sulphuret of silver it was made by fusing a mixture of precipitated silver and sublimed sulphur removing the film of silver by a file from the exterior of the fused mass pulverizing the sulphuret mingling it with more sulphur and fusing it again in a green glass tube so that no air should obtain access during the process the surface of the sulphuret being again removed by a file or knife it was considered quite free from uncombined silver  434 when a piece of this sulphuret half an inch in thickness was put between surfaces of platina terminating the poles of a voltaic battery of twenty pairs of fourinch plates a galvanometer being also included in the circuit the needle was slightly deflected indicating a feeble conducting power on pressing the platina poles and sulphuret together with the fingers the conducting power increased as the whole became warm on applying a lamp under the sulphuret between the poles the conducting power rose rapidly with the heat and at lastthe galvanometer needle jumped into a fixed position and the sulphuret was found conducting in the manner of a metal on removing the lamp and allowing the heat to fall the effects were reversed the needle at first began to vibrate a little then gradually left its transverse direction and at last returned to a position very nearly that which it would take when no current was passing through the galvanometer  435 occasionally when the contact of the sulphuret with the platina poles was good the battery freshly charged and the commencing temperature not too low the mere current of electricity from the battery was sufficient to raise the temperature of the sulphuret and then without any application of extraneous heat it went on increasing conjointly in temperature and conducting power until the cooling influence of the air limited the effects in such cases it was generally necessary to cool the whole purposely to show the returning series of phenomena  436 occasionally also the effects would sink of themselves and could not be renewed until a fresh surface of the sulphuret had been applied to the positive pole this was in consequence of peculiar results of decomposition to which i shall have occasion to revert in the section on electrochemical decomposition and was conveniently avoided by inserting the ends of two pieces of platina wire into the opposite extremities of a portion of sulphuret fused in a glass tube and placing this arrangement between the poles of the battery  437 the hot sulphuret of silver conducts sufficiently well to give a bright spark with charcoal c c in the manner of a metal  438 the native grey sulphuret of silver and the ruby silver ore both presented the same phenomena the native malleable sulphuret of silver presented precisely the same appearances as the artificial sulphuret  439 there is no other body with which i am acquainted that like sulphuret of silver can compare with metals in conducting power for electricity of low tension when hot but which unlike them during cooling loses in power whilst they on the contrary gain probably however many others may when sought for be founda    a see now on this subject 1340 1341dec 1838  440 the protosulphuret of iron the native persulphuret of iron arsenical sulphuret of iron native yellow sulphuret of copper and iron grey artificial sulphuret of copper artificial sulphuret of bismuth and artificial grey sulphuret of tin all conduct the voltaic battery current when cold more or less some giving sparks like the metals others not being sufficient for that high effect they did not seem to conduct better when heated than before but i had not time to enter accurately into the investigation of this point almost all of them became much heated by the transmission of the current and present some very interesting phenomena in that respect the sulphuret of antimony does not conduct the same current sensibly either hot or cold but is amongst those bodies acquiring conducting power when fused 402 the sulphuret of silver and perhaps some others decompose whilst in the solid state but the phenomena of this decomposition will be reserved for its proper place in the next series of these researches  441 notwithstanding the extreme dissimilarity between sulphuret of silver and gases or vapours i cannot help suspecting the action of heat upon them to be the same bringing them all into the same class as conductors of electricity although with those great differences in degree which are found to exist under common circumstances when gases are heated they increase in conducting power both for common and voltaic electricity 271 and it is probable that if we could compress and condense them at the same time we should still further increase their conducting power cagniard de la tour has shown that a substance for instance water may be so expanded by heat whilst in the liquid state or condensed whilst in the vaporous state that the two states shall coincide at one point and the transition from one to the other be so gradual that no line of demarcation can be pointed outa that in fact the two states shall become onewhich one state presents us at different times with differences in degree as to certain properties and relations and which differences are under ordinary circumstances so great as to be equivalent to two different states    a annales de chimie xxi pp 127 178  442 i cannot but suppose at present that at that point where the liquid and the gaseous state coincide the conducting properties are the same for both but that they diminish as the expansion of the matter into a rarer form takes place by the removal of the necessary pressure still however retaining as might be expected the capability of having what feeble conducting power remains increased by the action of heat  443 i venture to give the following summary of the conditions of electric conduction in bodies not however without fearing that i may have omitted some important pointsa    a see now in relation to this subject 13201242dec 1838  444 all bodies conduct electricity in the same manner from metals to lac and gases but in very different degrees  445 conducting power is in some bodies powerfully increased by heat and in others diminished yet without our perceiving any accompanying essential electrical difference either in the bodies or in the changes occasioned by the electricity conducted  446 a numerous class of bodies insulating electricity of low intensity when solid conduct it very freely when fluid and are then decomposed by it  447 but there are many fluid bodies which do not sensibly conduct electricity of this low intensity there are some which conduct it and are not decomposed nor is fluidity essential to decompositiona    a see the next series of these experimental researches  448 there is but one body yet discovereda which insulating a voltaic current when solid and conducting it when fluid is not decomposed in the latter case 414    a it is just possible that this case may by more delicate   experiment hereafter disappear see now 1340 1341 in relation to   this notedec 1838  449 there is no strict electrical distinction of conduction which can as yet be drawn between bodies supposed to be elementary and those known to be compounds

iii theory of electrochemical decomposition  received june 18read june 20 1833   § 11 on electrochemical decompositiona    a refer to the note after 1047 series viiidec 1838   450 i have in a recent series of these researches 265 proved to my own satisfaction at least the identity of electricities derived from different sources and have especially dwelt upon the proofs of the sameness of those obtained by the use of the common electrical machine and the voltaic battery  451 the great distinction of the electricities obtained from these two sources is the very high tension to which the small quantity obtained by aid of the machine may be raised and the enormous quantity 371 376 in which that of comparatively low tension supplied by the voltaic battery may be procured but as their actions whether magnetical chemical or of any other nature are essentially the same 360 it appeared evident that we might reason from the former as to the manner of action of the latter and it was to me a probable consequence that the use of electricity of such intensity as that afforded by the machine would when applied to effect and elucidate electrochemical decomposition show some new conditions of that action evolve new views of the internal arrangements and changes of the substances under decomposition and perhaps give efficient powers over matter as yet undecomposed  452 for the purpose of rendering the bearings of the different parts of this series of researches more distinct i shall divide it into several heads   ¶ i new conditions of electrochemical decomposition  453 the tension of machine electricity causes it however small in quantity to pass through any length of water solutions or other substances classing with these as conductors as fast as it can be produced and therefore in relation to quantity as fast as it could have passed through much shorter portions of the same conducting substance with the voltaic battery the case is very different and the passing current of electricity supplied by it suffers serious diminution in any substance by considerable extension of its length but especially in such bodies as those mentioned above  454 i endeavoured to apply this facility of transmitting the current of electricity through any length of a conductor to an investigation of the transfer of the elements in a decomposing body in contrary directions towards the poles the general form of apparatus used in these experiments has been already described 312 316 and also a particular experiment 319 in which when a piece of litmus paper and a piece of turmeric paper were combined and moistened in solution of sulphate of soda the point of the wire from the machine representing the positive pole put upon the litmus paper and the receiving point from the discharging train 292 316 representing the negative pole upon the turmeric paper a very few turns of the machine sufficed to show the evolution of acid at the former and alkali at the latter exactly in the manner effected by a voltaelectric current  455 the pieces of litmus and turmeric paper were now placed each upon a separate plate of glass and connected by an insulated string four feet long moistened in the same solution of sulphate of soda the terminal decomposing wire points were placed upon the papers as before on working the machine the same evolution of acid and alkali appeared as in the former instance and with equal readiness notwithstanding that the places of their appearance were four feet apart from each other finally a piece of string seventy feet long was used it was insulated in the air by suspenders of silk so that the electricity passed through its entire length decomposition took place exactly as in former cases alkali and acid appearing at the two extremities in their proper places  456 experiments were then made both with sulphate of soda and iodide of potassium to ascertain if any diminution of decomposing effect was produced by such great extension as those just described of the moist conductor or body under decomposition but whether the contact of the decomposing point connected with the discharging train was made with turmeric paper touching the prime conductor or with other turmeric paper connected with it through the seventy feet of string the spot of alkali for an equal number of turns of the machine had equal intensity of colour the same results occurred at the other decomposing wire whether the salt or the iodide were used and it was fully proved that this great extension of the distance between the poles produced no effect whatever on the amount of decomposition provided the same quantity of electricity were passed in both cases 377  457 the negative point of the discharging train the turmeric paper and the string were then removed the positive point was left resting upon the litmus paper and the latter touched by a piece of moistened string held in the hand a few turns of the machine evolved acid at the positive point as freely as before  458 the end of the moistened string instead of being held in the hand was suspended by glass in the air on working the machine the electricity proceeded from the conductor through the wire point to the litmus paper and thence away by the intervention of the string to the air so that there was as in the last experiment but one metallic pole still acid was evolved there as freely as in any former case  459 when any of these experiments were repeated with electricity from the negative conductor corresponding effects were produced whether one or two decomposing wires were used the results were always constant considered in relation to the direction of the electric current  460 these experiments were varied so as to include the action of only one metallic pole but that not the pole connected with the machine turmeric paper was moistened in solution of sulphate of soda placed upon glass and connected with the discharging train 292 by a decomposing wire 312 a piece of wet string was hung from it the lower extremity of which was brought opposite a point connected with the positive prime conductor of the machine the machine was then worked for a few turns and alkali immediately appeared at the point of the discharging train which rested on the turmeric paper corresponding effects took place at the negative conductor of a machine  461 these cases are abundantly sufficient to show that electrochemical decomposition does not depend upon the simultaneous action of two metallic poles since a single pole might be used decomposition ensue and one or other of the elements liberated pass to the pole according as it was positive or negative in considering the course taken by and the final arrangement of the other element i had little doubt that i should find it had receded towards the other extremity and that the air itself had acted as a pole an expectation which was fully confirmed in the following manner  462 a piece of turmeric paper not more than 04 of an inch in length and 05 of an inch in width was moistened with sulphate of soda and placed upon the edge of a glass plate opposite to and about two inches from a point connected with the discharging train plate iv fig 47 a piece of tinfoil resting upon the same glass plate was connected with the machine and also with the turmeric paper by a decomposing wire a 312 the machine was then worked the positive electricity passing into the turmeric paper at the point p and out at the extremity n after forty or fifty turns of the machine the extremity n was examined and the two points or angles found deeply coloured by the presence of free alkali fig 48  463 a similar piece of litmus paper dipped in solution of sulphate of soda n fig 49 was now supported upon the end of the discharging train a and its extremity brought opposite to a point p connected with the conductor of the machine after working the machine for a short time acid was developed at both the corners towards the point ie at both the corners receiving the electricities from the air every precaution was taken to prevent this acid from being formed by sparks or brushes passing through the air 322 and these with the accompanying general facts are sufficient to show that the acid was really the result of electrochemical decomposition 466  464 then a long piece of turmeric paper large at one end and pointed at the other was moistened in the saline solution and immediately connected with the conductor of the machine so that its pointed extremity was opposite a point upon the discharging train when the machine was worked alkali was evolved at that point and even when the discharging train was removed and the electricity left to be diffused and carried off altogether by the air still alkali was evolved where the electricity left the turmeric paper  465 arrangements were then made in which no metallic communication with the decomposing matter was allowed but both poles if they might now be called by that name formed of air only a piece of turmeric paper a fig 50 and a piece of litmus paper b were dipped in solution of sulphate of soda put together so as to form one moist pointed conductor and supported on wax between two needle points one p connected by a wire with the conductor of the machine and the other n with the discharging train the interval in each case between the points was about half an inch the positive point p was opposite the litmus paper the negative point n opposite the turmeric the machine was then worked for a time upon which evidence of decomposition quickly appeared for the point of the litmus b became reddened from acid evolved there and the point of the turmeric a red from a similar and simultaneous evolution of alkali  466 upon turning the paper conductor round so that the litmus point should now give off the positive electricity and the turmeric point receive it and working the machine for a short time both the red spots disappeared and as on continuing the action of the machine no red spot was reformed at the litmus extremity it proved that in the first instance 463 the effect was not due to the action of brushes or mere electric discharges causing the formation of nitric acid from the air 322  467 if the combined litmus and turmeric paper in this experiment be considered as constituting a conductor independent of the machine or the discharging train and the final places of the elements evolved be considered in relation to this conductor then it will be found that the acid collects at the negative or receiving end or pole of the arrangement and the alkali at the positive or delivering extremity  468 similar litmus and turmeric paper points were now placed upon glass plates and connected by a string six feet long both string and paper being moistened in solution of sulphate of soda a needle point connected with the machine was brought opposite the litmus paper point and another needle point connected with the discharging train brought opposite the turmeric paper on working the machine acid appeared on the litmus and alkali on the turmeric paper but the latter was not so abundant as in former cases for much of the electricity passed off from the string into the air and diminished the quantity discharged at the turmeric point  469 finally a series of four small compound conductors consisting of litmus and turmeric paper fig 51 moistened in solution of sulphate of soda were supported on glass rods in a line at a little distance from each other between the points p and n of the machine and discharging train so that the electricity might pass in succession through them entering in at the litmus points b b and passing out at the turmeric points a a on working the machine carefully so as to avoid sparks and brushes 322 i soon obtained evidence of decomposition in each of the moist conductors for all the litmus points exhibited free acid and the turmeric points equally showed free alkali  470 on using solutions of iodide of potassium acetate of lead c similar effects were obtained but as they were all consistent with the results above described i refrain from describing the appearances minutely  471 these cases of electrochemical decomposition are in their nature exactly of the same kind as those affected under ordinary circumstances by the voltaic battery notwithstanding the great differences as to the presence or absence or at least as to the nature of the parts usually called poles and also of the final situation of the elements eliminated at the electrified boundary surfaces 467 they indicate at once an internal action of the parts suffering decomposition and appear to show that the power which is effectual in separating the elements is exerted there and not at the poles but i shall defer the consideration of this point for a short time 493 518 that i may previously consider another supposed condition of electrochemical decompositiona    a i find since making and describing these results from a note to   sir humphry davys paper in the philosophical transactions 1807 p   31 that that philosopher in repeating wollastons experiment of the   decomposition of water by common electricity 327 330 used an   arrangement somewhat like some of those i have described he immersed   a guarded platina point connected with the machine in distilled water   and dissipated the electricity from the water into the air by   moistened filaments of cotton in this way he states that he obtained   oxygen and hydrogen separately from each other this experiment had   i known of it ought to have been quoted in an earlier series of these   researches 342 but it does not remove any of the objections i have   made to the use of wollastons apparatus as a test of true chemical   action 331   ¶ ii influence of water in electrochemical decomposition  472 it is the opinion of several philosophers that the presence of water is essential in electrochemical decomposition and also for the evolution of electricity in the voltaic battery itself as the decomposing cell is merely one of the cells of the battery into which particular substances are introduced for the purpose of experiment it is probable that what is an essential condition in the one case is more or less so in the other the opinion therefore that water is necessary to decomposition may have been founded on the statement made by sir humphry davy that there are no fluids known except such as contain water which are capable of being made the medium of connexion between the metals or metal of the voltaic apparatusa and again when any substance rendered fluid by heat consisting of water oxygen and inflammable or metallic matter is exposed to those wires similar phenomena of decomposition occurb    a elements of chemical philosophy p 160 c    b ibid pp 144 145  473 this opinion has i think been shown by other philosophers not to be accurate though i do not know where to refer for a contradiction of it sir humphry davy himself said in 1801a that dry nitre caustic potash and soda are conductors of galvanism when rendered fluid by a high degree of heat but he must have considered them or the nitre at least as not suffering decomposition for the statements above were made by him eleven years subsequently in 1826 he also pointed out that bodies not containing water as fused litharge and chlorate of potassa were sufficient to form with platina and zinc powerful electromotive circlesb but he is here speaking of the production of electricity in the pile and not of its effects when evolved nor do his words at all imply that any correction of his former distinct statements relative to decomposition was required    a journal of the royal institution 1802 p 53    b philosophical transactions 1826 p 406  474 i may refer to the last series of these experimental researches 380 402 as setting the matter at rest by proving that there are hundreds of bodies equally influential with water in this respect that amongst binary compounds oxides chlorides iodides and even sulphurets 402 were effective and that amongst more complicated compounds cyanides and salts of equal efficacy occurred in great numbers 402  475 water therefore is in this respect merely one of a very numerous class of substances instead of being the only one and essential and it is of that class one of the worst as to its capability of facilitating conduction and suffering decomposition the reasons why it obtained for a time an exclusive character which it so little deserved are evident and consist in the general necessity of a fluid condition 394 in its being the only one of this class of bodies existing in the fluid state at common temperatures its abundant supply as the great natural solvent and its constant use in that character in philosophical investigations because of its having a smaller interfering injurious or complicating action upon the bodies either dissolved or evolved than any other substance  476 the analogy of the decomposing or experimental cell to the other cells of the voltaic battery renders it nearly certain that any of those substances which are decomposable when fluid as described in my last paper 402 would if they could be introduced between the metallic plates of the pile be equally effectual with water if not more so sir humphry davy found that litharge and chlorate of potassa were thus effectuala i have constructed various voltaic arrangements and found the above conclusion to hold good when any of the following substances in a fused state were interposed between copper and platina voltaic action more or less powerful was produced nitre chlorate of potassa carbonate of potassa sulphate of soda chloride of lead of sodium of bismuth of calcium iodide of lead oxide of bismuth oxide of lead the electric current was in the same direction as if acids had acted upon the metals when any of the same substances or phosphate of soda were made to act on platina and iron still more powerful voltaic combinations of the same kind were produced when either nitrate of silver or chloride of silver was the fluid substance interposed there was voltaic action but the electric current was in the reverse direction    a philosophical transactions 1826 p 406  iii theory of electrochemical decomposition  477 the extreme beauty and value of electrochemical decompositions have given to that power which the voltaic pile possesses of causing their occurrence an interest surpassing that of any other of its properties for the power is not only intimately connected with the continuance if not with the production of the electrical phenomena but it has furnished us with the most beautiful demonstrations of the nature of many compound bodies has in the hands of becquerel been employed in compounding substances has given us several new combinations and sustains us with the hope that when thoroughly understood it will produce many more  478 what may be considered as the general facts of electrochemical decomposition are agreed to by nearly all who have written on the subject they consist in the separation of the decomposable substance acted upon into its proximate or sometimes ultimate principles whenever both poles of the pile are in contact with that substance in a proper condition in the evolution of these principles at distant points ie at the poles of the pile where they are either finally set free or enter into union with the substance of the poles and in the constant determination of the evolved elements or principles to particular poles according to certain wellascertained laws  479 but the views of men of science vary much as to the nature of the action by which these effects are produced and as it is certain that we shall be better able to apply the power when we really understand the manner in which it operates this difference of opinion is a strong inducement to further inquiry i have been led to hope that the following investigations might be considered not as an increase of that which is doubtful but a real addition to this branch of knowledge  480 it will be needful that i briefly state the views of electrochemical decomposition already put forth that their present contradictory and unsatisfactory state may be seen before i give that which seems to me more accurately to agree with facts and i have ventured to discuss them freely trusting that i should give no offence to their highminded authors for i felt convinced that if i were right they would be pleased that their views should serve as steppingstones for the advance of science and that if i were wrong they would excuse the zeal which misled me since it was exerted for the service of that great cause whose prosperity and progress they have desired  481 grotthuss in the year 1805 wrote expressly on the decomposition of liquids by voltaic electricitya he considers the pile as an electric magnet ie as an attractive and repulsive agent the poles having attractive and repelling powers the pole from whence resinous electricity issues attracts hydrogen and repels oxygen whilst that from which vitreous electricity proceeds attracts oxygen and repels hydrogen so that each of the elements of a particle of water for instance is subject to an attractive and a repulsive force acting in contrary directions the centres of action of which are reciprocally opposed the action of each force in relation to a molecule of water situated in the course of the electric current is in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance at which it is exerted thus giving it is stated for such a molecule a constant forceb he explains the appearance of the elements at a distance from each other by referring to a succession of decompositions and recompositions occurring amongst the intervening particlesc and he thinks it probable that those which are about to separate at the poles unite to the two electricities there and in consequence become gasesd    a annales de chimie 1806 tom lviii p 64    b ibid pp 66 67 also tom lxiii p 20    c ibid tom lviii p 68 tom lxiii p 20    d ibid tom lxiii p 34  482 sir humphry davys celebrated bakerian lecture on some chemical agencies of electricity was read in november 1806 and is almost entirely occupied in the consideration of electrochemical decompositions the facts are of the utmost value and with the general points established are universally known the mode of action by which the effects take place is stated very generally so generally indeed that probably a dozen precise schemes of electrochemical action might be drawn up differing essentially from each other yet all agreeing with the statement there given  483 when sir humphry davy uses more particular expressions he seems to refer the decomposing effects to the attractions of the poles this is the case in the general expression of facts given at pp 28 and 29 of the philosophical transactions for 1807 also at p 30 again at p 160 of the elements of chemical philosophy he speaks of the great attracting powers of the surfaces of the poles he mentions the probability of a succession of decompositions and recompositions throughout the fluidagreeing in that respect with grotthussa and supposes that the attractive and repellent agencies may be communicated from the metallic surfaces throughout the whole of the menstruumb being communicated from one particle to another particle of the same kindc and diminishing in strength from the place of the poles to the middle point which is necessarily neutrald in reference to this diminution of power at increased distances from the poles he states that in a circuit of ten inches of water solution of sulphate of potassa placed four inches from the positive pole did not decompose whereas when only two inches from that pole it did render up its elementse    a philosophical transactions 1807 pp 29 30    b ibid p 39    c ibid p 29    d ibid p 42    e ibid p 42  484 when in 1826 sir humphry davy wrote again on this subject he stated that he found nothing to alter in the fundamental theory laid down in the original communicationa and uses the terms attraction and repulsion apparently in the same sense as beforeb    a philosophical transactions 1826 p 383    b ibid pp 389 407 115  485 messrs riffault and chompré experimented on this subject in 1807 they came to the conclusion that the voltaic current caused decompositions throughout its whole course in the humid conductor not merely as preliminary to the recompositions spoken of by grotthuss and davy but producing final separation of the elements in the course of the current and elsewhere than at the poles they considered the negative current as collecting and carrying the acids c to the positive pole and the positive current as doing the same duty with the bases and collecting them at the negative pole they likewise consider the currents as more powerful the nearer they are to their respective poles and state that the positive current is superior in power to the negative currenta    a annales de chimie 1807 tom lxiii p 83 c  486 m biot is very cautious in expressing an opinion as to the cause of the separation of the elements of a compound bodya but as far as the effects can be understood he refers them to the opposite electrical states of the portions of the decomposing substance in the neighbourhood of the two poles the fluid is most positive at the positive pole that state gradually diminishes to the middle distance where the fluid is neutral or not electrical but from thence to the negative pole it becomes more and more negativeb when a particle of salt is decomposed at the negative pole the acid particle is considered as acquiring a negative electrical state from the pole stronger than that of the surrounding undecomposed particles and is therefore repelled from amongst them and from out of that portion of the liquid towards the positive pole towards which also it is drawn by the attraction of the pole itself and the particles of positive undecomposed fluid around itc    a précis elémentaire de physique 3me édition 1824 tom i p 641    b ibid p 637    c ibid pp 641 642  487 m biot does not appear to admit the successive decompositions and recompositions spoken of by grotthuss davy c c but seems to consider the substance whilst in transit as combined with or rather attached to the electricity for the timea and though it communicates this electricity to the surrounding undecomposed matter with which it is in contact yet it retains during the transit a little superiority with respect to that kind which it first received from the pole and is by virtue of that difference carried forward through the fluid to the opposite poleb    a précis elémentaire de physique 3me édition 1824 tom i p 636    b ibid p 642  488 this theory implies that decomposition takes place at both poles upon distinct portions of fluid and not at all in the intervening parts the latter serve merely as imperfect conductors which assuming an electric state urge particles electrified more highly at the poles through them in opposite directions by virtue of a series of ordinary electrical attractions and repulsionsa    a précis elémentaire de physique 3me édition 1824 tom i pp   638 642  489 ma de la rive investigated this subject particularly and published a paper on it in 1825a he thinks those who have referred the phenomena to the attractive powers of the poles rather express the general fact than give any explication of it he considers the results as due to an actual combination of the elements or rather of half of them with the electricities passing from the poles in consequence of a kind of play of affinities between the matter and electricityb the current from the positive pole combining with the hydrogen or the bases it finds there leaves the oxygen and acids at liberty but carries the substances it is united with across to the negative pole where because of the peculiar character of the metal as a conductorc it is separated from them entering the metal and leaving the hydrogen or bases upon its surface in the same manner the electricity from the negative pole sets the hydrogen and bases which it finds there free but combines with the oxygen and acids carries them across to the positive pole and there deposits

490 m de la rive considers the portions of matter which are decomposed to be those contiguous to both polesa he does not admit with others the successive decompositions and recompositions in the whole course of the electricity through the humid conductorb but thinks the middle parts are in themselves unaltered or at least serve only to conduct the two contrary currents of electricity and matter which set off from the opposite polesc the decomposition therefore of a particle of water or a particle of salt may take place at either pole and when once effected it is final for the time no recombination taking place except the momentary union of the transferred particle with the electricity be so considered    a annales de chimie tom xxviii pp 197 198    b ibid pp 192 199    c ibid p 200  491 the latest communication that i am aware of on the subject is by m hachette its date is october 1832a it is incidental to the description of the decomposition of water by the magnetoelectric currents 346 one of the results of the experiment is that it is not necessary as has been supposed that for the chemical decomposition of water the action of the two electricities positive and negative should be simultaneous    a annales de chimie tom xxviii tom li p 73  492 it is more than probable that many other views of electrochemical decomposition may have been published and perhaps amongst them some which differing from those above might even in my own opinion were i acquainted with them obviate the necessity for the publication of my views if such be the case i have to regret my ignorance of them and apologize to the authors                                       493 that electrochemical decomposition does not depend upon any direct attraction and repulsion of the poles meaning thereby the metallic terminations either of the voltaic battery or ordinary electrical machine arrangements 312 upon the elements in contact with or near to them appeared very evident from the experiments made in air 462 465 c when the substances evolved did not collect about any poles but in obedience to the direction of the current were evolved and i would say ejected at the extremities of the decomposing substance but notwithstanding the extreme dissimilarity in the character of air and metals and the almost total difference existing between them as to their mode of conducting electricity and becoming charged with it it might perhaps still be contended although quite hypothetically that the bounding portions of air were now the surfaces or places of attraction as the metals had been supposed to be before in illustration of this and other points i endeavoured to devise an arrangement by which i could decompose a body against a surface of water as well as against air or metal and succeeded in doing so unexceptionably in the following manner as the experiment for very natural reasons requires many precautions to be successful and will be referred to hereafter in illustration of the views i shall venture to give i must describe it minutely  494 a glass basin fig 52 four inches in diameter and four inches deep had a division of mica a fixed across the upper part so as to descend one inch and a half below the edge and be perfectly watertight at the sides a plate of platina b three inches wide was put into the basin on one side of the division a and retained there by a glass block below so that any gas produced by it in a future stage of the experiment should not ascend beyond the mica and cause currents in the liquid on that side a strong solution of sulphate of magnesia was carefully poured without splashing into the basin until it rose a little above the lower edge of the mica division a great care being taken that the glass or mica on the unoccupied or c side of the division in the figure should not be moistened by agitation of the solution above the level to which it rose a thin piece of clean cork wellwetted in distilled water was then carefully and lightly placed on the solution at the c side and distilled water poured gently on to it until a stratum the eighth of an inch in thickness appeared over the sulphate of magnesia all was then left for a few minutes that any solution adhering to the cork might sink away from it or be removed by the water on which it now floated and then more distilled water was added in a similar manner until it reached nearly to the top of the glass in this way solution of the sulphate occupied the lower part of the glass and also the upper on the righthand side of the mica but on the lefthand side of the division a stratum of water from c to d one inch and a half in depth reposed upon it the two presenting when looked through horizontally a comparatively definite plane of contact a second platina pole e was arranged so as to be just under the surface of the water in a position nearly horizontal a little inclination being given to it that gas evolved during decomposition might escape the part immersed was three inches and a half long by one inch wide and about seveneighths of an inch of water intervened between it and the solution of sulphate of magnesia  495 the latter pole e was now connected with the negative end of a voltaic battery of forty pairs of plates four inches square whilst the former pole b was connected with the positive end there was action and gas evolved at both poles but from the intervention of the pure water the decomposition was very feeble compared to what the battery would have effected in a uniform solution after a little while less than a minute magnesia also appeared at the negative side it did not make its appearance at the negative metallic pole but in the water at the plane where the solution and the water met and on looking at it horizontally it could be there perceived lying in the water upon the solution not rising more than the fourth of an inch above the latter whilst the water between it and the negative pole was perfectly clear on continuing the action the bubbles of hydrogen rising upwards from the negative pole impressed a circulatory movement on the stratum of water upwards in the middle and downwards at the side which gradually gave an ascending form to the cloud of magnesia in the part just under the pole having an appearance as if it were there attracted to it but this was altogether an effect of the currents and did not occur until long after the phenomena looked for were satisfactorily ascertained  496 after a little while the voltaic communication was broken and the platina poles removed with as little agitation as possible from the water and solution for the purpose of examining the liquid adhering to them the pole c when touched by turmeric paper gave no traces of alkali nor could anything but pure water be found upon it the pole b though drawn through a much greater depth and quantity of fluid was found so acid as to give abundant evidence to litmus paper the tongue and other tests hence there had been no interference of alkaline salts in any way undergoing first decomposition and then causing the separation of the magnesia at a distance from the pole by mere chemical agencies this experiment was repeated again and again and always successfully  497 as therefore the substances evolved in cases of electrochemical decomposition may be made to appear against air 465 469which according to common language is not a conductor nor is decomposed or against water 495 which is a conductor and can be decomposedas well as against the metal poles which are excellent conductors but undecomposable there appears but little reason to consider the phenomena generally as due to the attraction or attractive powers of the latter when used in the ordinary way since similar attractions can hardly be imagined in the former instances  498 it may be said that the surfaces of air or of water in these cases become the poles and exert attractive powers but what proof is there of that except the fact that the matters evolved collect there which is the point to be explained and cannot be justly quoted as its own explanation or it may be said that any section of the humid conductor as that in the present case where the solution and the water meet may be considered as representing the pole but such does not appear to me to be the view of those who have written on the subject certainly not of some of them and is inconsistent with the supposed laws which they have assumed as governing the diminution of power at increased distances from the poles  499 grotthuss for instance describes the poles as centres of attractive and repulsive forces 481 these forces varying inversely as the squares of the distances and says therefore that a particle placed anywhere between the poles will be acted upon by a constant force but the compound force resulting from such a combination as he supposes would be anything but a constant force it would evidently be a force greatest at the poles and diminishing to the middle distance grotthuss is right however in the fact according to my experiments 502 505 that the particles are acted upon by equal force everywhere in the circuit when the conditions of the experiment are the simplest possible but the fact is against his theory and is also i think against all theories that place the decomposing effect in the attractive power of the poles  500 sir humphry davy who also speaks of the diminution of power with increase of distance from the polesa 483 supposes that when both poles are acting on substances to decompose them still the power of decomposition diminishes to the middle distance in this statement of fact he is opposed to grotthuss and quotes an experiment in which sulphate of potassa placed at different distances from the poles in a humid conductor of constant length decomposed when near the pole but not when at a distance such a consequence would necessarily result theoretically from considering the poles as centres of attraction and repulsion but i have not found the statement borne out by other experiments 505 and in the one quoted by him the effect was doubtless due to some of the many interfering causes of variation which attend such investigations    a philosophical transactions 1807 p 42  501 a glass vessel had a platina plate fixed perpendicularly across it so as to divide it into two cells a head of mica was fixed over it so as to collect the gas it might evolve during experiments then each cell and the space beneath the mica was filled with dilute sulphuric acid two poles were provided consisting each of a platina wire terminated by a plate of the same metal each was fixed into a tube passing through its upper end by an airtight joint that it might be moveable and yet that the gas evolved at it might be collected the tubes were filled with the acid and one immersed in each cell each platina pole was equal in surface to one side of the dividing plate in the middle glass vessel and the whole might be considered as an arrangement between the poles of the battery of a humid decomposable conductor divided in the middle by the interposed platina diaphragm it was easy when required to draw one of the poles further up the tube and then the platina diaphragm was no longer in the middle of the humid conductor but whether it were thus arranged at the middle or towards one side it always evolved a quantity of oxygen and hydrogen equal to that evolved by both the extreme platesa    a there are certain precautions in this and such experiments which   can only be understood and guarded against by a knowledge of the   phenomena to be described in the first part of the sixth series of   these researches  502 if the wires of a galvanometer be terminated by plates and these be immersed in dilute acid contained in a regularly formed rectangular glass trough connected at each end with a voltaic battery by poles equal to the section of the fluid a part of the electricity will pass through the instrument and cause a certain deflection and if the plates are always retained at the same distance from each other and from the sides of the trough are always parallel to each other and uniformly placed relative to the fluid then whether they are immersed near the middle of the decomposing solution or at one end still the instrument will indicate the same deflection and consequently the same electric influence  503 it is very evident that when the width of the decomposing conductor varies as is always the case when mere wires or plates as poles are dipped into or are surrounded by solution no constant expression can be given as to the action upon a single particle placed in the course of the current nor any conclusion of use relative to the supposed attractive or repulsive force of the poles be drawn the force will vary as the distance from the pole varies as the particle is directly between the poles or more or less on one side and even as it is nearer to or further from the sides of the containing vessels or as the shape of the vessel itself varies and in fact by making variations in the form of the arrangement the force upon any single particle may be made to increase or diminish or remain constant whilst the distance between the particle and the pole shall remain the same or the force may be made to increase or diminish or remain constant either as the distance increases or as it diminishes  504 from numerous experiments i am led to believe the following general expression to be correct but i purpose examining it much further and would therefore wish not to be considered at present as pledged to its accuracy the sum of chemical decomposition is constant for any section taken across a decomposing conductor uniform in its nature at whatever distance the poles may be from each other or from the section or however that section may intersect the currents whether directly across them or so oblique as to reach almost from pole to pole or whether it be plane or curved or irregular in the utmost degree provided the current of electricity be retained constant in quantity 377 and that the section passes through every part of the current through the decomposing conductor  505 i have reason to believe that the statement might be made still more general and expressed thus that for a constant quantity of electricity whatever the decomposing conductor may be whether water saline solutions acids fused bodies c the amount of electrochemical action is also a constant quantity ie would always be equivalent to a standard chemical effect founded upon ordinary chemical affinity i have this investigation in hand with several others and shall be prepared to give it in the next series but one of these researches  506 many other arguments might be adduced against the hypotheses of the attraction of the poles being the cause of electrochemical decomposition but i would rather pass on to the view i have thought more consistent with facts with this single remark that if decomposition by the voltaic battery depended upon the attraction of the poles or the parts about them being stronger than the mutual attraction of the particles separated it would follow that the weakest electrical attraction was stronger than if not the strongest yet very strong chemical attraction namely such as exists between oxygen and hydrogen potassium and oxygen chlorine and sodium acid and alkali c a consequence which although perhaps not impossible seems in the present state of the subject very unlikely  507 the view which m de la rive has taken 489 and also mm riffault and chompré 485 of the manner in which electrochemical decomposition is effected is very different to that already considered and is not affected by either the arguments or facts urged against the latter considering it as stated by the former philosopher it appears to me to be incompetent to account for the experiments of decomposition against surfaces of air 462 469 and water 495 which i have described for if the physical differences between metals and humid conductors which m de la rive supposes to account for the transmission of the compound of matter and electricity in the latter and the transmission of the electricity only with the rejection of the matter in the former be allowed for a moment still the analogy of air to metal is electrically considered so small that instead of the former replacing the latter 462 an effect the very reverse might have been expected or if even that were allowed the experiment with water 495 at once sets the matter at rest the decomposing pole being now of a substance which is admitted as competent to transmit the assumed compound of electricity and matter  508 with regard to the views of mm riffault and chompré 485 the occurrence of decomposition alone in the course of the current is so contrary to the wellknown effects obtained in the forms of experiment adopted up to this time that it must be proved before the hypothesis depending on it need be considered  509 the consideration of the various theories of electrochemical decomposition whilst it has made me diffident has also given me confidence to add another to the number for it is because the one i have to propose appears after the most attentive consideration to explain and agree with the immense collection of facts belonging to this branch of science and to remain uncontradicted by or unopposed to any of them that i have been encouraged to give it  510 electrochemical decomposition is well known to depend essentially upon the current of electricity i have shown that in certain cases 375 the decomposition is proportionate to the quantity of electricity passing whatever may be its intensity or its source and that the same is probably true for all cases 377 even when the utmost generality is taken on the one hand and great precision of expression on the other 505  511 in speaking of the current i find myself obliged to be still more particular than on a former occasion 283 in consequence of the variety of views taken by philosophers all agreeing in the effect of the current itself some philosophers with franklin assume but one electric fluid and such must agree together in the general uniformity and character of the electric current others assume two electric fluids and here singular differences have arisen  512 mm riffault and chompré for instance consider the positive and negative currents each as causing decomposition and state that the positive current is more powerful than the negative currenta the nitrate of soda being under similar circumstances decomposed by the former but not by the latter    a annales de chimie 1807 tom lxiii p 84  513 m hachette statesa that it is not necessary as has been believed that the action of the two electricities positive and negative should be simultaneous for the decomposition of water the passage implying if i have caught the meaning aright that one electricity can be obtained and can be applied in effecting decompositions independent of the other    a annales de chimie 1832 tom li p 73  514 the view of m de la rive to a certain extent agrees with that of m hachette for he considers that the two electricities decompose separate portions of water 490a in one passage he speaks of the two electricities as two influences wishing perhaps to avoid offering a decided opinion upon the independent existence of electric fluids but as these influences are considered as combining with the elements set free as by a species of chemical affinity and for the time entirely masking their character great vagueness of idea is thus introduced inasmuch as such a species of combination can only be conceived to take place between things having independent existences the two elementary electric currents moving in opposite directions from pole to pole constitute the ordinary voltaic current    a annales de chimie 1825 tom xxviii pp 197 201  515 m grotthuss is inclined to believe that the elements of water when about to separate at the poles combine with the electricities and so become gases m de la rives view is the exact reverse of this whilst passing through the fluid they are according to him compounds with the electricities when evolved at the poles they are deelectrified  516 i have sought amongst the various experiments quoted in support of these views or connected with electrochemical decompositions or electric currents for any which might be considered as sustaining the theory of two electricities rather than that of one but have not been able to perceive a single fact which could be brought forward for such a purpose or admitting the hypothesis of two electricities much less have i been able to perceive the slightest grounds for believing that one electricity in a current can be more powerful than the other or that it can be present without the other or that one can be varied or in the slightest degree affected without a corresponding variation in the othera if upon the supposition of two electricities a current of one can be obtained without the other or the current of one be exalted or diminished more than the other we might surely expect some variation either of the chemical or magnetical effects or of both but no such variations have been observed if a current be so directed that it may act chemically in one part of its course and magnetically in another the two actions are always found to take place together a current has not to my knowledge been produced which could act chemically and not magnetically nor any which can act on the magnet and not at the same time chemicallyb    a see now in relation to this subject 16271645dec 1838    b thermoelectric currents are of course no exception because when   they fail to act chemically they also fail to be currents  517 judging from facts only there is not as yet the slightest reason for considering the influence which is present in what we call the electric currentwhether in metals or fused bodies or humid conductors or even in air flame and rarefied elastic mediaas a compound or complicated influence it has never been resolved into simpler or elementary influences and may perhaps best be conceived of as an axis of power having contrary forces exactly equal in amount in contrary directions                                       518 passing to the consideration of electrochemical decomposition it appears to me that the effect is produced by an internal corpuscular action exerted according to the direction of the electric current and that it is due to a force either super to or giving direction to the ordinary chemical affinity of the bodies present the body under decomposition may be considered as a mass of acting particles all those which are included in the course of the electric current contributing to the final effect and it is because the ordinary chemical affinity is relieved weakened or partly neutralized by the influence of the electric current in one direction parallel to the course of the latter and strengthened or added to in the opposite direction that the combining particles have a tendency to pass in opposite courses  519 in this view the effect is considered as essentially dependent upon the mutual chemical affinity of the particles of opposite kinds particles aa fig 53 could not be transferred or travel from one pole n towards the other p unless they found particles of the opposite kind bb ready to pass in the contrary direction for it is by virtue of their increased affinity for those particles combined with their diminished affinity for such as are behind them in their course that they are urged forward and when any one particle a fig 54 arrives at the pole it is excluded or set free because the particle b of the opposite kind with which it was the moment before in combination has under the superinducing influence of the current a greater attraction for the particle a which is before it in its course than for the particle a towards which its affinity has been weakened  520 as far as regards any single compound particle the case may be considered as analogous to one of ordinary decomposition for in fig 54 a may be conceived to be expelled from the compound ab by the superior attraction of a for b that superior attraction belonging to it in consequence of the relative position of ab and a to the direction of the axis of electric power 517 superinduced by the current but as all the compound particles in the course of the current except those actually in contact with the poles act conjointly and consist of elementary particles which whilst they are in one direction expelling are in the other being expelled the case becomes more complicated but not more difficult of comprehension  521 it is not here assumed that the acting particles must be in a right line between the poles the lines of action which may be supposed to represent the electric currents passing through a decomposing liquid have in many experiments very irregular forms and even in the simplest case of two wires or points immersed as poles in a drop or larger single portion of fluid these lines must diverge rapidly from the poles and the direction in which the chemical affinity between particles is most powerfully modified 519 520 will vary with the direction of these lines according constantly with them but even in reference to these lines or currents it is not supposed that the particles which mutually affect each other must of necessity be parallel to them but only that they shall accord generally with their direction two particles placed in a line perpendicular to the electric current passing in any particular place are not supposed to have their ordinary chemical relations towards each other affected but as the line joining them is inclined one way to the current their mutual affinity is increased as it is inclined in the other direction it is diminished and the effect is a maximum when that line is parallel to the currenta    a in reference to this subject see now electrolytic induction and   discharge series xii ¶ viii 13431351 cdec 1838  522 that the actions of whatever kind they may be take place frequently in oblique directions is evident from the circumstance of those particles being included which in numerous cases are not in a line between the poles thus when wires are used as poles in a glass of solution the decompositions and recompositions occur to the right or left of the direct line between the poles and indeed in every part to which the currents extend as is proved by many experiments and must therefore often occur between particles obliquely placed as respects the current itself and when a metallic vessel containing the solution is made one pole whilst a mere point or wire is used for the other the decompositions and recompositions must frequently be still more oblique to the course of the currents  523 the theory which i have ventured to put forth almost requires an admission that in a compound body capable of electrochemical decomposition the elementary particles have a mutual relation to and influence upon each other extending beyond those with which they are immediately combined thus in water a particle of hydrogen in combination with oxygen is considered as not altogether indifferent to other particles of oxygen although they are combined with other particles of hydrogen but to have an affinity or attraction towards them which though it does not at all approach in force under ordinary circumstances to that by which it is combined with its own particle can under the electric influence exerted in a definite direction be made even to surpass it this general relation of particles already in combination to other particles with which they are not combined is sufficiently distinct in numerous results of a purely chemical character especially in those where partial decompositions only take place and in berthollets experiments on the effects of quantity upon affinity and it probably has a direct relation to and connexion with attraction of aggregation both in solids and fluids it is a remarkable circumstance that in gases and vapours where the attraction of aggregation ceases there likewise the decomposing powers of electricity apparently cease and there also the chemical action of quantity is no longer evident it seems not unlikely that the inability to suffer decomposition in these cases may be dependent upon the absence of that mutual attractive relation of the particles which is the cause of aggregation  524 i hope i have now distinctly stated although in general terms the view i entertain of the cause of electrochemical decomposition as far as that cause can at present be traced and understood i conceive the effects to arise from forces which are internal relative to the matter under decompositionand not external as they might be considered if directly dependent upon the poles i suppose that the effects are due to a modification by the electric current of the chemical affinity of the particles through or by which that current is passing giving them the power of acting more forcibly in one direction than in another and consequently making them travel by a series of successive decompositions and recompositions in opposite directions and finally causing their expulsion or exclusion at the boundaries of the body under decomposition in the direction of the current and that in larger or smaller quantities according as the current is more or less powerful 377 i think therefore it would be more philosophical and more directly expressive of the facts to speak of such a body in relation to the current passing through it rather than to the poles as they are usually called in contact with it and say that whilst under decomposition oxygen chlorine iodine acids c are rendered at its negative extremity and combustibles metals alkalies bases c at its positive extremity 467 i do not believe that a substance can be transferred in the electric current beyond the point where it ceases to find particles with which it can combine and i may refer to the experiments made in air 465 and in water 495 already quoted for facts illustrating these views in the first instance to which i will now add others  525 in order to show the dependence of the decomposition and transfer of elements upon the chemical affinity of the substances present experiments were made upon sulphuric acid in the following manner dilute sulphuric acid was prepared its specific gravity was 10212 a solution of sulphate of soda was also prepared of such strength that a measure of it contained exactly as much sulphuric acid as an equal measure of the diluted acid just referred to a solution of pure soda and another of pure ammonia were likewise prepared of such strengths that a measure of either should be exactly neutralized by a measure of the prepared sulphuric acid  526 four glass cups were then arranged as in fig 55 seventeen measures of the free sulphuric acid 525 were put into each of the vessels a and b and seventeen measures of the solution of sulphate of soda into each of the vessels a and b asbestus which had been wellwashed in acid acted upon by the voltaic pile wellwashed in water and dried by pressure was used to connect a with b and a with b the portions being as equal as they could be made in quantity and cut as short as was consistent with their performing the part of effectual communications b and a were connected by two platina plates or poles soldered to the extremities of one wire and the cups a and b were by similar platina plates connected with a voltaic battery of forty pairs of plates four inches square that in a being connected with the negative and that in b with the positive pole the battery which was not powerfully charged was retained in communication above half an hour in this manner it was certain that the same electric current had passed through a b and a b and that in each instance the same quantity and strength of acid had been submitted to its action but in one case merely dissolved in water and in the other dissolved and also combined with an alkali  527 on breaking the connexion with the battery the portions of asbestus were lifted out and the drops hanging at the ends allowed to fall each into its respective vessel the acids in a and b were then first compared for which purpose two evaporating dishes were balanced and the acid from a put into one and that from b into the other but as one was a little heavier than the other a small drop was transferred from the heavier to the lighter and the two rendered equal in weight being neutralized by the addition of the soda solution 525 that from a or the negative vessel required 15 parts of the soda solution and that from b or the positive vessel required 163 parts that the sum of these is not 34 parts is principally due to the acid removed with the asbestus but taking the mean of 1565 parts it would appear that a twentyfourth part of the acid originally in the vessel a had passed through the influence of the electric current from a into b  528 in comparing the difference of acid in a and b the necessary equality of weight was considered as of no consequence because the solution was at first neutral and would not therefore affect the test liquids and all the evolved acid would be in b and the free alkali in a the solution in a required 32 measures of the prepared acid 525 to neutralize it and the solution in b required also 32 measures of the soda solution 525 to neutralize it as the asbestus must have removed a little acid and alkali from the glasses these quantities are by so much too small and therefore it would appear that about a tenth of the acid originally in the vessel a had been transferred into b during the continuance of the electric action  529 in another similar experiment whilst a thirtyfifth part of the acid passed from a to b in the free acid vessels between a tenth and an eleventh passed from a to b in the combined acid vessels other experiments of the same kind gave similar results  530 the variation of electrochemical decomposition the transfer of elements and their accumulation at the poles according as the substance submitted to action consists of particles opposed more or less in their chemical affinity together with the consequent influence of the latter circumstances are sufficiently obvious in these cases where sulphuric acid is acted upon in the same quantity by the same electric current but in one case opposed to the comparatively weak affinity of water for it and in the other to the stronger one of soda in the latter case the quantity transferred is from two and a half to three times what it is in the former and it appears therefore very evident that the transfer is greatly dependent upon the mutual action of the particles of the decomposing bodiesa    a see the note to 675dec 1838  531 in some of the experiments the acid from the vessels a and b was neutralized by ammonia then evaporated to dryness heated to redness and the residue examined for sulphates in these cases more sulphate was always obtained from a than from b showing that it had been impossible to exclude saline bases derived from the asbestus the glass or perhaps impurities originally in the acid and that they had helped in transferring the acid into b but the quantity was small and the acid was principally transferred by relation to the water present  532 i endeavoured to arrange certain experiments by which saline solutions should be decomposed against surfaces of water and at first worked with the electric machine upon a piece of bibulous paper or asbestus moistened in the solution and in contact at its two extremities with pointed pieces of paper moistened in pure water which served to carry the electric current to and from the solution in the middle piece but i found numerous interfering difficulties thus the water and solutions in the pieces of paper could not be prevented from mingling at the point where they touched again sufficient acid could be derived from the paper connected with the discharging train or it may be even from the air itself under the influence of electric action to neutralize the alkali developed at the positive extremity of the decomposing solution and so not merely prevent its appearance but actually transfer it on to the metal termination and in fact when the paper points were not allowed to touch there and the machine was worked until alkali was evolved at the delivering or positive end of the turmeric paper containing the sulphate of soda solution it was merely necessary to place the opposite receiving point of the paper connected with the discharging train which had been moistened by distilled water upon the brown turmeric point and press them together when the alkaline effect immediately disappeared  533 the experiment with sulphate of magnesia already described 495 is a case in point however and shows most clearly that the sulphuric acid and magnesia contributed to each others transfer and final evolution exactly as the same acid and soda affected each other in the results just given 527 c and that so soon as the magnesia advanced beyond the reach of the acid and found no other substance with which it could combine it appeared in its proper character and was no longer able to continue its progress towards the negative pole                                       534 the theory i have ventured to put forth appears to me to explain all the prominent features of electrochemical decomposition in a satisfactory manner  535 in the first place it explains why in all ordinary cases the evolved substances appear only at the poles for the poles are the limiting surfaces of the decomposing substance and except at them every particle finds other particles having a contrary tendency with which it can combine  536 then it explains why in numerous cases the elements or evolved substances are not retained by the poles and this is no small difficulty in those theories which refer the decomposing effect directly to the attractive power of the poles if in accordance with the usual theory a piece of platina be supposed to have sufficient power to attract a particle of hydrogen from the particle of oxygen with which it was the instant before combined there seems no sufficient reason nor any fact except those to be explained which show why it should not according to analogy with all ordinary attractive forces as those of gravitation magnetism cohesion chemical affinity c retain that particle which it had just before taken from a distance and from previous combination yet it does not do so but allows it to escape freely nor does this depend upon its assuming the gaseous state for acids and alkalies c are left equally at liberty to diffuse themselves through the fluid surrounding the pole and show no particular tendency to combine with or adhere to the latter and though there are plenty of cases where combination with the pole does take place they do not at all explain the instances of noncombination and do not therefore in their particular action reveal the general principle of decomposition  537 but in the theory that i have just given the effect appears to be a natural consequence of the action the evolved substances are expelled from the decomposing mass 518 519 not drawn out by an attraction which ceases to act on one particle without any assignable reason while it continues to act on another of the same kind and whether the poles be metal water or air still the substances are evolved and are sometimes set free whilst at others they unite to the matter of the poles according to the chemical nature of the latter ie their chemical relation to those particles which are leaving the substance under operation  538 the theory accounts for the transfer of elements in a manner which seems to me at present to leave nothing unexplained and it was indeed the phenomena of transfer in the numerous cases of decomposition of bodies rendered fluid by heat 380 402 which in conjunction with the experiments in air led to its construction such cases as the former where binary compounds of easy decomposability are acted upon are perhaps the best to illustrate the theory  539 chloride of lead for instance fused in a bent tube 400 and decomposed by platina wires evolves lead passing to what is usually called the negative pole and chlorine which being evolved at the positive pole is in part set free and in part combines with the platina the chloride of platina formed being soluble in the chloride of lead is subject to decomposition and the platina itself is gradually transferred across the decomposing matter and found with the lead at the negative pole  540 iodide of lead evolves abundance of lead at the negative pole and abundance of iodine at the positive pole  541 chloride of silver furnishes a beautiful instance especially when decomposed by silver wire poles upon fusing a portion of it on a piece of glass and bringing the poles into contact with it there is abundance of silver evolved at the negative pole and an equal abundance absorbed at the positive pole for no chlorine is set free and by careful management the negative wire may be withdrawn from the fused globule as the silver is reduced there the latter serving as the continuation of the pole until a wire or thread of revived silver five or six inches in length is produced at the same time the silver at the positive pole is as rapidly dissolved by the chlorine which seizes upon it so that the wire has to be continually advanced as it is melted away the whole experiment includes the action of only two elements silver and chlorine and illustrates in a beautiful manner their progress in opposite directions parallel to the electric current which is for the time giving a uniform general direction to their mutual affinities 524  542 according to my theory an element or a substance not decomposable under the circumstances of the experiment as for instance a dilute acid or alkali should not be transferred or pass from pole to pole unless it be in chemical relation to some other element or substance tending to pass in the opposite direction for the effect is considered as essentially due to the mutual relation of such particles but the theories attributing the determination of the elements to the attractions and repulsions of the poles require no such condition ie there is no reason apparent why the attraction of the positive pole and the repulsion of the negative pole upon a particle of free acid placed in water between them should not with equal currents of electricity be as strong as if that particle were previously combined with alkali but on the contrary as they have not a powerful chemical affinity to overcome there is every reason to suppose they would be stronger and would sooner bring the acid to rest at the positive polea yet such is not the case as has been shown by the experiments on free and combined acid 526 528    a even sir humphry davy considered the attraction of the pole as   being communicated from one particle to another of the same kind   483  543 neither does m de la rives theory as i understand it require that the particles should be in combination it does not even admit where there are two sets of particles capable of combining with and passing by each other that they do combine but supposes that they travel as separate compounds of matter and electricity yet in fact the free substance cannot travel the combined one can  544 it is very difficult to find cases amongst solutions or fluids which shall illustrate this point because of the difficulty of finding two fluids which shall conduct shall not mingle and in which an element evolved from one shall not find a combinable element in the other solutions of acids or alkalies will not answer because they exist by virtue of an attraction and increasing the solubility of a body in one direction and diminishing it in the opposite is just as good a reason for transfer as modifying the affinity between the acids and alkalies themselvesa nevertheless the case of sulphate of magnesia is in point 494 495 and shows that one element or principle only has no power of transference or of passing towards either pole    a see the note to 670dec 1838  545 many of the metals however in their solid state offer very fair instances of the kind required thus if a plate of platina be used as the positive pole in a solution of sulphuric acid oxygen will pass towards it and so will acid but these are not substances having such chemical relation to the platina as even under the favourable condition superinduced by the current 518 524 to combine with it the platina therefore remains where it was first placed and has no tendency to pass towards the negative pole but if a plate of iron zinc or copper be substituted for the platina then the oxygen and acid can combine with these and the metal immediately begins to travel as an oxide to the opposite pole and is finally deposited there or if retaining the platina pole a fused chloride as of lead zinc silver c be substituted for the sulphuric acid then as the platina finds an element it can combine with it enters into union acts as other elements do in cases of voltaic decomposition is rapidly transferred across the melted matter and expelled at the negative pole  546 i can see but little reason in the theories referring the electrochemical decomposition to the attractions and repulsions of the poles and i can perceive none in m de la rives theory why the metal of the positive pole should not be transferred across the intervening conductor and deposited at the negative pole even when it cannot act chemically upon the element of the fluid surrounding it it cannot be referred to the attraction of cohesion preventing such an effect for if the pole be made of the lightest spongy platina the effect is the same or if gold precipitated by sulphate of iron be diffused through the solution still accumulation of it at the negative pole will not take place and yet the attraction of cohesion is almost perfectly overcome the particles are in it so small as to remain for hours in suspension and are perfectly free to move by the slightest impulse towards either pole and if in relation by chemical affinity to any substance present are powerfully determined to the negative polea    a in making this experiment care must be taken that no substance be   present that can act chemically on the gold although i used the metal   very carefully washed and diffused through dilute sulphuric acid yet   in the first instance i obtained gold at the negative pole and the   effect was repeated when the platina poles were changed but on   examining the clear liquor in the cell after subsidence of the   metallic gold i found a little of that metal in solution and a   little chlorine was also present i therefore well washed the gold   which had thus been subjected to voltaic action diffused it through   other pure dilute sulphuric acid and then found that on subjecting   it to the action of the pile not the slightest tendency to the   negative pole could be perceived  547 in support of these arguments it may be observed that as yet no determination of a substance to a pole or tendency to obey the electric current has been observed that i am aware of in cases of mere mixture ie a substance diffused through a fluid but having no sensible chemical affinity with it or with substances that may be evolved from it during the action does not in any case seem to be affected by the electric current pulverised charcoal was diffused through dilute sulphuric acid and subjected with the solution to the action of a voltaic battery terminated by platina poles but not the slightest tendency of the charcoal to the negative pole could be observed sublimed sulphur was diffused through similar acid and submitted to the same action a silver plate being used as the negative pole but the sulphur had no tendency to pass to that pole the silver was not tarnished nor did any sulphuretted hydrogen appear the case of magnesia and water 495 533 with those of comminuted metals in certain solutions 546 are also of this kind and in fact substances which have the instant before been powerfully determined towards the pole as magnesia from sulphate of magnesia become entirely indifferent to it the moment they assume their independent state and pass away diffusing themselves through the surrounding fluid  548 there are it is true many instances of insoluble bodies being acted upon as glass sulphate of baryta marble slate basalt c but they form no exception for the substances they give up are in direct and strong relation as to chemical affinity with those which they find in the surrounding solution so that these decompositions enter into the class of ordinary effects  549 it may be expressed as a general consequence that the more directly bodies are opposed to each other in chemical affinity the more ready is their separation from each other in cases of electrochemical decomposition ie provided other circumstances as insolubility deficient conducting power proportions c do not interfere this is well known to be the case with water and saline solutions and i have found it to be equally true with dry chlorides iodides salts c rendered subject to electrochemical decomposition by fusion 402 so that in applying the voltaic battery for the purpose of decomposing bodies not yet resolved into forms of matter simpler than their own it must be remembered that success may depend not upon the weakness or failure upon the strength of the affinity by which the elements sought for are held together but contrariwise and then modes of application may be devised by which in association with ordinary chemical powers and the assistance of fusion 394 417 we may be able to penetrate much further than at present into the constitution of our chemical elements  550 some of the most beautiful and surprising cases of electrochemical decomposition and transfer which sir humphry davy described in his celebrated papera were those in which acids were passed through alkalies and alkalies or earths through acidsb and the way in which substances having the most powerful attractions for each other were thus prevented from combining or as it is said had their natural affinity destroyed or suspended throughout the whole of the circuit excited the utmost astonishment but if i be right in the view i have taken of the effects it will appear that that which made the wonder is in fact the essential condition of transfer and decomposition and that the more alkali there is in the course of an acid the more will the transfer of that acid be facilitated from pole to pole and perhaps a better illustration of the difference between the theory i have ventured and those previously existing cannot be offered than the views they respectively give of such facts as these    a philosophical transactions 1807 p 1    b ibid p 24 c  551 the instances in which sulphuric acid could not be passed though baryta or baryta through sulphuric acida because of the precipitation of sulphate of baryta enter within the pale of the law already described 380 412 by which liquidity is so generally required for conduction and decomposition in assuming the solid state of sulphate of baryta these bodies became virtually nonconductors to electricity of so low a tension as that of the voltaic battery and the power of the latter over them was almost infinitely diminished    a philosophical transactions 1807 p 25 c  552 the theory i have advanced accords in a most satisfactory manner with the fact of an element or substance finding its place of rest or rather of evolution sometimes at one pole and sometimes at the other sulphur illustrates this effect very wella when sulphuric acid is decomposed by the pile sulphur is evolved at the negative pole but when sulphuret of silver is decomposed in a similar way 436 then the sulphur appears at the positive pole and if a hot platina pole be used so as to vaporize the sulphur evolved in the latter case then the relation of that pole to the sulphur is exactly the same as the relation of the same pole to oxygen upon its immersion in water in both cases the element evolved is liberated at the pole but not retained by it but by virtue of its elastic uncombinable and immiscible condition passes away into the surrounding medium the sulphur is evidently determined in these opposite directions by its opposite chemical relations to oxygen and silver and it is to such relations generally that i have referred all electrochemical phenomena where they do not exist no electrochemical action can take place where they are strongest it is most powerful where they are reversed the direction of transfer of the substance is reversed with them    a at 681 and 757 of series vii will be found corrections of the   statement here made respecting sulphur and sulphuric acid at present   there is no wellascertained fact which proves that the same body can   go directly to either of the two poles at pleasuredec 1838  553 water may be considered as one of those substances which can be made to pass to either pole when the poles are immersed in dilute sulphuric acid 527 acid passes towards the positive pole and water towards the negative pole but when they are immersed in dilute alkali the alkali passes towards the negative pole and water towards the positive pole  554 nitrogen is another substance which is considered as determinable to either pole but in consequence of the numerous compounds which it forms some of which pass to one pole and some to the other i have not always found it easy to determine the true circumstances of its appearance a pure strong solution of ammonia is so bad a conductor of electricity that it is scarcely more decomposable than pure water but if sulphate of ammonia be dissolved in it then decomposition takes place very well nitrogen almost pure and in some cases quite is evolved at the positive pole and hydrogen at the negative pole  555 on the other hand if a strong solution of nitrate of ammonia be decomposed oxygen appears at the positive pole and hydrogen with sometimes nitrogen at the negative pole if fused nitrate of ammonia be employed hydrogen appears at the negative pole mingled with a little nitrogen strong nitric acid yields plenty of oxygen at the positive pole but no gas only nitrous acid at the negative pole weak nitric acid yields the oxygen and hydrogen of the water present the acid apparently remaining unchanged strong nitric acid with nitrate of ammonia dissolved in it yields a gas at the negative pole of which the greater part is hydrogen but apparently a little nitrogen is present i believe that in some of these cases a little nitrogen appeared at the negative pole i suspect however that in all these and in all former cases the appearance of the nitrogen at the positive or negative pole is entirely a secondary effect and not an immediate consequence of the decomposing power of the electric currenta    a refer for proof of the truth of this supposition to 748 752   cdec 1838  556 a few observations on what are called the poles of the voltaic battery now seem necessary the poles are merely the surfaces or doors by which the electricity enters into or passes out of the substance suffering decomposition they limit the extent of that substance in the course of the electric current being its terminations in that direction hence the elements evolved pass so far and no further  557 metals make admirable poles in consequence of their high conducting power their immiscibility with the substances generally acted upon their solid form and the opportunity afforded of selecting such as are not chemically acted upon by ordinary substances  558 water makes a pole of difficult application except in a few cases 494 because of its small conducting power its miscibility with most of the substances acted upon and its general relation to them in respect to chemical affinity it consists of elements which in their electrical and chemical relations are directly and powerfully opposed yet combining to produce a body more neutral in its character than any other so that there are but few substances which do not come into relation by chemical affinity with water or one of its elements and therefore either the water or its elements are transferred and assist in transferring the infinite variety of bodies which in association with it can be placed in the course of the electric current hence the reason why it so rarely happens that the evolved substances rest at the first surface of the water and why it therefore does not exhibit the ordinary action of a pole  559 air however and some gases are free from the latter objection and may be used as poles in many cases 461 c but in consequence of the extremely low degree of conducting power belonging to them they cannot be employed with the voltaic apparatus this limits their use for the voltaic apparatus is the only one as yet discovered which supplies sufficient quantity of electricity 371 376 to effect electrochemical decomposition with facility  560 when the poles are liable to the chemical action of the substances evolved either simply in consequence of their natural relation to them or of that relation aided by the influence of the current 518 then they suffer corrosion and the parts dissolved are subject to transference in the same manner as the particles of the body originally under decomposition an immense series of phenomena of this kind might be quoted in support of the view i have taken of the cause of electrochemical decomposition and the transfer and evolution of the elements thus platina being made the positive and negative poles in a solution of sulphate of soda has no affinity or attraction for the oxygen hydrogen acid or alkali evolved and refuses to combine with or retain them zinc can combine with the oxygen and acid at the positive pole it does combine and immediately begins to travel as oxide towards the negative pole charcoal which cannot combine with the metals if made the negative pole in a metallic solution refuses to unite to the bodies which are ejected from the solution upon its surface but if made the positive pole in a dilute solution of sulphuric acid it is capable of combining with the oxygen evolved there and consequently unites with it producing both carbonic acid and carbonic oxide in abundance  561 a great advantage is frequently supplied by the opportunity afforded amongst the metals of selecting a substance for the pole which shall or shall not be acted upon by the elements to be evolved the consequent use of platina is notorious in the decomposition of sulphuret of silver and other sulphurets a positive silver pole is superior to a platina one because in the former case the sulphur evolved there combines with the silver and the decomposition of the original sulphuret is rendered evident whereas in the latter case it is dissipated and the assurance of its separation at the pole not easily obtained  562 the effects which take place when a succession of conducting decomposable and undecomposable substances are placed in the electric circuit as for instance of wires and solutions or of air and solutions 465 469 are explained in the simplest possible manner by the theoretical view i have given in consequence of the reaction of the constituents of each portion of decomposable matter affected as they are by the supervention of the electric current 524 portions of the proximate or ultimate elements proceed in the direction of the current as far as they find matter of a contrary kind capable of effecting their transfer and being equally affected by them and where they cease to find such matter they are evolved in their free state ie upon the surfaces of metal or air bounding the extent of decomposable matter in the direction of the current  563 having thus given my theory of the mode in which electrochemical decomposition is effected i will refrain for the present from entering upon the numerous general considerations which it suggests wishing first to submit it to the test of publication and discussion  royal institution june 1833     sixth series   § 12 on the power of metals and other solids to induce the combination of gaseous bodies  received november 30 1833read january 11 1834   564 the conclusion at which i have arrived in the present communication may seem to render the whole of it unfit to form part of a series of researches in electricity since remarkable as the phenomena are the power which produces them is not to be considered as of an electric origin otherwise than as all attraction of particles may have this subtile agent for their common cause but as the effects investigated arose out of electrical researches as they are directly connected with other effects which are of an electric nature and must of necessity be understood and guarded against in a very extensive series of electrochemical decompositions 707 i have felt myself fully justified in describing them in this place  565 believing that i had proved by experiments hereafter to be described 705 the constant and definite chemical action of a certain quantity of electricity whatever its intensity might be or however the circumstances of its transmission through either the body under decomposition or the more perfect conductors were varied i endeavoured upon that result to construct a new measuring instrument which from its use might be called at least provisionally a voltaelectrometer 739a    a or voltameterdec 1838  566 during the course of the experiments made to render the instrument efficient i was occasionally surprised at observing a deficiency of the gases resulting from the decompositions of water and at last an actual disappearance of portions which had been evolved collected and measured the circumstances of the disappearance were these a glass tube about twelve inches in length and 34ths of an inch in diameter had two platina poles fixed into its upper hermetically sealed extremity the poles where they passed through the glass were of wire but terminated below in plates which were soldered to the wires with gold plate v fig 56 the tube was filled with dilute sulphuric acid and inverted in a cup of the same fluid a voltaic battery was connected with the two wires and sufficient oxygen and hydrogen evolved to occupy 45ths of the tube or by the graduation 116 parts on separating the tube from the voltaic battery the volume of gas immediately began to diminish and in about five hours only 1312 parts remained and these ultimately disappeared  567 it was found by various experiments that this effect was not due to the escape or solution of the gas nor to recombination of the oxygen or hydrogen in consequence of any peculiar condition they might be supposed to possess under the circumstances but to be occasioned by the action of one or both of the poles within the tube upon the gas around them on disuniting the poles from the pile after they had acted upon dilute sulphuric acid and introducing them into separate tubes containing mixed oxygen and hydrogen it was found that the positive pole effected the union of the gases but the negative pole apparently not 588 it was ascertained also that no action of a sensible kind took place between the positive pole with oxygen or hydrogen alone  568 these experiments reduced the phenomena to the consequence of a power possessed by the platina after it had been the positive pole of a voltaic pile of causing the combination of oxygen and hydrogen at common or even at low temperatures this effect is as far as i am aware altogether new and was immediately followed out to ascertain whether it was really of an electric nature and how far it would interfere with the determination of the quantities evolved in the cases of electrochemical decomposition required in the fourteenth section of these researches  569 several platina plates were prepared fig 57 they were nearly half an inch wide and two inches and a half long some were 1200dth of an inch others not more than 1600dth whilst some were as much as 170th of an inch in thickness each had a piece of platina wire about seven inches long soldered to it by pure gold then a number of glass tubes were prepared they were about nine or ten inches in length 58ths of an inch in internal diameter were sealed hermetically at one extremity and were graduated into these tubes was put a mixture of two volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen at the water pneumatic trough and when one of the plates described had been connected with the positive or negative pole of the voltaic battery for a given time or had been otherwise prepared it was introduced through the water into the gas within the tube the whole set aside in a testglass fig 58 and left for a longer or shorter period that the action might be observed  570 the following result may be given as an illustration of the phenomenon to be investigated diluted sulphuric acid of the specific gravity 1336 was put into a glass jar in which was placed also a large platina plate connected with the negative end of a voltaic battery of forty pairs of fourinch plates with double coppers and moderately charged one of the plates above described 569 was then connected with the positive extremity and immersed in the same jar of acid for five minutes after which it was separated from the battery washed in distilled water and introduced through the water of the pneumatic trough into a tube containing the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen 569 the volume of gases immediately began to lessen the diminution proceeding more and more rapidly until about 34ths of the mixture had disappeared the upper end of the tube became quite warm the plate itself so hot that the water boiled as it rose over it and in less than a minute a cubical inch and a half of the gases were gone having been combined by the power of the platina and converted into water  571 this extraordinary influence acquired by the platina at the positive pole of the pile is exerted far more readily and effectively on oxygen and hydrogen than on any other mixture of gases that i have tried one volume of nitrous gas was mixed with a volume of hydrogen and introduced into a tube with a plate which had been made positive in the dilute sulphuric acid for four minutes 570 there was no sensible action in an hour being left for thirtysix hours there was a diminution of about oneeighth of the whole volume action had taken place but it had been very feeble  572 a mixture of two volumes of nitrous oxide with one volume of hydrogen was put with a plate similarly prepared into a tube 569 570 this also showed no action immediately but in thirtysix hours nearly a fourth of the whole had disappeared ie about half of a cubic inch by comparison with another tube containing the same mixture without a plate it appeared that a part of the diminution was due to solution and the other part to the power of the platina but the action had been very slow and feeble  573 a mixture of one volume olefiant gas and three volumes oxygen was not affected by such a platina plate even though left together for several days 640 641  574 a mixture of two volumes carbonic oxide and one volume oxygen was also unaffected by the prepared platina plate in several days 645 c  575 a mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen was used in several experiments with plates prepared in a similar manner 570 diminution of bulk soon took place but when after thirtysix hours the experiments were examined it was found that nearly all the chlorine had disappeared having been absorbed principally by the water and that the original volume of hydrogen remained unchanged no combination of the gases therefore had here taken place  576 reverting to the action of the prepared plates on mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen 570 i found that the power though gradually diminishing in all cases could still be retained for a period varying in its length with circumstances when tubes containing plates 569 were supplied with fresh portions of mixed oxygen and hydrogen as the previous portions were condensed the action was found to continue for above thirty hours and in some cases slow combination could be observed even after eighty hours but the continuance of the action greatly depended upon the purity of the gases used 638  577 some plates 569 were made positive for four minutes in dilute sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1336 they were rinsed in distilled water after which two were put into a small bottle and closed up whilst others were left exposed to the air the plates preserved in the limited portion of air were found to retain their power after eight days but those exposed to the atmosphere had lost their force almost entirely in twelve hours and in some situations where currents existed in a much shorter time  578 plates were made positive for five minutes in sulphuric acid specific gravity 1336 one of these was retained in similar acid for eight minutes after separation from the battery it then acted on mixed oxygen and hydrogen with apparently undiminished vigour others were left in similar acid for forty hours and some even for eight days after the electrization and then acted as well in combining oxygen and hydrogen gas as those which were used immediately after electrization  579 the effect of a solution of caustic potassa in preserving the platina plates was tried in a similar manner after being retained in such a solution for forty hours they acted exceedingly well on oxygen and hydrogen and one caused such rapid condensation of the gases that the plate became much heated and i expected the temperature would have risen to ignition  580 when similarly prepared plates 569 had been put into distilled water for forty hours and then introduced into mixed oxygen and hydrogen they were found to act but very slowly and feebly as compared with those which had been preserved in acid or alkali when however the quantity of water was but small the power was very little impaired after three or four days as the water had been retained in a wooden vessel portions of it were redistilled in glass and this was found to preserve prepared plates for a great length of time prepared plates were put into tubes with this water and closed up some of them taken out at the end of twentyfour days were found very active on mixed oxygen and hydrogen others which were left in the water for fiftythree days were still found to cause the combination of the gases the tubes had been closed only by corks  581 the act of combination always seemed to diminish or apparently exhaust the power of the platina plate it is true that in most if not all instances the combination of the gases at first insensible gradually increased in rapidity and sometimes reached to explosion but when the latter did not happen the rapidity of combination diminished and although fresh portions of gas were introduced into the tubes the combination went on more and more slowly and at last ceased altogether the first effect of an increase in the rapidity of combination depended in part upon the water flowing off from the platina plate and allowing a better contact with the gas and in part upon the heat evolved during the progress of the combination 630 but notwithstanding the effect of these causes diminution and at last cessation of the power always occurred it must not however be unnoticed that the purer the gases subjected to the action of the plate the longer was its combining power retained with the mixture evolved at the poles of the voltaic pile in pure dilute sulphuric acid it continued longest and with oxygen and hydrogen of perfect purity it probably would not be diminished at all  582 different modes of treatment applied to the platina plate after it had ceased to be the positive pole of the pile affected its power very curiously a plate which had been a positive pole in diluted sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1336 for four or five minutes if rinsed in water and put into mixed oxygen and hydrogen would act very well and condense perhaps one cubic inch and a half of gas in six or seven minutes but if that same plate instead of being merely rinsed had been left in distilled water for twelve or fifteen minutes or more it would rarely fail when put into the oxygen and hydrogen of becoming in the course of a minute or two ignited and would generally explode the gases occasionally the time occupied in bringing on the action extended to eight or nine minutes and sometimes even to forty minutes and yet ignition and explosion would result this effect is due to the removal of a portion of acid which otherwise adheres firmly to the plate a    a in proof that this is the case refer to 1038dec 1838  583 occasionally the platina plates 569 after being made the positive pole of the battery were washed wiped with filteringpaper or a cloth and washed and wiped again being then introduced into mixed oxygen and hydrogen they acted apparently as if they had been unaffected by the treatment sometimes the tubes containing the gas were opened in the air for an instant and the plates put in dry but no sensible difference in action was perceived except that it commenced sooner  584 the power of heat in altering the action of the prepared platina plates was also tried 595 plates which had been rendered positive in dilute sulphuric acid for four minutes were wellwashed in water and heated to redness in the flame of a spiritlamp after this they acted very well on mixed oxygen and hydrogen others which had been heated more powerfully by the blowpipe acted afterwards on the gases though not so powerfully as the former hence it appears that heat does not take away the power acquired by the platina at the positive pole of the pile the occasional diminution of force seemed always referable to other causes than the mere heat if for instance the plate had not been wellwashed from the acid or if the flame used was carbonaceous or was that of an alcohol lamp trimmed with spirit containing a little acid or having a wick on which salt or other extraneous matter had been placed then the power of the plate was quickly and greatly diminished 634 636  585 this remarkable property was conferred upon platina when it was made the positive pole in sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1336 or when it was considerably weaker or when stronger even up to the strength of oil of vitriol strong and dilute nitric acid dilute acetic acid solutions of tartaric citric and oxalic acids were used with equal success when muriatic acid was used the plates acquired the power of condensing the oxygen and hydrogen but in a much inferior degree  586 plates which were made positive in solution of caustic potassa did not show any sensible action upon the mixed oxygen and hydrogen other plates made positive in solutions of carbonates of potassa and soda exhibited the action but only in a feeble degree  587 when a neutral solution of sulphate of soda or of nitre or of chlorate of potassa or of phosphate of potassa or acetate of potassa or sulphate of copper was used the plates rendered positive in them for four minutes and then washed in water acted very readily and powerfully on the mixed oxygen and hydrogen  588 it became a very important point in reference to the cause of this action of the platina to determine whether the positive pole only could confer it 567 or whether notwithstanding the numerous contrary cases the negative pole might not have the power when such circumstances as could interfere with or prevent the action were avoided three plates were therefore rendered negative for four minutes in diluted sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1336 washed in distilled water and put into mixed oxygen and hydrogen all of them acted though not so strongly as they would have done if they had been rendered positive each combined about a cubical inch and a quarter of the gases in twentyfive minutes on every repetition of the experiment the same result was obtained and when the plates were retained in distilled water for ten or twelve minutes before being introduced into the gas 582 the action was very much quickened  589 but when there was any metallic or other substance present in the acid which could be precipitated on the negative plate then that plate ceased to act upon the mixed oxygen and hydrogen  590 these experiments led to the expectation that the power of causing oxygen and hydrogen to combine which could be conferred upon any piece of platina by making it the positive pole of a voltaic pile was not essentially dependent upon the action of the pile or upon any structure or arrangement of parts it might receive whilst in association with it but belonged to the platina at all times and was always effective when the surface was perfectly clean and though when made the positive pole of the pile in acids the circumstances might well be considered as those which would cleanse the surface of the platina in the most effectual manner it did not seem impossible that ordinary operations should produce the same result although in a less eminent degree  591 accordingly a platina plate 569 was cleaned by being rubbed with a cork a little water and some coalfire ashes upon a glass plate being washed it was put into mixed oxygen and hydrogen and was found to act at first slowly and then more rapidly in an hour a cubical inch and a half had disappeared  592 other plates were cleaned with ordinary sandpaper and water others with chalk and water others with emery and water others again with black oxide of manganese and water and others with a piece of charcoal and water all of these acted in tubes of oxygen and hydrogen causing combination of the gases the action was by no means so powerful as that produced by plates having been in communication with the battery but from one to two cubical inches of the gases disappeared in periods extending from twentyfive to eighty or ninety minutes  593 upon cleaning the plates with a cork ground emery and dilute sulphuric acid they were found to act still better in order to simplify the conditions the cork was dismissed and a piece of platina foil used instead still the effect took place then the acid was dismissed and a solution of potassa used but the effect occurred as before  594 these results are abundantly sufficient to show that the mere mechanical cleansing of the surface of the platina is sufficient to enable it to exert its combining power over oxygen and hydrogen at common temperatures  595 i now tried the effect of heat in conferring this property upon platina 584 plates which had no action on the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen were heated by the flame of a freshly trimmed spiritlamp urged by a mouth blowpipe and when cold were put into tubes of the mixed gases they acted slowly at first but after two or three hours condensed nearly all the gases  596 a plate of platina which was about one inch wide and two and threequarters in length and which had not been used in any of the preceding experiments was curved a little so as to enter a tube and left in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen for thirteen hours not the slightest action or combination of the gases occurred it was withdrawn at the pneumatic trough from the gas through the water heated redhot by the spiritlamp and blowpipe and then returned when cold into the same portion of gas in the course of a few minutes diminution of the gases could be observed and in fortyfive minutes about one cubical inch and a quarter had disappeared in many other experiments platina plates when heated were found to acquire the power of combining oxygen and hydrogen  597 but it happened not infrequently that plates after being heated showed no power of combining oxygen and hydrogen gases though left undisturbed in them for two hours sometimes also it would happen that a plate which having been heated to dull redness acted feebly upon being heated to whiteness ceased to act and at other times a plate which having been slightly heated did not act was rendered active by a more powerful ignition  598 though thus uncertain in its action and though often diminishing the power given to the plates at the positive pole of the pile 584 still it is evident that heat can render platina active which before was inert 595 the cause of its occasional failure appears to be due to the surface of the metal becoming soiled either from something previously adhering to it which is made to adhere more closely by the action of the heat or from matter communicated from the flame of the lamp or from the air itself it often happens that a polished plate of platina when heated by the spiritlamp and a blowpipe becomes dulled and clouded on its surface by something either formed or deposited there and this and much less than this is sufficient to prevent it from exhibiting the curious power now under consideration 634 636 platina also has been said to combine with carbon and it is not at all unlikely that in processes of heating where carbon or its compounds are present a film of such a compound may be thus formed and thus prevent the exhibition of the properties belonging to pure platinaa    a when heat does confer the property it is only by the destruction   or dissipation of organic or other matter which had previously soiled   the plate 632 633 634dec 1838  599 the action of alkalies and acids in giving platina this property was now experimentally examined platina plates 569 having no action on mixed oxygen and hydrogen being boiled in a solution of caustic potassa washed and then put into the gases were found occasionally to act pretty well but at other times to fail in the latter case i concluded that the impurity upon the surface of the platina was of a nature not to be removed by the mere solvent action of the alkali for when the plates were rubbed with a little emery and the same solution of alkali 592 they became active  600 the action of acids was far more constant and satisfactory a platina plate was boiled in dilute nitric acid being washed and put into mixed oxygen and hydrogen gases it acted well other plates were boiled in strong nitric acid for periods extending from half a minute to four minutes and then being washed in distilled water were found to act very well condensing one cubic inch and a half of gas in the space of eight or nine minutes and rendering the tube warm 570  601 strong sulphuric acid was very effectual in rendering the platina active a plate 569 was heated in it for a minute then washed and put into the mixed oxygen and hydrogen upon which it acted as well as if it had been made the positive pole of a voltaic pile 570  602 plates which after being heated or electrized in alkali or after other treatment were found inert immediately received power by being dipped for a minute or two or even only for an instant into hot oil of vitriol and then into water  603 when the plate was dipped into the oil of vitriol taken out and then heated so as to drive off the acid it did not act in consequence of the impurity left by the acid upon its surface  604 vegetable acids as acetic and tartaric sometimes rendered inert platina active at other times not this i believe depended upon the character of the matter previously soiling the plates and which may easily be supposed to be sometimes of such a nature as to be removed by these acids and at other times not weak sulphuric acid showed the same difference but strong sulphuric acid 601 never failed in its action  605 the most favourable treatment except that of making the plate a positive pole in strong acid was as follows the plate was held over a spiritlamp flame and when hot rubbed with a piece of potassa fusa caustic potash which melting covered the metal with a coat of very strong alkali and this was retained fused upon the surface for a second or twoa it was then put into water for four or five minutes to wash off the alkali shaken and immersed for about a minute in hot strong oil of vitriol from this it was removed into distilled water where it was allowed to remain ten or fifteen minutes to remove the last traces of acid 582 being then put into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen combination immediately began and proceeded rapidly the tube became warm the platina became redhot and the residue of the gases was inflamed this effect could be repeated at pleasure and thus the maximum phenomenon could be produced without the aid of the voltaic battery    a the heat need not be raised so much as to make the alkali tarnish   the platina although if that effect does take place it does not   prevent the ultimate action  606 when a solution of tartaric or acetic acid was substituted in this mode of preparation for the sulphuric acid still the plate was found to acquire the same power and would often produce explosion in the mixed gases but the strong sulphuric acid was most certain and powerful  607 if borax or a mixture of the carbonates of potash and soda be fused on the surface of a platina plate and that plate be wellwashed in water it will be found to have acquired the power of combining oxygen and hydrogen but only in a moderate degree but if after the fusion and washing it be dipped in the hot sulphuric acid 601 it will become very active  608 other metals than platina were then experimented with gold and palladium exhibited the power either when made the positive pole of the voltaic battery 570 or when acted on by hot oil of vitriol 601 when palladium is used the action of the battery or acid should be moderated as that metal is soon acted upon under such circumstances silver and copper could not be made to show any effect at common temperatures                                       609 there can remain no doubt that the property of inducing combination which can thus be conferred upon masses of platina and other metals by connecting them with the poles of the battery or by cleansing processes either of a mechanical or chemical nature is the same as that which was discovered by döbereinera in 1823 to belong in so eminent a degree to spongy platina and which was afterwards so well experimented upon and illustrated by mm dulong and thenardb in 1823 the latter philosophers even quote experiments in which a very fine platina wire which had been coiled up and digested in nitric sulphuric or muriatic acid became ignited when put into a jet of hydrogen gasc this effect i can now produce at pleasure with either wires or plates by the processes described 570 601 605 and by using a smaller plate cut so that it shall rest against the glass by a few points and yet allow the water to flow off fig 59 the loss of heat is less the metal is assimilated somewhat to the spongy state and the probability of failure almost entirely removed    a annales de chimie tom xxiv p 93    b ibid tom xxiii p 440 tom xxiv p 380    c ibid tom xxiv p 383  610 m döbereiner refers the effect entirely to an electric action he considers the platina and hydrogen as forming a voltaic element of the ordinary kind in which the hydrogen being very highly positive represents the zinc of the usual arrangement and like it therefore attracts oxygen and combines with ita    a tom xxiv pp 94 95 also bibliothèque universelle tom xxiv   p 54  611 in the two excellent experimental papers by mm dulong and thenarda those philosophers show that elevation of temperature favours the action but does not alter its character sir humphry davys incandescent platina wire being the same phenomenon with döbereiners spongy platina they show that all metals have this power in a greater or smaller degree and that it is even possessed by such bodies as charcoal pumice porcelain glass rock crystal c when their temperatures are raised and that another of davys effects in which oxygen and hydrogen had combined slowly together at a heat below ignition was really dependent upon the property of the heated glass which it has in common with the bodies named above they state that liquids do not show this effect at least that mercury at or below the boiling point has not the power that it is not due to porosity that the same body varies very much in its action according to its state and that many other gaseous mixtures besides oxygen and hydrogen are affected and made to act chemically when the temperature is raised they think it probable that spongy platina acquires its power from contact with the acid evolved during its reduction or from the heat itself to which it is then submitted    a annales de chimie tom xxiii p 440 tom xxiv p 380  612 mm dulong and thenard express themselves with great caution on the theory of this action but referring to the decomposing power of metals on ammonia when heated to temperatures not sufficient alone to affect the alkali they remark that those metals which in this case are most efficacious are the least so in causing the combination of oxygen and hydrogen whilst platina gold c which have least power of decomposing ammonia have most power of combining the elements of waterfrom which they are led to believe that amongst gases some tend to unite under the influence of metals whilst others tend to separate and that this property varies in opposite directions with the different metals at the close of their second paper they observe that the action is of a kind that cannot be connected with any known theory and though it is very remarkable that the effects are transient like those of most electrical actions yet they state that the greater number of the results observed by them are inexplicable by supposing them to be of a purely electric origin  613 dr fusinieri has also written on this subject and given a theory which he considers as sufficient to account for the phenomenaa he expresses the immediate cause thus the platina determines upon its surface a continual renovation of concrete laminæ of the combustible substance of the gases or vapours which flowing over it are burnt pass away and are renewed this combustion at the surface raises and sustains the temperature of the metal the combustible substance thus reduced into imperceptible laminæ of which the concrete parts are in contact with the oxygen is presumed to be in a state combinable with the oxygen at a much lower temperature than when it is in the gaseous state and more in analogy with what is called the nascent condition that combustible gases should lose their elastic state and become concrete assuming the form of exceedingly attenuated but solid strata is considered as proved by facts some of which are quoted in the giornale di fisica for 1824b and though the theory requires that they should assume this state at high temperatures and though the similar films of aqueous and other matter are dissipated by the action of heat still the facts are considered as justifying the conclusion against all opposition of reasoning    a giornale di fisica c 1825 tom viii p 259    b pp 138 371  614 the power or force which makes combustible gas or vapour abandon its elastic state in contact with a solid that it may cover the latter with a thin stratum of its own proper substance is considered as being neither attraction nor affinity it is able also to extend liquids and solids in concrete laminæ over the surface of the acting solid body and consists in a repulsion which is developed from the parts of the solid body by the simple fact of attenuation and is highest when the attenuation is most complete the force has a progressive development and acts most powerfully or at first in the direction in which the dimensions of the attenuated mass decrease and then in the direction of the angles or corners which from any cause may exist on the surface this force not only causes spontaneous diffusion of gases and other substances over the surface but is considered as very elementary in its nature and competent to account for all the phenomena of capillarity chemical affinity attraction of aggregation rarefaction ebullition volatilization explosion and other thermometric effects as well as inflammation detonation c c it is considered as a form of heat to which the term native calorie is given and is still further viewed as the principle of the two electricities and the two magnetisms  615 i have been the more anxious to give a correct abstract of dr fusinieris view both because i cannot form a distinct idea of the power to which he refers the phenomena and because of my imperfect knowledge of the language in which the memoir is written i would therefore beg to refer those who pursue the subject to the memoir itself  616 not feeling however that the problem has yet been solved i venture to give the view which seems to me sufficient upon known principles to account for the effect  617 it may be observed of this action that with regard to platina it cannot be due to any peculiar temporary condition either of an electric or of any other nature the activity of plates rendered either positive or negative by the pole or cleaned with such different substances as acids alkalies or water charcoal emery ashes or glass or merely heated is sufficient to negative such an opinion neither does it depend upon the spongy and porous or upon the compact and burnished or upon the massive or the attenuated state of the metal for in any of these states it may be rendered effective or its action may be taken away the only essential condition appears to be a perfectly clean and metallic surface for whenever that is present the platina acts whatever its form and condition in other respects may be and though variations in the latter points will very much affect the rapidity and therefore the visible appearances and secondary effects of the action ie the ignition of the metal and the inflammation of the gases they even in their most favourable state cannot produce any effect unless the condition of a clean pure metallic surface be also fulfilled  618 the effect is evidently produced by most if not all solid bodies weakly perhaps by many of them but rising to a high degree in platina dulong and thenard have very philosophically extended our knowledge of the property to its possession by all the metals and by earths glass stones c 611 and every idea of its being a known and recognised electric action is in this way removed  619 all the phenomena connected with this subject press upon my mind the conviction that the effects in question are entirely incidental and of a secondary nature that they are dependent upon the natural conditions of gaseous elasticity combined with the exertion of that attractive force possessed by many bodies especially those which are solid in an eminent degree and probably belonging to all by which they are drawn into association more or less close without at the same time undergoing chemical combination though often assuming the condition of adhesion and which occasionally leads under very favourable circumstances as in the present instance to the combination of bodies simultaneously subjected to this attraction i am prepared myself to admit and probably many others are of the same opinion both with respect to the attraction of aggregation and of chemical affinity that the sphere of action of particles extends beyond those other particles with which they are immediately and evidently in union 523 and in many cases produces effects rising into considerable importance and i think that this kind of attraction is a determining cause of döbereiners effect and of the many others of a similar nature  620 bodies which become wetted by fluids with which they do not combine chemically or in which they do not dissolve are simple and wellknown instances of this kind of attraction  621 all those cases of bodies which being insoluble in water and not combining with it are hygrometric and condense its vapour around or upon their surface are stronger instances of the same power and approach a little nearer to the cases under investigation if pulverized clay protoxide or peroxide of iron oxide of manganese charcoal or even metals as spongy platina or precipitated silver be put into an atmosphere containing vapour of water they soon become moist by virtue of an attraction which is able to condense the vapour upon although not to combine it with the substances and if as is well known these bodies so damped be put into a dry atmosphere as for instance one confined over sulphuric acid or if they be heated then they yield up this water again almost entirely it not being in direct or permanent combinationa    a i met at edinburgh with a case remarkable as to its extent of   hygrometric action assisted a little perhaps by very slight solvent   power some turf had been welldried by long exposure in a covered   place to the atmosphere but being then submitted to the action of a   hydrostatic press it yielded by the mere influence of the   pressure 54 per cent of water  622 still better instances of the power i refer to because they are more analogous to the cases to be explained are furnished by the attraction existing between glass and air so well known to barometer and thermometer makers for here the adhesion or attraction is exerted between a solid and gases bodies having very different physical conditions having no power of combination with each other and each retaining during the time of action its physical state unchangeda when mercury is poured into a barometer tube a film of air will remain between the metal and glass for months or as far as is known for years for it has never been displaced except by the action of means especially fitted for the purpose these consist in boiling the mercury or in other words of forming an abundance of vapour which coming in contact with every part of the glass and every portion of surface of the mercury gradually mingles with dilutes and carries off the air attracted by and adhering to those surfaces replacing it by other vapour subject to an equal or perhaps greater attraction but which when cooled condenses into the same liquid as that with which the tube is filled    a fusinieri and bellani consider the air as forming solid concrete   films in these casesgiornale di fisica tom viii p 262 1825  623 extraneous bodies which acting as nuclei in crystallizing or depositing solutions cause deposition of substances on them when it does not occur elsewhere in the liquid seem to produce their effects by a power of the same kind ie a power of attraction extending to neighbouring particles and causing them to become attached to the nuclei although it is not strong enough to make them combine chemically with their substance  624 it would appear from many cases of nuclei in solutions and from the effects of bodies put into atmospheres containing the vapours of water or camphor or iodine c as if this attraction were in part elective partaking in its characters both of the attraction of aggregation and chemical affinity nor is this inconsistent with but agreeable to the idea entertained that it is the power of particles acting not upon others with which they can immediately and intimately combine but upon such as are either more distantly situated with respect to them or which from previous condition physical constitution or feeble relation are unable to enter into decided union with them  625 then of all bodies the gases are those which might be expected to show some mutual action whilst jointly under the attractive influence of the platina or other solid acting substance liquids such as water alcohol c are in so dense and comparatively incompressible a state as to favour no expectation that their particles should approach much closer to each other by the attraction of the body to which they adhere and yet that attraction must according to its effects place their particles as near to those of the solid wetted body as they are to each other and in many cases it is evident that the former attraction is the stronger but gases and vapours are bodies competent to suffer very great changes in the relative distances of their particles by external agencies and where they are in immediate contact with the platina the approximation of the particles to those of the metal may be very great in the case of the hygrometric bodies referred to 621 it is sufficient to reduce the vapour to the fluid state frequently from atmospheres so rare that without this influence it would be needful to compress them by mechanical force into a bulk not more than 110th or even 120th of their original volume before the vapours would become liquids  626 another most important consideration in relation to this action of bodies and which as far as i am aware has not hitherto been noticed is the condition of elasticity under which the gases are placed against the acting surface we have but very imperfect notions of the real and intimate conditions of the particles of a body existing in the solid the liquid and the gaseous state but when we speak of the gaseous state as being due to the mutual repulsions of the particles or of their atmospheres although we may err in imagining each particle to be a little nucleus to an atmosphere of heat or electricity or any other agent we are still not likely to be in error in considering the elasticity as dependent on mutuality of action now this mutual relation fails altogether on the side of the gaseous particles next to the platina and we might be led to expect à priori a deficiency of elastic force there to at least one half for if as dalton has shown the elastic force of the particles of one gas cannot act against the elastic force of the particles of another the two being as vacua to each other so is it far less likely that the particles of the platina can exert any influence on those of the gas against it such as would be exerted by gaseous particles of its own kind  627 but the diminution of power to onehalf on the side of the gaseous body towards the metal is only a slight result of what seems to me to flow as a necessary consequence of the known constitution of gases an atmosphere of one gas or vapour however dense or compressed is in effect as a vacuum to another thus if a little water were put into a vessel containing a dry gas as air of the pressure of one hundred atmospheres as much vapour of the water would rise as if it were in a perfect vacuum here the particles of watery vapour appear to have no difficulty in approaching within any distance of the particles of air being influenced solely by relation to particles of their own kind and if it be so with respect to a body having the same elastic powers as itself how much more surely must it be so with particles like those of the platina or other limiting body which at the same time that they have not these elastic powers are also unlike it in nature hence it would seem to result that the particles of hydrogen or any other gas or vapour which are next to the platina c must be in such contact with it as if they were in the liquid state and therefore almost infinitely closer to it than they are to each other even though the metal be supposed to exert no attractive influence over them  628 a third and very important consideration in favour of the mutual action of gases under these circumstances is their perfect miscibility if fluid bodies capable of combining together are also capable of mixture they do combine when they are mingled not waiting for any other determining circumstance but if two such gases as oxygen and hydrogen are put together though they are elements having such powerful affinity as to unite naturally under a thousand different circumstances they do not combine by mere mixture still it is evident that from their perfect association the particles are in the most favourable state possible for combination upon the supervention of any determining cause such either as the negative action of the platina in suppressing or annihilating as it were their elasticity on its side or the positive action of the metal in condensing them against its surface by an attractive force or the influence of both together  629 although there are not many distinct cases of combination under the influence of forces external to the combining particles yet there are sufficient to remove any difficulty which might arise on that ground sir james hull found carbonic acid and lime to remain combined under pressure at temperatures at which they would not have remained combined if the pressure had been removed and i have had occasion to observe a case of direct combination in chlorinea which being compressed at common temperatures will combine with water and form a definite crystalline hydrate incapable either of being formed or of existing if that pressure be removed    a philosophical transactions 1823 p 161  630 the course of events when platina acts upon and combines oxygen and hydrogen may be stated according to these principles as follows from the influence of the circumstances mentioned 619 c ie the deficiency of elastic power and the attraction of the metal for the gases the latter when they are in association with the former are so far condensed as to be brought within the action of their mutual affinities at the existing temperature the deficiency of elastic power not merely subjecting them more closely to the attractive influence of the metal but also bringing them into a more favourable state for union by abstracting a part of that power upon which depends their elasticity which elsewhere in the mass of gases is opposing their combination the consequence of their combination is the production of the vapour of water and an elevation of temperature but as the attraction of the platina for the water formed is not greater than for the gases if so great for the metal is scarcely hygrometric the vapour is quickly diffused through the remaining gases fresh portions of this latter therefore come into juxtaposition with the metal combine and the fresh vapour formed is also diffused allowing new portions of gas to be acted upon in this way the process advances but is accelerated by the evolution of heat which is known by experiment to facilitate the combination in proportion to its intensity and the temperature is thus gradually exalted until ignition results  631 the dissipation of the vapour produced at the surface of the platina and the contact of fresh oxygen and hydrogen with the metal form no difficulty in this explication the platina is not considered as causing the combination of any particles with itself but only associating them closely around it and the compressed particles are as free to move from the platina being replaced by other particles as a portion of dense air upon the surface of the globe or at the bottom of a deep mine is free to move by the slightest impulse into the upper and rarer parts of the atmosphere  632 it can hardly be necessary to give any reasons why platina does not show this effect under ordinary circumstances it is then not sufficiently clean 617 and the gases are prevented from touching it and suffering that degree of effect which is needful to commence their combination at common temperatures and which they can only experience at its surface in fact the very power which causes the combination of oxygen and hydrogen is competent under the usual casual exposure of platina to condense extraneous matters upon its surface which soiling it take away for the time its power of combining oxygen and hydrogen by preventing their contact with it 598  633 clean platina by which i mean such as has been made the positive pole of a pile 570 or has been treated with acid 605 and has then been put into distilled water for twelve or fifteen minutes has a peculiar friction when one piece is rubbed against another it wets freely with pure water even after it has been shaken and dried by the heat of a spiritlamp and if made the pole of a voltaic pile in a dilute acid it evolves minute bubbles from every part of its surface but platina in its common state wants that peculiar friction it will not wet freely with water as the clean platina does and when made the positive pole of a pile it for a time gives off large bubbles which seem to cling or adhere to the metal and are evolved at distinct and separate points of the surface these appearances and effects as well as its want of power on oxygen and hydrogen are the consequences and the indications of a soiled surface  634 i found also that platina plates which had been cleaned perfectly soon became soiled by mere exposure to the air for after twentyfour hours they no longer moistened freely with water but the fluid ran up into portions leaving part of the surface bare whilst other plates which had been retained in water for the same time when they were dried 580 did moisten and gave the other indications of a clean surface  635 nor was this the case with platina or metals only but also with earthy bodies rock crystal and obsidian would not wet freely upon the surface but being moistened with strong oil of vitriol then washed and left in distilled water to remove all the acid they did freely become moistened whether they were previously dry or whether they were left wet but being dried and left exposed to the air for twentyfour hours their surface became so soiled that water would not then adhere freely to it but ran up into partial portions wiping with a cloth even the cleanest was still worse than exposure to air the surface either of the minerals or metals immediately became as if it were slightly greasy the floating upon water of small particles of metals under ordinary circumstances is a consequence of this kind of soiled surface the extreme difficulty of cleaning the surface of mercury when it has once been soiled or greased is due to the same cause  636 the same reasons explain why the power of the platina plates in some circumstances soon disappear and especially upon use mm dulong and thenard have observed the same effect with the spongy metala as indeed have all those who have used döbereiners instantaneous light machines if left in the air if put into ordinary distilled water if made to act upon ordinary oxygen and hydrogen they can still find in all these cases that minute portion of impurity which when once in contact with the surface of the platina is retained there and is sufficient to prevent its full action upon oxygen and hydrogen at common temperatures a slight elevation of temperature is again sufficient to compensate this effect and cause combination    a annales de chimie tom xxiv p 386  637 no state of a solid body can be conceived more favourable for the production of the effect than that which is possessed by platina obtained from the ammoniomuriate by heat its surface is most extensive and pure yet very accessible to the gases brought in contact with it if placed in impurity the interior as thenard and dulong have observed is preserved clean by the exterior and as regards temperature it is so bad a conductor of heat because of its divided condition that almost all which is evolved by the combination of the first portions of gas is retained within the mass exalting the tendency of the succeeding portions to combine                                       638 i have now to notice some very extraordinary interferences with this phenomenon dependent not upon the nature or condition of the metal or other acting solid but upon the presence of certain substances mingled with the gases acted upon and as i shall have occasion to speak frequently of a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen i wish it always to be understood that i mean a mixture composed of one volume of oxygen to two volumes of hydrogen being the proportions that form water unless otherwise expressed the hydrogen was always that obtained by the action of dilute sulphuric acid on pure zinc and the oxygen that obtained by the action of heat from the chlorate of potassa  639 mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen with air containing onefourth onehalf and even twothirds of the latter being introduced with prepared platina plates 570 605 into tubes were acted upon almost as well as if no air were present the retardation was far less than might have been expected from the mere dilution and consequent obstruction to the contact of the gases with the plates in two hours and a half nearly all the oxygen and hydrogen introduced as mixture was gone  640 but when similar experiments were made with olefiant gas the platina plates having been made the positive poles of a voltaic pile 570 in acid very different results occurred a mixture was made of 292 volumes hydrogen and 146 volumes oxygen being the proportions for water and to this was added another mixture of 3 volumes oxygen and one volume olefiant gas so that the olefiant gas formed but 140th part of the whole yet in this mixture the platina plate would not act in fortyfive hours the failure was not for want of any power in the plate for when after that time it was taken out of this mixture and put into one of oxygen and hydrogen it immediately acted and in seven minutes caused explosion of the gas this result was obtained several times and when larger proportions of olefiant gas were used the action seemed still more hopeless  641 a mixture of fortynine volumes oxygen and hydrogen 638 with one volume of olefiant gas had a wellprepared platina plate introduced the diminution of gas was scarcely sensible at the end of two hours during which it was watched but on examination twentyfour hours afterwards the tube was found blown to pieces the action therefore though it had been very much retarded had occurred at last and risen to a maximum  642 with a mixture of ninetynine volumes of oxygen and hydrogen 638 with one of olefiant gas a feeble action was evident at the end of fifty minutes it went on accelerating 630 until the eightyfifth minute and then became so intense that the gas exploded here also the retarding effect of the olefiant gas was very beautifully illustrated  643 plates prepared by alkali and acid 605 produced effects corresponding to those just described  644 it is perfectly clear from these experiments that olefiant gas even in small quantities has a very remarkable influence in preventing the combination of oxygen and hydrogen under these circumstances and yet without at all injuring or affecting the power of the platina  645 another striking illustration of similar interference may be shown in carbonic oxide especially if contrasted with carbonic acid a mixture of one volume oxygen and hydrogen 638 with four volumes of carbonic acid was affected at once by a platina plate prepared with acid c 605 and in one hour and a quarter nearly all the oxygen and hydrogen was gone mixtures containing less carbonic acid were still more readily affected  646 but when carbonic oxide was substituted for the carbonic acid not the slightest effect of combination was produced and when the carbonic oxide was only oneeighth of the whole volume no action occurred in forty and fifty hours yet the plates had not lost their power for being taken out and put into pure oxygen and hydrogen they acted well and at once  647 two volumes of carbonic oxide and one of oxygen were mingled with nine volumes of oxygen and hydrogen 638 this mixture was not affected by a plate which had been made positive in acid though it remained in it fifteen hours but when to the same volumes of carbonic oxide and oxygen were added thirtythree volumes of oxygen and hydrogen the carbonic oxide being then only 118th part of the whole the plate acted slowly at first and at the end of fortytwo minutes the gases exploded  648 these experiments were extended to various gases and vapours the general results of which may be given as follow oxygen hydrogen nitrogen and nitrous oxide when used to dilute the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen did not prevent the action of the plates even when they made fourfifths of the whole volume of gas acted upon nor was the retardation so great in any case as might have been expected from the mere dilution of the oxygen and hydrogen and the consequent mechanical obstruction to its contact with the platina the order in which carbonic acid and these substances seemed to stand was as follows the first interfering least with the action nitrous oxide hydrogen carbonic acid nitrogen oxygen but it is possible the plates were not equally well prepared in all the cases and that other circumstances also were unequal consequently more numerous experiments would be required to establish the order accurately  649 as to cases of retardation the powers of olefiant gas and carbonic oxide have been already described mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen containing from 116th to 120th of sulphuretted hydrogen or phosphuretted hydrogen seemed to show a little action at first but were not further affected by the prepared plates though in contact with them for seventy hours when the plates were removed they had lost all power over pure oxygen and hydrogen and the interference of these gases was therefore of a different nature from that of the two former having permanently affected the plate  650 a small piece of cork was dipped in sulphuret of carbon and passed up through water into a tube containing oxygen and hydrogen 638 so as to diffuse a portion of its vapour through the gases a plate being introduced appeared at first to act a little but after sixtyone hours the diminution was very small upon putting the same plate into a pure mixture of oxygen and hydrogen it acted at once and powerfully having apparently suffered no diminution of its force  651 a little vapour of ether being mixed with the oxygen and hydrogen retarded the action of the plate but did not prevent it altogether a little of the vapour of the condensed oilgas liquora retarded the action still more but not nearly so much as an equal volume of olefiant gas would have done in both these cases it was the original oxygen and hydrogen which combined together the ether and the oilgas vapour remaining unaffected and in both cases the plates retained the power of acting on fresh oxygen and hydrogen    a philosophical transactions 1825 p440  652 spongy platina was then used in place of the plates and jets of hydrogen mingled with the different gases thrown against it in air the results were exactly of the same kind although presented occasionally in a more imposing form thus mixtures of one volume of olefiant gas or carbonic oxide with three of hydrogen could not heat the spongy platina when the experiments were commenced at common temperatures but a mixture of equal volumes of nitrogen and hydrogen acted very well causing ignition with carbonic acid the results were still more striking a mixture of three volumes of that gas with one of hydrogen caused ignition of the platina yet that mixture would not continue to burn from the jet when attempts were made to light it by a taper a mixture even of seven volumes of carbonic acid and one of hydrogen will thus cause the ignition of cold spongy platina and yet as if to supply a contrast than which none can be greater it cannot burn at a taper but causes the extinction of the latter on the other hand the mixtures of carbonic oxide or olefiant gas which can do nothing with the platina are inflamed by the taper burning well  653 hydrogen mingled with the vapour of ether or oilgas liquor causes the ignition of the spongy platina the mixture with oilgas burns with a flame far brighter than that of the mixture of hydrogen and olefiant gas already referred to so that it would appear that the retarding action of the hydrocarbons is not at all in proportion merely to the quantity of carbon present  654 in connexion with these interferences i must state that hydrogen itself prepared from steam passed over ignited iron was found when mingled with oxygen to resist the action of platina it had stood over water seven days and had lost all fetid smell but a jet of it would not cause the ignition of spongy platina commencing at common temperatures nor would it combine with oxygen in a tube either under the influence of a prepared plate or of spongy platina a mixture of one volume of this gas with three of pure hydrogen and the due proportion of oxygen was not affected by plates after fifty hours i am inclined to refer the effect to carbonic oxide present in the gas but have not had time to verify the suspicion the power of the plates was not destroyed 640 646  655 such are the general facts of these remarkable interferences whether the effect produced by such small quantities of certain gases depends upon any direct action which they may exert upon the particles of oxygen and hydrogen by which the latter are rendered less inclined to combine or whether it depends upon their modifying the action of the plate temporarily for they produce no real change on it by investing it through the agency of a stronger attraction than that of the hydrogen or otherwise remains to be decided by more extended experiments                                       656 the theory of action which i have given for the original phenomena appears to me quite sufficient to account for all the effects by reference to known properties and dispenses with the assumption of any new power of matter i have pursued this subject at some length as one of great consequence because i am convinced that the superficial actions of matter whether between two bodies or of one piece of the same body and the actions of particles not directly or strongly in combination are becoming daily more and more important to our theories of chemical as well as mechanical philosophya in all ordinary cases of combustion it is evident that an action of the kind considered occurring upon the surface of the carbon in the fire and also in the bright part of a flame must have great influence over the combinations there taking place    a as a curious illustration of the influence of mechanical forces   over chemical affinity i will quote the refusal of certain substances   to effloresce when their surfaces are perfect which yield immediately   upon the surface being broken if crystals of carbonate of soda or   phosphate of soda or sulphate of soda having no part of their   surfaces broken be preserved from external violence they will not   effloresce i have thus retained crystals of carbonate of soda   perfectly transparent and unchanged from september 1827 to january   1833 and crystals of sulphate of soda from may 1832 to the present   time november 1833 if any part of the surface were scratched or   broken then efflorescence began at that part and covered the whole   the crystals were merely placed in evaporating basins and covered with   paper  657 the condition of elasticity upon the exterior of the gaseous or vaporous mass already referred to 626 627 must be connected directly with the action of solid bodies as nuclei on vapours causing condensation upon them in preference to any condensation in the vapours themselves and in the wellknown effect of nuclei on solutions a similar condition may have existence 623 for an analogy in condition exists between the parts of a body in solution and those of a body in the vaporous or gaseous state this thought leads us to the consideration of what are the respective conditions at the surfaces of contact of two portions of the same substance at the same temperature one in the solid or liquid and the other in the vaporous state as for instance steam and water it would seem that the particles of vapour next to the particles of liquid are in a different relation to the latter to what they would be with respect to any other liquid or solid substance as for instance mercury or platina if they were made to replace the water ie if the view of independent action which i have taken 626 627 as a consequence of daltons principles be correct it would also seem that the mutual relation of similar particles and the indifference of dissimilar particles which dalton has established as a matter of fact amongst gases and vapours extends to a certain degree amongst solids and fluids that is when they are in relation by contact with vapours either of their own substance or of other bodies but though i view these points as of great importance with respect to the relations existing between different substances and their physical constitution in the solid liquid or gaseous state i have not sufficiently considered them to venture any strong opinions or statements herea    a in reference to this paragraph and also 626 see a correction by   dr c henry in his valuable paper on this curious subject   philosophical magazine 1835 vol vi p 305dec 1838  658 there are numerous wellknown cases in which substances such as oxygen and hydrogen act readily in their nascent state and produce chemical changes which they are not able to effect if once they have assumed the gaseous condition such instances are very common at the poles of the voltaic pile and are i think easily accounted for if it be considered that at the moment of separation of any such particle it is entirely surrounded by other particles of a different kind with which it is in close contact and has not yet assumed those relations and conditions which it has in its fully developed state and which it can only assume by association with other particles of its own kind for at the moment its elasticity is absent and it is in the same relation to particles with which it is in contact and for which it has an affinity as the particles of oxygen and hydrogen are to each other on the surface of clean platina 626 627  659 the singular effects of retardation produced by very small quantities of some gases and not by large quantities of others 640 645 652 if dependent upon any relation of the added gas to the surface of the solid will then probably be found immediately connected with the curious phenomena which are presented by different gases when passing through narrow tubes at low pressures which i observed many years agoa and this action of surfaces must i think influence the highly interesting phenomena of the diffusion of gases at least in the form in which it has been experimented upon by mr graham in 1829 and 1831b and also by dr mitchell of philadelphiac in 1830 it seems very probable that if such a substance as spongy platina were used another law for the diffusion of gases under the circumstances would come out than that obtained by the use of plaster of paris    a quarterly journal of science 1819 vol vii p 106    b quarterly journal of science vol xxviii p 74 and edinburgh   transactions 1831    c journal of the royal institution for 1831 p 101  660 i intended to have followed this section by one on the secondary piles of ritter and the peculiar properties of the poles of the pile or of metals through which electricity has passed which have been observed by ritter van marum yelin de la rive marianini berzelius and others it appears to me that all these phenomena bear a satisfactory explanation on known principles connected with the investigation just terminated and do not require the assumption of any new state or new property but as the experiments advanced especially those of marianini require very careful repetition and examination the necessity of pursuing the subject of electrochemical decomposition obliges me for a time to defer the researches to which i have just referred  royal institution november 30 1833     seventh series   § 11 on electrochemical decomposition continueda ¶ iv on some general conditions of electrodecomposition ¶ v on a new measurer of voltaelectricity ¶ vi on the primary or secondary character of bodies evolved in electrodecomposition ¶ vii on the definite nature and extent of electrochemical decompositions § 13 on the absolute quantity of electricity associated with the particles or atoms of matter    a refer to the note after 1047 series viiidec 1838  received january 9read january 23 february 6 and 13 1834  preliminary   661 the theory which i believe to be a true expression of the facts of electrochemical decomposition and which i have therefore detailed in a former series of these researches is so much at variance with those previously advanced that i find the greatest difficulty in stating results as i think correctly whilst limited to the use of terms which are current with a certain accepted meaning of this kind is the term pole with its prefixes of positive and negative and the attached ideas of attraction and repulsion the general phraseology is that the positive pole attracts oxygen acids c or more cautiously that it determines their evolution upon its surface and that the negative pole acts in an equal manner upon hydrogen combustibles metals and bases according to my view the determining force is not at the poles but within the body under decomposition and the oxygen and acids are rendered at the negative extremity of that body whilst hydrogen metals c are evolved at the positive extremity 518 524  662 to avoid therefore confusion and circumlocution and for the sake of greater precision of expression than i can otherwise obtain i have deliberately considered the subject with two friends and with their assistance and concurrence in framing them i purpose henceforward using certain other terms which i will now define the poles as they are usually called are only the doors or ways by which the electric current passes into and out of the decomposing body 556 and they of course when in contact with that body are the limits of its extent in the direction of the current the term has been generally applied to the metal surfaces in contact with the decomposing substance but whether philosophers generally would also apply it to the surfaces of air 465 471 and water 493 against which i have effected electrochemical decomposition is subject to doubt in place of the term pole i propose using that of electrodea and i mean thereby that substance or rather surface whether of air water metal or any other body which bounds the extent of the decomposing matter in the direction of the electric current    a greek elektron and greek odos a way  663 the surfaces at which according to common phraseology the electric current enters and leaves a decomposing body are most important places of action and require to be distinguished apart from the poles with which they are mostly and the electrodes with which they are always in contact wishing for a natural standard of electric direction to which i might refer these expressive of their difference and at the same time free from all theory i have thought it might be found in the earth if the magnetism of the earth be due to electric currents passing round it the latter must be in a constant direction which according to present usage of speech would be from east to west or which will strengthen this help to the memory that in which the sun appears to move if in any case of electrodecomposition we consider the decomposing body as placed so that the current passing through it shall be in the same direction and parallel to that supposed to exist in the earth then the surfaces at which the electricity is passing into and out of the substance would have an invariable reference and exhibit constantly the same relations of powers upon this notion we purpose calling that towards the east the anodea and that towards the west the cathodeb and whatever changes may take place in our views of the nature of electricity and electrical action as they must affect the natural standard referred to in the same direction and to an equal amount with any decomposing substances to which these terms may at any time be applied there seems no reason to expect that they will lead to confusion or tend in any way to support false views the anode is therefore that surface at which the electric current according to our present expression enters it is the negative extremity of the decomposing body is where oxygen chlorine acids c are evolved and is against or opposite the positive electrode the cathode is that surface at which the current leaves the decomposing body and is its positive extremity the combustible bodies metals alkalies and bases are evolved there and it is in contact with the negative electrode    a greek ano upwards and greek odos a way the way which the sun rises    b greek kata downwards and greek odos a way the way   which the sun sets  664 i shall have occasion in these researches also to class bodies together according to certain relations derived from their electrical actions 822 and wishing to express those relations without at the same time involving the expression of any hypothetical views i intend using the following names and terms many bodies are decomposed directly by the electric current their elements being set free these i propose to call electrolytesa water therefore is an electrolyte the bodies which like nitric or sulphuric acids are decomposed in a secondary manner 752 757 are not included under this term then for electrochemically decomposed i shall often use the term electrolyzed derived in the same way and implying that the body spoken of is separated into its components under the influence of electricity it is analogous in its sense and sound to analyse which is derived in a similar manner the term electrolytical will be understood at once muriatic acid is electrolytical boracic acid is not    a greek elektron and greek lyo soluo n electrolyte v   electrolyze  665 finally i require a term to express those bodies which can pass to the electrodes or as they are usually called the poles substances are frequently spoken of as being electronegative or electropositive according as they go under the supposed influence of a direct attraction to the positive or negative pole but these terms are much too significant for the use to which i should have to put them for though the meanings are perhaps right they are only hypothetical and may be wrong and then through a very imperceptible but still very dangerous because continual influence they do great injury to science by contracting and limiting the habitual views of those engaged in pursuing it i propose to distinguish such bodies by calling those anionsa which go to the anode of the decomposing body and those passing to the cathode cationsb and when i have occasion to speak of these together i shall call them ions thus the chloride of lead is an electrolyte and when electrolyzed evolves the two ions chlorine and lead the former being an anion and the latter a cation    a greek aniôn that which goes up neuter participle    b greek katiôn that which goes down  666 these terms being once welldefined will i hope in their use enable me to avoid much periphrasis and ambiguity of expression i do not mean to press them into service more frequently than will be required for i am fully aware that names are one thing and science another  667 it will be well understood that i am giving no opinion respecting the nature of the electric current now beyond what i have done on former occasions 283 517 and that though i speak of the current as proceeding from the parts which are positive to those which are negative 663 it is merely in accordance with the conventional though in some degree tacit agreement entered into by scientific men that they may have a constant certain and definite means of referring to the direction of the forces of that current    since this paper was read i have changed some of the terms which were first proposed that i might employ only such as were at the same time simple in their nature clear in their reference and free from hypothesis   ¶ iv on some general conditions of electrochemical decomposition  669 from the period when electrochemical decomposition was first effected to the present time it has been a remark that those elements which in the ordinary phenomena of chemical affinity were the most directly opposed to each other and combined with the greatest attractive force were those which were the most readily evolved at the opposite extremities of the decomposing bodies 549  670 if this result was evident when water was supposed to be essential to and was present in almost every case of such decomposition 472 it is far more evident now that it has been shown and proved that water is not necessarily concerned in the phenomena 474 and that other bodies much surpass it in some of the effects supposed to be peculiar to that substance  671 water from its constitution and the nature of its elements and from its frequent presence in cases of electrolytic action has hitherto stood foremost in this respect though a compound formed by very powerful affinity it yields up its elements under the influence of a very feeble electric current and it is doubtful whether a case of electrolyzation can occur where being present it is not resolved into its first principles  672 the various oxides chlorides iodides and salts which i have shown are decomposable by the electric current when in the liquid state under the same general law with water 402 illustrate in an equally striking manner the activity in such decompositions of elements directly and powerfully opposed to each other by their chemical relations  673 on the other hand bodies dependent on weak affinities very rarely give way take for instance glasses many of those formed of silica lime alkali and oxide of lead may be considered as little more than solutions of substances one in anothera if bottleglass be fused and subjected to the voltaic pile it does not appear to be at all decomposed 408 if flint glass which contains substances more directly opposed be operated upon it suffers some decomposition and if borate of lead glass which is a definite chemical compound be experimented with it readily yields up its elements 408    a philosophical transactions 1830 p 49  674 but the result which is found to be so striking in the instances quoted is not at all borne out by reference to other cases where a similar consequence might have been expected it may be said that my own theory of electrochemical decomposition would lead to the expectation that all compound bodies should give way under the influence of the electric current with a facility proportionate to the strength of the affinity by which their elements either proximate or ultimate are combined i am not sure that that follows as a consequence of the theory but if the objection is supposed to be one presented by the facts i have no doubt it will be removed when we obtain a more intimate acquaintance with and precise idea of the nature of chemical affinity and the mode of action of an electric current over it 518 524 besides which it is just as directly opposed to any other theory of electrochemical decomposition as the one i have propounded for if it be admitted as is generally the case that the more directly bodies are opposed to each other in their attractive forces the more powerfully do they combine then the objection applies with equal force to any of the theories of electrolyzation which have been considered and is an addition to those which i have taken against them  675 amongst powerful compounds which are not decomposed boracic acids stand prominent 408 then again the iodide of sulphur and the chlorides of sulphur phosphorus and carbon are not decomposable under common circumstances though their elements are of a nature which would lead to a contrary expectation chloride of antimony 402 690 the hydrocarbons acetic acid ammonia and many other bodies undecomposable by the voltaic pile would seem to be formed by an affinity sufficiently strong to indicate that the elements were so far contrasted in their nature as to sanction the expectation that the pile would separate them especially as in some cases of mere solution 530 544 where the affinity must by comparison be very weak separation takes placea    a with regard to solution i have met with some reasons for   supposing that it will probably disappear as a cause of transference   and intend resuming the consideration at a convenient opportunity  676 it must not be forgotten however that much of this difficulty and perhaps the whole may depend upon the absence of conducting power which preventing the transmission of the current prevents of course the effects due to it all known compounds being nonconductors when solid but conductors when liquid are decomposed with perhaps the single exception at present known of periodide of mercury 679 691a and even water itself which so easily yields up its elements when the current passes if rendered quite pure scarcely suffers change because it then becomes a very bad conductor    a see now 1340 1341dec 1838  677 if it should hereafter be proved that the want of decomposition in those cases where from chemical considerations it might be so strongly expected 669 672 674 is due to the absence or deficiency of conducting power it would also at the same time be proved that decomposition depends upon conduction and not the latter upon the former 413 and in water this seems to be very nearly decided on the other hand the conclusion is almost irresistible that in electrolytes the power of transmitting the electricity across the substance is dependent upon their capability of suffering decomposition taking place only whilst they are decomposing and being proportionate to the quantity of elements separated 821 i may not however stop to discuss this point experimentally at present  678 when a compound contains such elements as are known to pass towards the opposite extremities of the voltaic pile still the proportions in which they are present appear to be intimately connected with capability in the compound of suffering or resisting decomposition thus the protochloride of tin readily conducts and is decomposed 402 but the perchloride neither conducts nor is decomposed 406 the protiodide of tin is decomposed when fluid 402 the periodide is not 405 the periodide of mercury when fused is not decomposed 691 even though it does conduct i was unable to contrast it with the protiodide the latter being converted into mercury and periodide by heat  679 these important differences induced me to look more closely to certain binary compounds with a view of ascertaining whether a law regulating the decomposability according to some relation of the proportionals or equivalents of the elements could be discovered the proto compounds only amongst those just referred to were decomposable and on referring to the substances quoted to illustrate the force and generality of the law of conduction and decomposition which i discovered 402 it will be found that all the oxides chlorides and iodides subject to it except the chloride of antimony and the periodide of mercury to which may now perhaps be added corrosive sublimate are also decomposable whilst many per compounds of the same elements not subject to the law were not so 405 406  680 the substances which appeared to form the strongest exceptions to this general result were such bodies as the sulphuric phosphoric nitric arsenic and other acids  681 on experimenting with sulphuric acid i found no reason to believe that it was by itself a conductor of or decomposable by electricity although i had previously been of that opinion 552 when very strong it is a much worse conductor than if diluteda if then subjected to the action of a powerful battery oxygen appears at the anode or positive electrode although much is absorbed 728 and hydrogen and sulphur appear at the cathode or negative electrode now the hydrogen has with me always been pure not sulphuretted and has been deficient in proportion to the sulphur present so that it is evident that when decomposition occurred water must have been decomposed i endeavoured to make the experiment with anhydrous sulphuric acid and it appeared to me that when fused such acid was not a conductor nor decomposed but i had not enough of the dry acid in my possession to allow me to decide the point satisfactorily my belief is that when sulphur appears during the action of the pile on sulphuric acid it is the result of a secondary action and that the acid itself is not electrolyzable 757    a de la rive  682 phosphoric acid is i believe also in the same condition but i have found it impossible to decide the point because of the difficulty of operating on fused anhydrous phosphoric acid phosphoric acid which has once obtained water cannot be deprived of it by heat alone when heated the hydrated acid volatilizes upon subjecting phosphoric acid fused upon the ring end of a wire 401 to the action of the voltaic apparatus it conducted and was decomposed but gas which i believe to be hydrogen was always evolved at the negative electrode and the wire was not affected as would have happened had phosphorus been separated gas was also evolved at the positive electrode from all the facts i conclude it was the water and not the acid which was decomposed  683 arsenic acid this substance conducted and was decomposed but it contained water and i was unable at the time to press the investigation so as to ascertain whether a fusible anhydrous arsenic acid could be obtained it forms therefore at present no exception to the general result  684 nitrous acid obtained by distilling nitrate of lead and keeping it in contact with strong sulphuric acid was found to conduct and decompose slowly but on examination there were strong reasons for believing that water was present and that the decomposition and conduction depended upon it i endeavoured to prepare a perfectly anhydrous portion but could not spare the time required to procure an unexceptionable result  685 nitric acid is a substance which i believe is not decomposed directly by the electric current as i want the facts in illustration of the distinction existing between primary and secondary decomposition i will merely refer to them in this place 752  686 that these mineral acids should confer facility of conduction and decomposition on water is no proof that they are competent to favour and suffer these actions in themselves boracic acid does the same thing though not decomposable m de la rive has pointed out that chlorine has this power also but being to us an elementary substance it cannot be due to its capability of suffering decomposition  687 chloride of sulphur does not conduct nor is it decomposed it consists of single proportionals of its elements but is not on that account an exception to the rule 679 which does not affirm that all compounds of single proportionals of elements are decomposable but that such as are decomposable are so constituted  688 protochloride of phosphorus does not conduct nor become decomposed  689 protochloride of carbon does not conduct nor suffer decomposition in association with this substance i submitted the hydrochloride of carbon from olefiant gas and chlorine to the action of the electric current but it also refused to conduct or yield up its elements  600 with regard to the exceptions 679 upon closer examination some of them disappear chloride of antimony a compound of one proportional of antimony and one and a half of chlorine of recent preparation was put into a tube fig 68 789 and submitted when fused to the action of the current the positive electrode being of plumbago no electricity passed and no appearance of decomposition was visible at first but when the positive and negative electrodes were brought very near each other in the chloride then a feeble action occurred and a feeble current passed the effect altogether was so small although quite amenable to the law before given 394 and so unlike the decomposition and conduction occurring in all the other cases that i attribute it to the presence of a minute quantity of water for which this and many other chlorides have strong attractions producing hydrated chlorides or perhaps of a true protochloride consisting of single proportionals 695 796  691 periodide of mercury being examined in the same manner was found most distinctly to insulate whilst solid but conduct when fluid according to the law of liquidoconduction 402 but there was no appearance of decomposition no iodine appeared at the anode nor mercury or other substance at the cathode the case is therefore no exception to the rule that only compounds of single proportionals are decomposable but it is an exception and i think the only one to the statement that all bodies subject to the law of liquidoconduction are decomposable i incline however to believe that a portion of protiodide of mercury is retained dissolved in the periodide and that to its slow decomposition the feeble conducting power is due periodide would be formed as a secondary result at the anode and the mercury at the cathode would also form as a secondary result protiodide both these bodies would mingle with the fluid mass and thus no final separation appear notwithstanding the continued decomposition  692 when perchloride of mercury was subjected to the voltaic current it did not conduct in the solid state but it did conduct when fluid i think also that in the latter case it was decomposed but there are many interfering circumstances which require examination before a positive conclusion can be drawna    a with regard to perchloride and periodide of mercury see now 1340   1341dec 1838  693 when the ordinary protoxide of antimony is subjected to the voltaic current in a fused state it also is decomposed although the effect from other causes soon ceases 402 801 this oxide consists of one proportional of antimony and one and a half of oxygen and is therefore an exception to the general law assumed but in working with this oxide and the chloride i observed facts which lead me to doubt whether the compounds usually called the protoxide and the protochloride do not often contain other compounds consisting of single proportions which are the true proto compounds and which in the case of the oxide might give rise to the decomposition above described  694 the ordinary sulphuret of antimony its considered as being the compound with the smallest quantity of sulphur and analogous in its proportions to the ordinary protoxide but i find that if it be fused with metallic antimony a new sulphuret is formed containing much more of the metal than the former and separating distinctly when fused both from the pure metal on the one hand and the ordinary gray sulphuret on the other in some rough experiments the metal thus taken up by the ordinary sulphuret of antimony was equal to half the proportion of that previously in the sulphuret in which case the new sulphuret would consist of single proportionals  695 when this new sulphuret was dissolved in muriatic acid although a little antimony separated yet it appeared to me that a true protochloride consisting of single proportionals was formed and from that by alkalies c a true protoxide consisting also of single proportionals was obtainable but i could not stop to ascertain this matter strictly by analysis  696 i believe however that there is such an oxide that it is often present in variable proportions in what is commonly called protoxide throwing uncertainty upon the results of its analysis and causing the electrolytic decomposition above describeda    a in relation to this and the three preceding paragraphs and also   801 see berzeliuss correction of the nature of the supposed now   sulphuret and oxide phil mag 1836 vol viii 476 and for the   probable explanation of the effects obtained with the protoxide refer   to 1340 1341dec 1838  697 upon the whole it appears probable that all those binary compounds of elementary bodies which are capable of being electrolyzed when fluid but not whilst solid according to the law of liquidoconduction 394 consist of single proportionals of their elementary principles and it may be because of their departure from this simplicity of composition that boracic acid ammonia perchlorides periodides and many other direct compounds of elements are indecomposable  698 with regard to salts and combinations of compound bodies the same simple relation does not appear to hold good i could not decide this by bisulphates of the alkalies for as long as the second proportion of acid remained water was retained with it the fused salts conducted and were decomposed but hydrogen always appeared at the negative electrode  699 a biphosphate of soda was prepared by heating and ultimately fusing the ammoniaphosphate of soda in this case the fused bisalt conducted and was decomposed but a little gas appeared at the negative electrode and though i believe the salt itself was electrolyzed i am not quite satisfied that water was entirely absent  700 then a biborate of soda was prepared and this i think is an unobjectionable case the salt when fused conducted and was decomposed and gas appeared at both electrodes even when the boracic acid was increased to three proportionals the same effect took place  701 hence this class of compound combinations does not seem to be subject to the same simple law as the former class of binary combinations whether we may find reason to consider them as mere solutions of the compound of single proportionals in the excess of acid is a matter which with some apparent exceptions occurring amongst the sulphurets must be left for decision by future examination  702 in any investigation of these points great care must be taken to exclude water for if present secondary effects are so frequently produced as often seemingly to indicate an electrodecomposition of substances when no true result of the kind has occurred 742 c  703 it is evident that all the cases in which decomposition does not occur may depend upon the want of conduction 677 413 but that does not at all lessen the interest excited by seeing the great difference of effect due to a change not in the nature of the elements but merely in their proportions especially in any attempt which may be made to elucidate and expound the beautiful theory put forth by sir humphry davya and illustrated by berzelius and other eminent philosophers that ordinary chemical affinity is a mere result of the electrical attractions of the particles of matter    a philosophical transactions 1807 pp 32 39 also 1826 pp 387   389   ¶ v on a new measure of voltaelectricity  704 i have already said when engaged in reducing common and voltaic electricity to one standard of measurement 377 and again when introducing my theory of electrochemical decomposition 504 505 510 that the chemical decomposing action of a current is constant for a constant quantity of electricity notwithstanding the greatest variations in its sources in its intensity in the size of the electrodes used in the nature of the conductors or nonconductors 307 through which it is passed or in other circumstances the conclusive proofs of the truth of these statements shall be given almost immediately 783 c  705 i endeavoured upon this law to construct an instrument which should measure out the electricity passing through it and which being interposed in the course of the current used in any particular experiment should serve at pleasure either as a comparative standard of effect or as a positive measurer of this subtile agent  706 there is no substance better fitted under ordinary circumstances to be the indicating body in such an instrument than water for it is decomposed with facility when rendered a better conductor by the addition of acids or salts its elements may in numerous cases be obtained and collected without any embarrassment from secondary action and being gaseous they are in the best physical condition for separation and measurement water therefore acidulated by sulphuric acid is the substance i shall generally refer to although it may become expedient in peculiar cases or forms of experiment to use other bodies 843  707 the first precaution needful in the construction of the instrument was to avoid the recombination of the evolved gases an effect which the positive electrode has been found so capable of producing 571 for this purpose various forms of decomposing apparatus were used the first consisted of straight tubes each containing a plate and wire of platina soldered together by gold and fixed hermetically in the glass at the closed extremity of the tube plate v fig 60 the tubes were about eight inches long 07 of an inch in diameter and graduated the platina plates were about an inch long as wide as the tubes would permit and adjusted as near to the mouths of the tubes as was consistent with the safe collection of the gases evolved in certain cases where it was required to evolve the elements upon as small a surface as possible the metallic extremity instead of being a plate consisted of the wire bent into the form of a ring fig 61 when these tubes were used as measurers they were filled with the dilute sulphuric acid inverted in a basin of the same liquid fig 62 and placed in an inclined position with their mouths near to each other that as little decomposing matter should intervene as possible and also in such a direction that the platina plates should be in vertical planes 720  708 another form of apparatus is that delineated fig 63 the tube is bent in the middle one end is closed in that end is fixed a wire and plate a proceeding so far downwards that when in the position figured it shall be as near to the angle as possible consistently with the collection at the closed extremity of the tube of all the gas evolved against it the plane of this plate is also perpendicular 720 the other metallic termination b is introduced at the time decomposition is to be effected being brought as near the angle as possible without causing any gas to pass from it towards the closed end of the instrument the gas evolved against it is allowed to escape  709 the third form of apparatus contains both electrodes in the same tube the transmission therefore of the electricity and the consequent decomposition is far more rapid than in the separate tubes the resulting gas is the sum of the portions evolved at the two electrodes and the instrument is better adapted than either of the former as a measurer of the quantity of voltaic electricity transmitted in ordinary cases it consists of a straight tube fig 64 closed at the upper extremity and graduated through the sides of which pass platina wires being fused into the glass which are connected with two plates within the tube is fitted by grinding into one mouth of a doublenecked bottle if the latter be onehalf or twothirds full of the dilute sulphuric acid 706 it will upon inclination of the whole flow into the tube and fill it when an electric current is passed through the instrument the gases evolved against the plates collect in the upper portion of the tube and are not subject to the recombining power of the platina  710 another form of the instrument is given at fig 65  711 a fifth form is delineated fig 66 this i have found exceedingly useful in experiments continued in succession for days together and where large quantities of indicating gas were to be collected it is fixed on a weighted foot and has the form of a small retort containing the two electrodes the neck is narrow and sufficiently long to deliver gas issuing from it into a jar placed in a small pneumatic trough the electrode chamber sealed hermetically at the part held in the stand is five inches in length and 06 of an inch in diameter the neck about nine inches in length and 04 of an inch in diameter internally the figure will fully indicate the construction  712 it can hardly be requisite to remark that in the arrangement of any of these forms of apparatus they and the wires connecting them with the substance which is collaterally subjected to the action of the same electric current should be so far insulated as to ensure a certainty that all the electricity which passes through the one shall also be transmitted through the other                                       713 next to the precaution of collecting the gases if mingled out of contact with the platinum was the necessity of testing the law of a definite electrolytic action upon water at least under all varieties of condition that with a conviction of its certainty might also be obtained a knowledge of those interfering circumstances which would require to be practically guarded against  714 the first point investigated was the influence or indifference of extensive variations in the size of the electrodes for which purpose instruments like those last described 709 710 711 were used one of these had plates 07 of an inch wide and nearly four inches long another had plates only 05 of an inch wide and 08 of an inch long a third had wires 002 of an inch in diameter and three inches long and a fourth similar wires only half an inch in length yet when these were filled with dilute sulphuric acid and being placed in succession had one common current of electricity passed through them very nearly the same quantity of gas was evolved in all the difference was sometimes in favour of one and sometimes on the side of another but the general result was that the largest quantity of gases was evolved at the smallest electrodes namely those consisting merely of platina wires  715 experiments of a similar kind were made with the singleplate straight tubes 707 and also with the curved tubes 708 with similar consequences and when these with the former tubes were arranged together in various ways the result as to the equality of action of large and small metallic surfaces when delivering and receiving the same current of electricity was constantly the same as an illustration the following numbers are given an instrument with two wires evolved 743 volumes of mixed gases another with plates 7325 volumes whilst the sum of the oxygen and hydrogen in two separate tubes amounted to 7365 volumes in another experiment the volumes were 553 553 and 544  716 but it was observed in these experiments that in singleplate tubes 707 more hydrogen was evolved at the negative electrode than was proportionate to the oxygen at the positive electrode and generally also more than was proportionate to the oxygen and hydrogen in a doubleplate tube upon more minutely examining these effects i was led to refer them and also the differences between wires and plates 714 to the solubility of the gases evolved especially at the positive electrode  717 when the positive and negative electrodes are equal in surface the bubbles which rise from them in dilute sulphuric acid are always different in character those from the positive plate are exceedingly small and separate instantly from every part of the surface of the metal in consequence of its perfect cleanliness 633 whilst in the liquid they give it a hazy appearance from their number and minuteness are easily carried down by currents and therefore not only present far greater surface of contact with the liquid than larger bubbles would do but are retained a much longer time in mixture with it but the bubbles at the negative surface though they constitute twice the volume of the gas at the positive electrode are nevertheless very inferior in number they do not rise so universally from every part of the surface but seem to be evolved at different parts and though so much larger they appear to cling to the metal separating with difficulty from it and when separated instantly rising to the top of the liquid if therefore oxygen and hydrogen had equal solubility in or powers of combining with water under similar circumstances still under the present conditions the oxygen would be far the most liable to solution but when to these is added its wellknown power of forming a compound with water it is no longer surprising that such a compound should be produced in small quantities at the positive electrode and indeed the blenching power which some philosophers have observed in a solution at this electrode when chlorine and similar bodies have been carefully excluded is probably due to the formation there in this manner of oxywater  718 that more gas was collected from the wires than from the plates i attribute to the circumstance that as equal quantities were evolved in equal times the bubbles at the wires having been more rapidly produced in relation to any part of the surface must have been much larger have been therefore in contact with the fluid by a much smaller surface and for a much shorter time than those at the plates hence less solution and a greater amount collected  719 there was also another effect produced especially by the use of large electrodes which was both a consequence and a proof of the solution of part of the gas evolved there the collected gas when examined was found to contain small portions of nitrogen this i attribute to the presence of air dissolved in the acid used for decomposition it is a wellknown fact that when bubbles of a gas but slightly soluble in water or solutions pass through them the portion of this gas which is dissolved displaces a portion of that previously in union with the liquid and so in the decompositions under consideration as the oxygen dissolves it displaces a part of the air or at least of the nitrogen previously united to the acid and this effect takes place most extensively with large plates because the gas evolved at them is in the most favourable condition for solution  720 with the intention of avoiding this solubility of the gases as much as possible i arranged the decomposing plates in a vertical position 707 708 that the bubbles might quickly escape upwards and that the downward currents in the fluid should not meet ascending currents of gas this precaution i found to assist greatly in producing constant results and especially in experiments to be hereafter referred to in which other liquids than dilute sulphuric acid as for instance solution of potash were used  721 the irregularities in the indications of the measurer proposed arising from the solubility just referred to are but small and may be very nearly corrected by comparing the results of two or three experiments they may also be almost entirely avoided by selecting that solution which is found to favour them in the least degree 728 and still further by collecting the hydrogen only and using that as the indicating gas for being much less soluble than oxygen being evolved with twice the rapidity and in larger bubbles 717 it can be collected more perfectly and in greater purity  722 from the foregoing and many other experiments it results that variation in the size of the electrodes causes no variation in the chemical action of a given quantity of electricity upon water  723 the next point in regard to which the principle of constant electrochemical action was tested was variation of intensity in the first place the preceding experiments were repeated using batteries of an equal number of plates strongly and weakly charged but the results were alike they were then repeated using batteries sometimes containing forty and at other times only five pairs of plates but the results were still the same variations therefore in the intensity caused by difference in the strength of charge or in the number of alternations used produced no difference as to the equal action of large and small electrodes  724 still these results did not prove that variation in the intensity of the current was not accompanied by a corresponding variation in the electrochemical effects since the actions at all the surfaces might have increased or diminished together the deficiency in the evidence is however completely supplied by the former experiments on differentsized electrodes for with variation in the size of these a variation in the intensity must have occurred the intensity of an electric current traversing conductors alike in their nature quality and length is probably as the quantity of electricity passing through a given sectional area perpendicular to the current divided by the time 360 note and therefore when large plates were contrasted with wires separated by an equal length of the same decomposing conductor 714 whilst one current of electricity passed through both arrangements that electricity must have been in a very different state as to tension between the plates and between the wires yet the chemical results were the same  725 the difference in intensity under the circumstances described may be easily shown practically by arranging two decomposing apparatus as in fig 67 where the same fluid is subjected to the decomposing power of the same current of electricity passing in the vessel a between large platina plates and in the vessel b between small wires if a third decomposing apparatus such as that delineated fig 66 711 be connected with the wires at ab fig 67 it will serve sufficiently well by the degree of decomposition occurring in it to indicate the relative state of the two plates as to intensity and if it then be applied in the same way as a test of the state of the wires at ab it will by the increase of decomposition within show how much greater the intensity is there than at the former points the connexions of p and n with the voltaic battery are of course to be continued during the whole time  726 a third form of experiment in which difference of intensity was obtained for the purpose of testing the principle of equal chemical action was to arrange three voltaelectrometers so that after the electric current had passed through one it should divide into two parts each of which should traverse one of the remaining instruments and should then reunite the sum of the decomposition in the two latter vessels was always equal to the decomposition in the former vessel but the intensity of the divided current could not be the same as that it had in its original state and therefore variation of intensity has no influence on the results if the quantity of electricity remain the same the experiment in fact resolves itself simply into an increase in the size of the electrodes 725  727 the third point in respect to which the principle of equal electrochemical action on water was tested was variation of the strength of the solution used in order to render the water a conductor sulphuric acid had been added to it 707 and it did not seem unlikely that this substance with many others might render the water more subject to decomposition the electricity remaining the same in quantity but such did not prove to be the case diluted sulphuric acid of different strengths was introduced into different decomposing apparatus and submitted simultaneously to the action of the same electric current 714 slight differences occurred as before sometimes in one direction sometimes in another but the final result was that exactly the same quantity of water was decomposed in all the solutions by the same quantity of electricity though the sulphuric acid in some was seventyfold what it was in others the strengths used were of specific gravity 1495 and downwards  728 when an acid having a specific gravity of about 1336 was employed the results were most uniform and the oxygen and hydrogen 716 most constantly in the right proportion to each other such an acid gave more gas than one much weaker acted upon by the same current apparently because it had less solvent power if the acid were very strong then a remarkable disappearance of oxygen took place thus one made by mixing two measures of strong oil of vitriol with one of water gave fortytwo volumes of hydrogen but only twelve of oxygen the hydrogen was very nearly the same with that evolved from acid of the specific gravity 1232 i have not yet had time to examine minutely the circumstances attending the disappearance of the oxygen in this case but imagine it is due to the formation of oxywater which thenard has shown is favoured by the presence of acid  729 although not necessary for the practical use of the instrument i am describing yet as connected with the important point of constant chemical action upon water i now investigated the effects produced by an electroelectric current passing through aqueous solutions of acids salts and compounds exceedingly different from each other in their nature and found them to yield astonishingly uniform results but many of them which are connected with a secondary action will be more usefully described hereafter 778  730 when solutions of caustic potassa or soda or sulphate of magnesia or sulphate of soda were acted upon by the electric current just as much oxygen and hydrogen was evolved from them as from the diluted sulphuric acid with which they were compared when a solution of ammonia rendered a better conductor by sulphate of ammonia 554 or a solution of subcarbonate of potassa was experimented with the hydrogen evolved was in the same quantity as that set free from the diluted sulphuric acid with which they were compared hence changes in the nature of the solution do not alter the constancy of electrolytic action upon water  731 i have already said respecting large and small electrodes that change of order caused no change in the general effect 715 the same was the case with different solutions or with different intensities and however the circumstances of an experiment might be varied the results came forth exceedingly consistent and proved that the electrochemical action was still the same  732 i consider the foregoing investigation as sufficient to prove the very extraordinary and important principle with respect to water that when subjected to the influence of the electric current a quantity of it is decomposed exactly proportionate to the quantity of electricity which has passed notwithstanding the thousand variations in the conditions and circumstances under which it may at the time be placed and further that when the interference of certain secondary effects 742 c together with the solution or recombination of the gas and the evolution of air are guarded against the products of the decomposition may be collected with such accuracy as to afford a very excellent and valuable measurer of the electricity concerned in their evolution  733 the forms of instrument which i have given figg 64 65 66 709 710 711 are probably those which will be found most useful as they indicate the quantity of electricity by the largest volume of gases and cause the least obstruction to the passage of the current the fluid which my present experience leads me to prefer is a solution of sulphuric acid of specific gravity about 1336 or from that to 125 but it is very essential that there should be no organic substance nor any vegetable acid nor other body which by being liable to the action of the oxygen or hydrogen evolved at the electrodes 773 c shall diminish their quantity or add other gases to them  734 in many cases when the instrument is used as a comparative standard or even as a measurer it may be desirable to collect the hydrogen only as being less liable to absorption or disappearance in other ways than the oxygen whilst at the same time its volume is so large as to render it a good and sensible indicator in such cases the first and second form of apparatus have been used figg 62 63 707 708 the indications obtained were very constant the variations being much smaller than in those forms of apparatus collecting both gases and they can also be procured when solutions are used in comparative experiments which yielding no oxygen or only secondary results of its action can give no indications if the educts at both electrodes be collected such is the case when solutions of ammonia muriatic acid chlorides iodides acetates or other vegetable salts c are employed  735 in a few cases as where solutions of metallic salts liable to reduction at the negative electrode are acted upon the oxygen may be advantageously used as the measuring substance this is the case for instance with sulphate of copper  736 there are therefore two general forms of the instrument which i submit as a measurer of electricity one in which both the gases of the water decomposed are collected 709 710 711 and the other in which a single gas as the hydrogen only is used 707 708 when referred to as a comparative instrument a use i shall now make of it very extensively it will not often require particular precaution in the observation but when used as an absolute measurer it will be needful that the barometric pressure and the temperature be taken into account and that the graduation of the instruments should be to one scale the hundredths and smaller divisions of a cubical inch are quite fit for this purpose and the hundredth may be very conveniently taken as indicating a degree of electricity  737 it can scarcely be needful to point out further than has been done how this instrument is to be used it is to be introduced into the course of the electric current the action of which is to be exerted anywhere else and if 60° or 70° of electricity are to be measured out either in one or several portions the current whether strong or weak is to be continued until the gas in the tube occupies that number of divisions or hundredths of a cubical inch or if a quantity competent to produce a certain effect is to be measured the effect is to be obtained and then the indication read off in exact experiments it is necessary to correct the volume of gas for changes in temperature and pressure and especially for moisturea for the latter object the voltaelectrometer fig 66 is most accurate as its gas can be measured over water whilst the others retain it over acid or saline solutions    a for a simple table of correction for moisture i may take the   liberty of referring to my chemical manipulation edition of 1830   p 376  738 i have not hesitated to apply the term degree 736 in analogy with the use made of it with respect to another most important imponderable agent namely heat and as the definite expansion of air water mercury c is there made use of to measure heat so the equally definite evolution of gases is here turned to a similar use for electricity  739 the instrument offers the only actual measurer of voltaic electricity which we at present possess for without being at all affected by variations in time or intensity or alterations in the current itself of any kind or from any cause or even of intermissions of action it takes note with accuracy of the quantity of electricity which has passed through it and reveals that quantity by inspection i have therefore named it a voltaelectrometer  740 another mode of measuring voltaelectricity may be adopted with advantage in many cases dependent on the quantities of metals or other substances evolved either as primary or as secondary results but i refrain from enlarging on this use of the products until the principles on which their constancy depends have been fully established 791 848  741 by the aid of this instrument i have been able to establish the definite character of electrochemical action in its most general sense and i am persuaded it will become of the utmost use in the extensions of the science which these views afford i do not pretend to have made its detail perfect but to have demonstrated the truth of the principle and the utility of the applicationa    a as early as the year 1811 messrs gaylussac and thénard employed   chemical decomposition as a measure of the electricity of the voltaic   pile see recherches physicochymiques p 12 the principles and   precautions by which it becomes an exact measure were of course not   then knowndec 1838   ¶ vi on the primary or secondary character of the bodies evolved at the electrodes  742 before the voltaelectrometer could be employed in determining as a general law the constancy of electrodecomposition it became necessary to examine a distinction already recognised among scientific men relative to the products of that action namely their primary or secondary character and if possible by some general rule or principle to decide when they were of the one or the other kind it will appear hereafter that great mistakes inspecting electrochemical action and its consequences have arisen from confounding these two classes of results together  743 when a substance under decomposition yields at the electrodes those bodies uncombined and unaltered which the electric current has separated then they may be considered as primary results even though themselves compounds thus the oxygen and hydrogen from water are primary results and so also are the acid and alkali themselves compound bodies evolved from sulphate of soda but when the substances separated by the current are changed at the electrodes before their appearance then they give rise to secondary results although in many cases the bodies evolved are elementary  744 these secondary results occur in two ways being sometimes due to the mutual action of the evolved substance and the matter of the electrode and sometimes to its action upon the substances contained in the body itself under decomposition thus when carbon is made the positive electrode in dilute sulphuric acid carbonic oxide and carbonic acid occasionally appear there instead of oxygen for the latter acting upon the matter of the electrode produces these secondary results or if the positive electrode in a solution of nitrate or acetate of lead be platina then peroxide of lead appears there equally a secondary result with the former but now depending upon an action of the oxygen on a substance in the solution again when ammonia is decomposed by platina electrodes nitrogen appears at the anodea but though an elementary body it is a secondary result in this case being derived from the chemical action of the oxygen electrically evolved there upon the ammonia in the surrounding solution 554 in the same manner when aqueous solutions of metallic salts are decomposed by the current the metals evolved at the cathode though elements are always secondary results and not immediate consequences of the decomposing power of the electric current    a annales de chimie 1801 tom li p 167  745 many of these secondary results are extremely valuable for instance all the interesting compounds which m becquerel has obtained by feeble electric currents are of this nature but they are essentially chemical and must in the theory of electrolytic action be carefully distinguished from those which are directly due to the action of the electric current  746 the nature of the substances evolved will often lead to a correct judgement of their primary or secondary character but is not sufficient alone to establish that point thus nitrogen is said to be attracted sometimes by the positive and sometimes by the negative electrode according to the bodies with which it may be combined 554 555 and it is on such occasions evidently viewed as a primary resulta but i think i shall show that when it appears at the positive electrode or rather at the anode it is a secondary result 748 thus also sir humphry davyb and with him the great body of chemical philosophers including myself have given the appearance of copper lead tin silver gold c at the negative electrode when their aqueous solutions were acted upon by the voltaic current as proofs that the metals as a class were attracted to that surface thus assuming the metal in each case to be a primary result these however i expect to prove are all secondary results the mere consequence of chemical action and no proofs either of the attraction or of the law announced respecting their placesc    a annales de chimie 1804 tom li p 172    b elements of chemical philosophy pp 144 161    c it is remarkable that up to 1804 it was the received opinion that   the metals were reduced by the nascent hydrogen at that date the   general opinion was reversed by hisinger and berzelius annales de   chimie 1804 tom li p 174 who stated that the metals were   evolved directly by the electricity in which opinion it appears from   that time davy coincided philosophical transactions 1826 p 388  747 but when we take to our assistance the law of constant electrochemical action already proved with regard to water 732 and which i hope to extend satisfactorily to all bodies 821 and consider the quantities as well as the nature of the substances set free a generally accurate judgement of the primary or secondary character of the results may be formed and this important point so essential to the theory of electrolyzation since it decides what are the particles directly under the influence of the current distinguishing them from such as are not affected and what are the results to be expected may be established with such degree of certainty as to remove innumerable ambiguities and doubtful considerations from this branch of the science  748 let us apply these principles to the case of ammonia and the supposed determination of nitrogen to one or the other electrode 554 555 a pure strong solution of ammonia is as bad a conductor and therefore as little liable to electrolyzation as pure water but when sulphate of ammonia is dissolved in it the whole becomes a conductor nitrogen almost and occasionally quite pure is evolved at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode the ratio of the volume of the former to that of the latter varying but being as 1 to about 3 or 4 this result would seem at first to imply that the electric current had decomposed ammonia and that the nitrogen had been determined towards the positive electrode but when the electricity used was measured out by the voltaelectrometer 707 736 it was found that the hydrogen obtained was exactly in the proportion which would have been supplied by decomposed water whilst the nitrogen had no certain or constant relation whatever when upon multiplying experiments it was found that by using a stronger or weaker solution or a more or less powerful battery the gas evolved at the anode was a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen varying both in proportion and absolute quantity whilst the hydrogen at the cathode remained constant no doubt could be entertained that the nitrogen at the anode was a secondary result depending upon the chemical action of the nascent oxygen determined to that surface by the electric current upon the ammonia in solution it was the water therefore which was electrolyzed not the ammonia further the experiment gives no real indication of the tendency of the element nitrogen to either one electrode or the other nor do i know of any experiment with nitric acid or other compounds of nitrogen which shows the tendency of this element under the influence of the electric current to pass in either direction along its course  749 as another illustration of secondary results the effects on a solution of acetate of potassa may be quoted when a very strong solution was used more gas was evolved at the anode than at the cathode in the proportion of 4 to 3 nearly that from the anode was a mixture of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid that from the cathode pure hydrogen when a much weaker solution was used less gas was evolved at the anode than at the cathode and it now contained carburetted hydrogen as well as carbonic oxide and carbonic acid this result of carburetted hydrogen at the positive electrode has a very anomalous appearance if considered as an immediate consequence of the decomposing power of the current it however as well as the carbonic oxide and acid is only a secondary result for it is the water alone which suffers electrodecomposition and it is the oxygen eliminated at the anode which reacting on the acetic acid in the midst of which it is evolved produces those substances that finally appear there this is fully proved by experiments with the voltaelectrometer 707 for then the hydrogen evolved from the acetate at the cathode is always found to be definite being exactly proportionate to the electricity which has passed through the solution and in quantity the same as the hydrogen evolved in the voltaelectrometer itself the appearance of the carbon in combination with the hydrogen at the positive electrode and its nonappearance at the negative electrode are in curious contrast with the results which might have been expected from the law usually accepted respecting the final places of the elements  750 if the salt in solution be an acetate of lead then the results at both electrodes are secondary and cannot be used to estimate or express the amount of electrochemical action except by a circuitous process 843 in place of oxygen or even the gases already described 749 peroxide of lead now appears at the positive and lead itself at the negative electrode when other metallic solutions are used containing for instance peroxides as that of copper combined with this or any other decomposable acid still more complicated results will be obtained which viewed as direct results of the electrochemical action will in their proportions present nothing but confusion but will appear perfectly harmonious and simple if they be considered as secondary results and will accord in their proportions with the oxygen and hydrogen evolved from water by the action of a definite quantity of electricity  751 i have experimented upon many bodies with a view to determine whether the results were primary or secondary i have been surprised to find how many of them in ordinary cases are of the latter class and how frequently water is the only body electrolyzed in instances where other substances have been supposed to give way some of these results i will give in as few words as possible  752 nitric acidwhen very strong it conducted well and yielded oxygen at the positive electrode no gas appeared at the negative electrode but nitrous acid and apparently nitric oxide were formed there which dissolving rendered the acid yellow or red and at last even effervescent from the spontaneous separation of nitric oxide upon diluting the acid with its bulk or more of water gas appeared at the negative electrode its quantity could be varied by variations either in the strength of the acid or of the voltaic current for that acid from which no gas separated at the cathode with a weak voltaic battery did evolve gas there with a stronger and that battery which evolved no gas there with a strong acid did cause its evolution with an acid more dilute the gas at the anode was always oxygen that at the cathode hydrogen when the quantity of products was examined by the voltaelectrometer 707 the oxygen whether from strong or weak acid proved to be in the same proportion as from water when the acid was diluted to specific gravity 124 or less the hydrogen also proved to be the same in quantity as from water hence i conclude that the nitric acid does not undergo electrolyzation but the water only that the oxygen at the anode is always a primary result but that the products at the cathode are often secondary and due to the reaction of the hydrogen upon the nitric acid  753 nitrea solution of this salt yields very variable results according as one or other form of tube is used or as the electrodes are large or small sometimes the whole of the hydrogen of the water decomposed may be obtained at the negative electrode at other times only a part of it because of the ready formation of secondary results the solution is a very excellent conductor of electricity  754 nitrate of ammonia in aqueous solution gives rise to secondary results very varied and uncertain in their proportions  755 sulphurous acidpure liquid sulphurous acid does not conduct nor suffer decomposition by the voltaic currenta but when dissolved in water the solution acquires conducting power and is decomposed yielding oxygen at the anode and hydrogen and sulphur at the cathode    a see also de la rive bibliothèque universelle tom xl p 205 or   quarterly journal of science vol xxvii p 407  756 a solution containing sulphuric acid in addition to the sulphurous acid was a better conductor it gave very little gas at either electrode that at the anode was oxygen that at the cathode pure hydrogen from the cathode also rose a white turbid stream consisting of diffused sulphur which soon rendered the whole solution milky the volumes of gases were in no regular proportion to the quantities evolved from water in the voltameter i conclude that the sulphurous acid was not at all affected by the electric current in any of these cases and that the water present was the only body electrochemically decomposed that at the anode the oxygen from the water converted the sulphurous acid into sulphuric acid and at the cathode the hydrogen electrically evolved decomposed the sulphurous acid combining with its oxygen and setting its sulphur free i conclude that the sulphur at the negative electrode was only a secondary result and in fact no part of it was found combined with the small portion of hydrogen which escaped when weak solutions of sulphurous acid were used  757 sulphuric acidi have already given my reasons for concluding that sulphuric acid is not electrolyzable ie not decomposable directly by the electric current but occasionally suffering by a secondary action at the cathode from the hydrogen evolved there 681 in the year 1800 davy considered the sulphur from sulphuric acid as the result of the action of the nascent hydrogena in 1804 hisinger and berzelius stated that it was the direct result of the action of the voltaic pileb an opinion which from that time davy seems to have adopted and which has since been commonly received by all the change of my own opinion requires that i should correct what i have already said of the decomposition of sulphuric acid in a former series of these researches 552 i do not now think that the appearance of the sulphur at the negative electrode is an immediate consequence of electrolytic action    a nicholsons quarterly journal vol iv pp 280 281    b annales de chimie 1804 tom li p 173  758 muriatic acida strong solution gave hydrogen at the negative electrode and chlorine only at the positive electrode of the latter a part acted on the platina and a part was dissolved a minute bubble of gas remained it was not oxygen but probably air previously held in solution  759 it was an important matter to determine whether the chlorine was a primary result or only a secondary product due to the action of the oxygen evolved from water at the anode upon the muriatic acid ie whether the muriatic acid was electrolyzable and if so whether the decomposition was definite  760 the muriatic acid was gradually diluted one part with six of water gave only chlorine at the anode one part with eight of water gave only chlorine with nine of water a little oxygen appeared with the chlorine but the occurrence or nonoccurrence of oxygen at these strengths depended in part on the strength of the voltaic battery used with fifteen parts of water a little oxygen with much chlorine was evolved at the anode as the solution was now becoming a bad conductor of electricity sulphuric acid was added to it this caused more ready decomposition but did not sensibly alter the proportion of chlorine and oxygen  761 the muriatic acid was now diluted with 100 times its volume of dilute sulphuric acid it still gave a large proportion of chlorine at the anode mingled with oxygen and the result was the same whether a voltaic battery of 40 pairs of plates or one containing only 5 pairs were used with acid of this strength the oxygen evolved at the anode was to the hydrogen at the cathode in volume as 17 is to 64 and therefore the chlorine would have been 30 volumes had it not been dissolved by the fluid  762 next with respect to the quantity of elements evolved on using the voltaelectrometer it was found that whether the strongest or the weakest muriatic acid were used whether chlorine alone or chlorine mingled with oxygen appeared at the anode still the hydrogen evolved at the cathode was a constant quantity ie exactly the same as the hydrogen which the same quantity of electricity could evolve from water  763 this constancy does not decide whether the muriatic acid is electrolyzed or not although it proves that if so it must be in definite proportions to the quantity of electricity used other considerations may however be allowed to decide the point the analogy between chlorine and oxygen in their relations to hydrogen is so strong as to lead almost to the certainty that when combined with that element they would perform similar parts in the process of electrodecomposition they both unite with it in single proportional or equivalent quantities and the number of proportionals appearing to have an intimate and important relation to the decomposability of a body 697 those in muriatic acid as well as in water are the most favourable or those perhaps even necessary to decomposition in other binary compounds of chlorine also where nothing equivocal depending on the simultaneous presence of it and oxygen is involved the chlorine is directly eliminated at the anode by the electric current such is the case with the chloride of lead 395 which may be justly compared with protoxide of lead 402 and stands in the same relation to it as muriatic acid to water the chlorides of potassium sodium barium c are in the same relation to the protoxides of the same metals and present the same results under the influence of the electric current 402  764 from all the experiments combined with these considerations i conclude that muriatic acid is decomposed by the direct influence of the electric current and that the quantities evolved are and therefore the chemical action is definite for a definite quantity of electricity for though i have not collected and measured the chlorine in its separate state at the anode there can exist no doubt as to its being proportional to the hydrogen at the cathode and the results are therefore sufficient to establish the general law of constant electrochemical action in the case of muriatic acid  765 in the dilute acid 761 i conclude that a part of the water is electrochemically decomposed giving origin to the oxygen which appears mingled with the chlorine at the anode the oxygen may be viewed as a secondary result but i incline to believe that it is not so for if it were it might be expected in largest proportion from the stronger acid whereas the reverse is the fact this consideration with others also leads me to conclude that muriatic acid is more easily decomposed by the electric current than water since even when diluted with eight or nine times its quantity of the latter fluid it alone gives way the water remaining unaffected  766 chlorideson using solutions of chlorides in waterfor instance the chlorides of sodium or calciumthere was evolution of chlorine only at the positive electrode and of hydrogen with the oxide of the base as soda or lime at the negative electrode the process of decomposition may be viewed as proceeding in two or three ways all terminating in the same results perhaps the simplest is to consider the chloride as the substance electrolyzed its chlorine being determined to and evolved at the anode and its metal passing to the cathode where finding no more chlorine it acts upon the water producing hydrogen and an oxide as secondary results as the discussion would detain me from more important matter and is not of immediate consequence i shall defer it for the present it is however of great consequence to state that on using the voltaelectrometer the hydrogen in both cases was definite and if the results do not prove the definite decomposition of chlorides which shall be proved elsewhere789 794 814 they are not in the slightest degree opposed to such a conclusion and do support the general law  767 hydriodic acida solution of hydriodic acid was affected exactly in the same manner as muriatic acid when strong hydrogen was evolved at the negative electrode in definite proportion to the quantity of electricity which had passed ie in the same proportion as was evolved by the same current from water and iodine without any oxygen was evolved at the positive electrode but when diluted small quantities of oxygen appeared with the iodine at the anode the proportion of hydrogen at the cathode remaining undisturbed  768 i believe the decomposition of the hydriodic acid in this case to be direct for the reasons already given respecting muriatic acid 763 764  769 iodidesa solution of iodide of potassium being subjected to the voltaic current iodine appeared at the positive electrode without any oxygen and hydrogen with free alkali at the negative electrode the same observations as to the mode of decomposition are applicable here as were made in relation to the chlorides when in solution 766  770 hydrofluoric acid and fluoridessolution of hydrofluoric acid did not appear to be decomposed under the influence of the electric current it was the water which gave way apparently the fused fluorides were electrolysed 417 but having during these actions obtained fluorine in the separate state i think it better to refer to a future series of these researches in which i purpose giving a fuller account of the results than would be consistent with propriety herea    a i have not obtained fluorine my expectations amounting to   conviction passed away one by one when subjected to rigorous   examination some very singular results were obtained and to one of   these i refer at 1340dec 1838  771 hydrocyanic acid in solution conducts very badly the definite proportion of hydrogen equal to that from water was set free at the cathode whilst at the anode a small quantity of oxygen was evolved and apparently a solution of cyanogen formed the action altogether corresponded with that on a dilute muriatic or hydriodic acid when the hydrocyanic acid was made a better conductor by sulphuric acid the same results occurred  cyanideswith a solution of the cyanide of potassium the result was precisely the same as with a chloride or iodide no oxygen was evolved at the positive electrode but a brown solution formed there for the reasons given when speaking of the chlorides 766 and because a fused cyanide of potassium evolves cyanogen at the positive electrodea i incline to believe that the cyanide in solution is directly decomposed    a it is a very remarkable thing to see carbon and nitrogen in this   case determined powerfully towards the positive surface of the voltaic   battery but it is perfectly in harmony with the theory of   electrochemical decomposition which i have advanced  772 ferrocyanic acid and the ferrocyanides as also sulphocyanic acid and the sulphocyanides presented results corresponding with those just described 771  773 acetic acidglacial acetic acid when fused 405 is not decomposed by nor does it conduct electricity on adding a little water to it still there were no signs of action on adding more water it acted slowly and about as pure water would do dilute sulphuric acid was added to it in order to make it a better conductor then the definite proportion of hydrogen was evolved at the cathode and a mixture of oxygen in very deficient quantity with carbonic acid and a little carbonic oxide at the anode hence it appears that acetic acid is not electrolyzable but that a portion of it is decomposed by the oxygen evolved at the anode producing secondary results varying with the strength of the acid the intensity of the current and other circumstances  774 acetatesone of these has been referred to already as affording only secondary results relative to the acetic acid 749 with many of the metallic acetates the results at both electrodes are secondary 746 750  acetate of soda fused and anhydrous is directly decomposed being as i believe a true electrolyte and evolving soda and acetic acid at the cathode and anode these however have no sensible duration but are immediately resolved into other substances charcoal sodiuretted hydrogen c being set free at the former and as far as i could judge under the circumstances acetic acid mingled with carbonic oxide carbonic acid c at the latter  775 tartaric acidpure solution of tartaric acid is almost as bad a conductor as pure water on adding sulphuric acid it conducted well the results at the positive electrode being primary or secondary in different proportions according to variations in the strength of the acid and the power of the electric current 752 alkaline tartrates gave a large proportion of secondary results at the positive electrode the hydrogen at the negative electrode remained constant unless certain triple metallic salts were used  776 solutions of salts containing other vegetable acids as the benzoates of sugar gum c dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid of resin albumen c dissolved in alkalies were in turn submitted to the electrolytic power of the voltaic current in all these cases secondary results to a greater or smaller extent were produced at the positive electrode  777 in concluding this division of these researches it cannot but occur to the mind that the final result of the action of the electric current upon substances placed between the electrodes instead of being simple may be very complicated there are two modes by which these substances may be decomposed either by the direct force of the electric current or by the action of bodies which that current may evolve there are also two modes by which new compounds may be formed ie by combination of the evolving substances whilst in their nascent state 658 directly with the matter of the electrode or else their combination with those bodies which being contained in or associated with the body suffering decomposition are necessarily present at the anode and cathode the complexity is rendered still greater by the circumstance that two or more of these actions may occur simultaneously and also in variable proportions to each other but it may in a great measure be resolved by attention to the principles already laid down 747  778 when aqueous solutions of bodies are used secondary results are exceedingly frequent even when the water is not present in large quantity but is merely that of combination still secondary results often ensue for instance it is very possible that in sir humphry davys decomposition of the hydrates of potassa and soda a part of the potassium produced was the result of a secondary action hence also a frequent cause for the disappearance of the oxygen and hydrogen which would otherwise be evolved and when hydrogen does not appear at the cathode in an aqueous solution it perhaps always indicates that a secondary action has taken place there no exception to this rule has as yet occurred to my observation  779 secondary actions are not confined to aqueous solutions or cases where water is present for instance various chlorides acted upon when fused 402 by platina electrodes have the chlorine determined electrically to the anode in many cases as with the chlorides of lead potassium barium c the chlorine acts on the platina and forms a compound with it which dissolves but when protochloride of tin is used the chlorine at the anode does not act upon the platina but upon the chloride already there forming a perchloride which rises in vapour 790 804 these are therefore instances of secondary actions of both kinds produced in bodies containing no water  780 the production of boron from fused borax 402 417 is also a case of secondary action for boracic acid is not decomposable by electricity 408 and it was the sodium evolved at the cathode which reacting on the boracic acid around it took oxygen from it and set boron free in the experiments formerly described  781 secondary actions have already in the hands of m becquerel produced many interesting results in the formation of compounds some of them new others imitations of those occurring naturallya it is probable they may prove equally interesting in an opposite direction ie as affording cases of analytic decomposition much information regarding the composition and perhaps even the arrangement of the particles of such bodies as the vegetable acids and alkalies and organic compounds generally will probably be obtained by submitting them to the action of nascent oxygen hydrogen chlorine c at the electrodes and the action seems the more promising because of the thorough command which we possess over attendant circumstances such as the strength of the current the size of the electrodes the nature of the decomposing conductor its strength c all of which may be expected to have their corresponding influence upon the final result  782 it is to me a great satisfaction that the extreme variety of secondary results has presented nothing opposed to the doctrine of a constant and definite electrochemical action to the particular consideration of which i shall now proceed   ¶ vii on the definite nature and extent of electrochemical decomposition  783 in the third series of these researches after proving the identity of electricities derived from different sources and showing by actual measurement the extraordinary quantity of electricity evolved by a very feeble voltaic arrangement 371 376 i announced a law derived from experiment which seemed to me of the utmost importance to the science of electricity in general and that branch of it denominated electrochemistry in particular the law was expressed thus the chemical power of a current of electricity is in direct proportion to the absolute quantity of electricity which passes 377    a annales de chimie tom xxxv p 113  784 in the further progress of the successive investigations i have had frequent occasion to refer to the same law sometimes in circumstances offering powerful corroboration of its truth 456 504 505 and the present series already supplies numerous new cases in which it holds good 704 722 726 732 it is now my object to consider this great principle more closely and to develope some of the consequences to which it leads that the evidence for it may be the more distinct and applicable i shall quote cases of decomposition subject to as few interferences from secondary results as possible effected upon bodies very simple yet very definite in their nature  785 in the first place i consider the law as so fully established with respect to the decomposition of water and under so many circumstances which might be supposed if anything could to exert an influence over it that i may be excused entering into further detail respecting that substance or even summing up the results here 732 i refer therefore to the whole of the subdivision of this series of researches which contains the account of the voltaelectrometer 704 c  786 in the next place i also consider the law as established with respect to muriatic acid by the experiments and reasoning already advanced when speaking of that substance in the subdivision respecting primary and secondary results 758 c  787 i consider the law as established also with regard to hydriodic acid by the experiments and considerations already advanced in the preceding division of this series of researches 767 768  788 without speaking with the same confidence yet from the experiments described and many others not described relating to hydrofluoric hydrocyanic ferrocyanic and sulphocyanic acids 770 771 772 and from the close analogy which holds between these bodies and the hydracids of chlorine iodine bromine c i consider these also as coming under subjection to the law and assisting to prove its truth  789 in the preceding cases except the first the water is believed to be inactive but to avoid any ambiguity arising from its presence i sought for substances from which it should be absent altogether and taking advantage of the law of conduction already developed 380 c i soon found abundance amongst which protochloride of tin was first subjected to decomposition in the following manner a piece of platina wire had one extremity coiled up into a small knob and having been carefully weighed was sealed hermetically into a piece of bottleglass tube so that the knob should be at the bottom of the tube within fig 68 the tube was suspended by a piece of platina wire so that the heat of a spiritlamp could be applied to it recently fused protochloride of tin was introduced in sufficient quantity to occupy when melted about onehalf of the tube the wire of the tube was connected with a voltaelectrometer 711 which was itself connected with the negative end of a voltaic battery and a platina wire connected with the positive end of the same battery was dipped into the fused chloride in the tube being however so bent that it could not by any shake of the hand or apparatus touch the negative electrode at the bottom of the vessel the whole arrangement is delineated in fig 69  790 under these circumstances the chloride of tin was decomposed the chlorine evolved at the positive electrode formed bichloride of tin 779 which passed away in fumes and the tin evolved at the negative electrode combined with the platina forming an alloy fusible at the temperature to which the tube was subjected and therefore never occasioning metallic communication through the decomposing chloride when the experiment had been continued so long as to yield a reasonable quantity of gas in the voltaelectrometer the battery connexion was broken the positive electrode removed and the tube and remaining chloride allowed to cool when cold the tube was broken open the rest of the chloride and the glass being easily separable from the platina wire and its button of alloy the latter when washed was then reweighed and the increase gave the weight of the tin reduced  791 i will give the particular results of one experiment in illustration of the mode adopted in this and others the results of which i shall have occasion to quote the negative electrode weighed at first 20 grains after the experiment it with its button of alloy weighed 232 grains the tin evolved by the electric current at the cathode weighed therefore 32 grains the quantity of oxygen and hydrogen collected in the voltaelectrometer  385 cubic inches as 100 cubic inches of oxygen and hydrogen in the proportions to form water may be considered as weighing 1292 grains the 385 cubic inches would weigh 049742 of a grain that being therefore the weight of water decomposed by the same electric current as was able to decompose such weight of protochloride of tin as could yield 32 grains of metal now 049742  32  9 the equivalent of water is to 579 which should therefore be the equivalent of tin if the experiment had been made without error and if the electrochemical decomposition is in this case also definite in some chemical works 58 is given as the chemical equivalent of tin in others 579 both are so near to the result of the experiment and the experiment itself is so subject to slight causes of variation as from the absorption of gas in the voltaelectrometer 716 c that the numbers leave little doubt of the applicability of the law of definite action in this and all similar cases of electrodecomposition  792 it is not often i have obtained an accordance in numbers so near as that i have just quoted four experiments were made on the protochloride of tin the quantities of gas evolved in the voltaelectrometer being from 205 to 1029 cubic inches the average of the four experiments gave 5853 as the electrochemical equivalent for tin  793 the chloride remaining after the experiment was pure protochloride of tin and no one can doubt for a moment that the equivalent of chlorine had been evolved at the anode and having formed bichloride of tin as a secondary result had passed away  794 chloride of lead was experimented upon in a manner exactly similar except that a change was made in the nature of the positive electrode for as the chlorine evolved at the anode forms no perchloride of lead but acts directly upon the platina it produces if that metal be used a solution of chloride of platina in the chloride of lead in consequence of which a portion of platina can pass to the cathode and would then produce a vitiated result i therefore sought for and found in plumbago another substance which could be used safely as the positive electrode in such bodies as chlorides iodides c  the chlorine or iodine does not act upon it but is evolved in the free state and the plumbago has no reaction under the circumstances upon the fused chloride or iodide in which it is plunged even if a few particles of plumbago should separate by the heat or the mechanical action of the evolved gas they can do no harm in the chloride  795 the mean of three experiments gave the number of 10085 as the equivalent for lead the chemical equivalent is 1035 the deficiency in my experiments i attribute to the solution of part of the gas 716 in the voltaelectrometer but the results leave no doubt on my mind that both the lead and the chlorine are in this case evolved in definite quantities by the action of a given quantity of electricity 814 c  796 chloride of antimonyit was in endeavouring to obtain the electrochemical equivalent of antimony from the chloride that i found reasons for the statement i have made respecting the presence of water in it in an earlier part of these researches 690 693 c  797 i endeavoured to experiment upon the oxide of lead obtained by fusion and ignition of the nitrate in a platina crucible but found great difficulty from the high temperature required for perfect fusion and the powerful fluxing qualities of the substance greenglass tubes repeatedly failed i at last fused the oxide in a small porcelain crucible heated fully in a charcoal fire and as it is was essential that the evolution of the lead at the cathode should take place beneath the surface the negative electrode was guarded by a greenglass tube fused around it in such a manner as to expose only the knob of platina at the lower end fig 70 so that it could be plunged beneath the surface and thus exclude contact of air or oxygen with the lead reduced there a platina wire was employed for the positive electrode that metal not being subject to any action from the oxygen evolved against it the arrangement is given in fig 71  798 in an experiment of this kind the equivalent for the lead came out 9317 which is very much too small this i believe was because of the small interval between the positive and negative electrodes in the oxide of lead so that it was not unlikely that some of the froth and bubbles formed by the oxygen at the anode should occasionally even touch the lead reduced at the cathode and reoxidize it when i endeavoured to correct this by having more litharge the greater heat required to keep it all fluid caused a quicker action on the crucible which was soon eaten through and the experiment stopped  799 in one experiment of this kind i used borate of lead 408 673 it evolves lead under the influence of the electric current at the anode and oxygen at the cathode and as the boracic acid is not either directly 408 or incidentally decomposed during the operation i expected a result dependent on the oxide of lead the borate is not so violent a flux as the oxide but it requires a higher temperature to make it quite liquid and if not very hot the bubbles of oxygen cling to the positive electrode and retard the transfer of electricity the number for lead came out 10129 which is so near to 1035 as to show that the action of the current had been definite  800 oxide of bismuthi found this substance required too high a temperature and acted too powerfully as a flux to allow of any experiment being made on it without the application of more time and care than i could give at present  801 the ordinary protoxide of antimony which consists of one proportional of metal and one and a half of oxygen was subjected to the action of the electric current in a greenglass tube 789 surrounded by a jacket of platina foil and heated in a charcoal fire the decomposition began and proceeded very well at first apparently indicating according to the general law 679 697 that this substance was one containing such elements and in such proportions as made it amenable to the power of the electric current this effect i have already given reasons for supposing may be due to the presence of a true protoxide consisting of single proportionals 696 693 the action soon diminished and finally ceased because of the formation of a higher oxide of the metal at the positive electrode this compound which was probably the peroxide being infusible and insoluble in the protoxide formed a crystalline crust around the positive electrode and thus insulating it prevented the transmission of the electricity whether if it had been fusible and still immiscible it would have decomposed is doubtful because of its departure from the required composition 697 it was a very natural secondary product at the positive electrode 779 on opening the tube it was found that a little antimony had been separated at the negative electrode but the quantity was too small to allow of any quantitative result being obtaineda    a this paragraph is subject to the corrective note now appended to   paragraph 696dec 1838  802 iodide of leadthis substance can be experimented with in tubes heated by a spiritlamp 789 but i obtained no good results from it whether i used positive electrodes of platina or plumbago in two experiments the numbers for the lead came out only 7546 and 7345 instead of 1035 this i attribute to the formation of a periodide at the positive electrode which dissolving in the mass of liquid iodide came in contact with the lead evolved at the negative electrode and dissolved part of it becoming itself again protiodide such a periodide does exist and it is very rarely that the iodide of lead formed by precipitation and wellwashed can be fused without evolving much iodine from the presence of this percompound nor does crystallization from its hot aqueous solution free it from this substance even when a little of the protiodide and iodine are merely rubbed together in a mortar a portion of the periodide is formed and though it is decomposed by being fused and heated to dull redness for a few minutes and the whole reduced to protiodide yet that is not at all opposed to the possibility that a little of that which is formed in great excess of iodine at the anode should be carried by the rapid currents in the liquid into contact with the cathode  803 this view of the result was strengthened by a third experiment where the space between the electrodes was increased to one third of an inch for now the interfering effects were much diminished and the number of the lead came out 8904 and it was fully confirmed by the results obtained in the cases of transfer to be immediately described 818  the experiments on iodide of lead therefore offer no exception to the general law under consideration but on the contrary may from general considerations be admitted as included in it  804 protiodide of tinthis substance when fused 402 conducts and is decomposed by the electric current tin is evolved at the anode and periodide of tin as a secondary result 779 790 at the cathode the temperature required for its fusion is too high to allow of the production of any results fit for weighing  805 iodide of potassium was subjected to electrolytic action in a tube like that in fig 68 789 the negative electrode was a globule of lead and i hoped in this way to retain the potassium and obtain results that could be weighed and compared with the voltaelectrometer indication but the difficulties dependent upon the high temperature required the action upon the glass the fusibility of the platina induced by the presence of the lead and other circumstances prevented me from procuring such results the iodide was decomposed with the evolution of iodine at the anode and of potassium at the cathode as in former cases  806 in some of these experiments several substances were placed in succession and decomposed simultaneously by the same electric current thus protochloride of tin chloride of lead and water were thus acted on at once it is needless to say that the results were comparable the tin lead chlorine oxygen and hydrogen evolved being definite in quantity and electrochemical equivalents to each other                                       807 let us turn to another kind of proof of the definite chemical action of electricity if any circumstances could be supposed to exert an influence over the quantity of the matters evolved during electrolytic action one would expect them to be present when electrodes of different substances and possessing very different chemical affinities for such matters were used platina has no power in dilute sulphuric acid of combining with the oxygen at the anode though the latter be evolved in the nascent state against it copper on the other hand immediately unites with the oxygen as the electric current sets it free from the hydrogen and zinc is not only able to combine with it but can without any help from the electricity abstract it directly from the water at the same time setting torrents of hydrogen free yet in cases where these three substances were used as the positive electrodes in three similar portions of the same dilute sulphuric acid specific gravity 1336 precisely the same quantity of water was decomposed by the electric current and precisely the same quantity of hydrogen set free at the cathodes of the three solutions  808 the experiment was made thus portions of the dilute sulphuric acid were put into three basins three voltaelectrometer tubes of the form figg 60 62 were filled with the same acid and one inverted in each basin 707 a zinc plate connected with the positive end of a voltaic battery was dipped into the first basin forming the positive electrode there the hydrogen which was abundantly evolved from it by the direct action of the acid being allowed to escape a copper plate which dipped into the acid of the second basin was connected with the negative electrode of the first basin and a platina plate which dipped into the acid of the third basin was connected with the negative electrode of the second basin the negative electrode of the third basin was connected with a voltaelectrometer 711 and that with the negative end of the voltaic battery  809 immediately that the circuit was complete the electrochemical action commenced in all the vessels the hydrogen still rose in apparently undiminished quantities from the positive zinc electrode in the first basin no oxygen was evolved at the positive copper electrode in the second basin but a sulphate of copper was formed there whilst in the third basin the positive platina electrode evolved pure oxygen gas and was itself unaffected but in all the basins the hydrogen liberated at the negative platina electrodes was the same in quantity and the same with the volume of hydrogen evolved in the voltaelectrometer showing that in all the vessels the current had decomposed an equal quantity of water in this trying case therefore the chemical action of electricity proved to be perfectly definite  810 a similar experiment was made with muriatic acid diluted with its bulk of water the three positive electrodes were zinc silver and platina the first being able to separate and combine with the chlorine without the aid of the current the second combining with the chlorine only after the current had set it free and the third rejecting almost the whole of it the three negative electrodes were as before platina plates fixed within glass tubes in this experiment as in the former the quantity of hydrogen evolved at the cathodes was the same for all and the same as the hydrogen evolved in the voltaelectrometer i have already given my reasons for believing that in these experiments it is the muriatic acid which is directly decomposed by the electricity 764 and the results prove that the quantities so decomposed are perfectly definite and proportionate to the quantity of electricity which has passed  811 in this experiment the chloride of silver formed in the second basin retarded the passage of the current of electricity by virtue of the law of conduction before described 394 so that it had to be cleaned off four or five times during the course of the experiment but this caused no difference between the results of that vessel and the others  812 charcoal was used as the positive electrode in both sulphuric and muriatic acids 808 810 but this change produced no variation of the results a zinc positive electrode in sulphate of soda or solution of common salt gave the same constancy of operation  813 experiments of a similar kind were then made with bodies altogether in a different state ie with fused chlorides iodides c i have already described an experiment with fused chloride of silver in which the electrodes were of metallic silver the one rendered negative becoming increased and lengthened by the addition of metal whilst the other was dissolved and eaten away by its abstraction this experiment was repeated two weighed pieces of silver wire being used as the electrodes and a voltaelectrometer included in the circuit great care was taken to withdraw the negative electrodes so regularly and steadily that the crystals of reduced silver should not form a metallic communication beneath the surface of the fused chloride on concluding the experiment the positive electrode was reweighed and its loss ascertained the mixture of chloride of silver and metal withdrawn in successive portions at the negative electrode was digested in solution of ammonia to remove the chloride and the metallic silver remaining also weighed it was the reduction at the cathode and exactly equalled the solution at the anode and each portion was as nearly as possible the equivalent to the water decomposed in the voltaelectrometer  814 the infusible condition of the silver at the temperature used and the length and ramifying character of its crystals render the above experiment difficult to perform and uncertain in its results i therefore wrought with chloride of lead using a greenglass tube formed as in fig 72 a weighed platina wire was fused into the bottom of a small tube as before described 789 the tube was then bent to an angle at about half an inch distance from the closed end and the part between the angle and the extremity being softened was forced upward as in the figure so as to form a bridge or rather separation producing two little depressions or basins a b within the tube this arrangement was suspended by a platina wire as before so that the heat of a spiritlamp could be applied to it such inclination being given to it as would allow all air to escape during the fusion of the chloride of lead a positive electrode was then provided by bending up the end of a platina wire into a knot and fusing about twenty grains of metallic lead on to it in a small closed tube of glass which was afterwards broken away being so furnished the wire with its lead was weighed and the weight recorded  815 chloride of lead was now introduced into the tube and carefully fused the leaded electrode was also introduced after which the metal at its extremity soon melted in this state of things the tube was filled up to c with melted chloride of lead the end of the electrode to be rendered negative was in the basin b and the electrode of melted lead was retained in the basin a and by connexion with the proper conducting wire of a voltaic battery was rendered positive a voltaelectrometer was included in the circuit  816 immediately upon the completion of the communication with the voltaic battery the current passed and decomposition proceeded no chlorine was evolved at the positive electrode but as the fused chloride was transparent a button of alloy could be observed gradually forming and increasing in size at b whilst the lead at a could also be seen gradually to diminish after a time the experiment was stopped the tube allowed to cool and broken open the wires with their buttons cleaned and weighed and their change in weight compared with the indication of the voltaelectrometer  817 in this experiment the positive electrode had lost just as much lead as the negative one had gained 795 and the loss and gain were very nearly the equivalents of the water decomposed in the voltaelectrometer giving for lead the number 1015 it is therefore evident in this instance that causing a strong affinity or no affinity for the substance evolved at the anode to be active during the experiment 807 produces no variation in the definite action of the electric current  818 a similar experiment was then made with iodide of lead and in this manner all confusion from the formation of a periodide avoided 803 no iodine was evolved during the whole action and finally the loss of lead at the anode was the same as the gain at the cathode the equivalent number by comparison with the result in the voltaelectrometer being 1035  819 then protochloride of tin was subjected to the electric current in the same manner using of course a tin positive electrode no bichloride of tin was now formed 779 790 on examining the two electrodes the positive had lost precisely as much as the negative had gained and by comparison with the voltaelectrometer the number for tin came out 59  820 it is quite necessary in these and similar experiments to examine the interior of the bulbs of alloy at the ends of the conducting wires for occasionally and especially with those which have been positive they are cavernous and contain portions of the chloride or iodide used which must be removed before the final weight is ascertained this is more usually the case with lead than tin  821 all these facts combine into i think an irresistible mass of evidence proving the truth of the important proposition which i at first laid down namely that the chemical power of a current of electricity is in direct proportion to the absolute quantity of electricity which passes 377 783 they prove too that this is not merely true with one substance as water but generally with all electrolytic bodies and further that the results obtained with any one substance do not merely agree amongst themselves but also with those obtained from other substances the whole combining together into one series of definite electrochemical actions 505 i do not mean to say that no exceptions will appear perhaps some may arise especially amongst substances existing only by weak affinity but i do not expect that any will seriously disturb the result announced if in the wellconsidered wellexamined and i may surely say wellascertained doctrines of the definite nature of ordinary chemical affinity such exceptions occur as they do in abundance yet without being allowed to disturb our minds as to the general conclusion they ought also to be allowed if they should present themselves at this the opening of a new view of electrochemical action not being held up as obstructions to those who may be engaged in rendering that view more and more perfect but laid aside for a while in hopes that their perfect and consistent explanation will ultimately appear                                       822 the doctrine of definite electrochemical action just laid down and i believe established leads to some new views of the relations and classifications of bodies associated with or subject to this action some of these i shall proceed to consider  823 in the first place compound bodies may be separated into two great classes namely those which are decomposable by the electric current and those which are not of the latter some are conductors others nonconductors of voltaic electricitya the former do not depend for their decomposability upon the nature of their elements only for of the same two elements bodies may be formed of which one shall belong to one class and another to the other class but probably on the proportions also 697 it is further remarkable that with very few if any exceptions 414 691 these decomposable bodies are exactly those governed by the remarkable law of conduction i have before described 694 for that law does not extend to the many compound fusible substances that are excluded from this class i propose to call bodies of this the decomposable class electrolytes 664    a i mean here by voltaic electricity merely electricity from a most   abundant source but having very small intensity  824 then again the substances into which these divide under the influence of the electric current form an exceedingly important general class they are combining bodies are directly associated with the fundamental parts of the doctrine of chemical affinity and have each a definite proportion in which they are always evolved during electrolytic action i have proposed to call these bodies generally ions or particularly anions and cations according as they appear at the anode or cathode 665 and the numbers representing the proportions in which they are evolved electrochemical equivalents thus hydrogen oxygen chlorine iodine lead tin are ions the three former are anions the two metals are cations and 1 8 3 125 104 58 are their electrochemical equivalents nearly  825 a summary of certain points already ascertained respecting electrolytes ions and electrochemical equivalents may be given in the following general form of propositions without i hope including any serious error  826 i a single ion ie one not in combination with another will have no tendency to pass to either of the electrodes and will be perfectly indifferent to the passing current unless it be itself a compound of more elementary ions and so subject to actual decomposition upon this fact is founded much of the proof adduced in favour of the new theory of electrochemical decomposition which i put forth in a former series of these researches 518 c  827 ii if one ion be combined in right proportions 697 with another strongly opposed to it in its ordinary chemical relations ie if an anion be combined with a cation then both will travel the one to the anode the other to the cathode of the decomposing body 530 542 547  828 iii if therefore an ion pass towards one of the electrodes another ion must also be passing simultaneously to the other electrode although from secondary action it may not make its appearance 743  829 iv a body decomposable directly by the electric current ie an electrolyte must consist of two ions and must also render them up during the act of decomposition  830 v there is but one electrolyte composed of the same two elementary ions at least such appears to be the fact 697 dependent upon a law that only single electrochemical equivalents of elementary ions can go to the electrodes and not multiples  831 vi a body not decomposable when alone as boracic acid is not directly decomposable by the electric current when in combination 780 it may act as an ion going wholly to the anode or cathode but does not yield up its elements except occasionally by a secondary action perhaps it is superfluous for me to point out that this proposition has no relation to such cases as that of water which by the presence of other bodies is rendered a better conductor of electricity and therefore is more freely decomposed  832 vii the nature of the substance of which the electrode is formed provided it be a conductor causes no difference in the electrodecomposition either in kind or degree 807 813 but it seriously influences by secondary action 714 the state in which the finally appear advantage may be taken of this principle in combining and ions collecting such ions as if evolved in their free state would be unmanageablea    a it will often happen that the electrodes used may be of such a   nature as with the fluid in which they are immersed to produce an   electric current either according with or opposing that of the   voltaic arrangement used and in this way or by direct chemical   action may sadly disturb the results still in the midst of all   these confusing effects the electric current which actually passes   in any direction through the body suffering decomposition will   produce its own definite electrolytic action  833 viii a substance which being used as the electrode can combine with the ion evolved against it is also i believe an ion and combines in such cases in the quantity represented by its electrochemical equivalent all the experiments i have made agree with this view and it seems to me at present to result as a necessary consequence whether in the secondary actions that take place where the ion acts not upon the matter of the electrode but on that which is around it in the liquid 744 the same consequence follows will require more extended investigation to determine  834 ix compound ions are not necessarily composed of electrochemical equivalents of simple ions for instance sulphuric acid boracic acid phosphoric acid are ions but not electrolytes ie not composed of electrochemical equivalents of simple ions  835 x electrochemical equivalents are always consistent ie the same number which represents the equivalent of a substance a when it is separating from a substance b will also represent a when separating from a third substance c thus 8 is the electrochemical equivalent of oxygen whether separating from hydrogen or tin or lead and 1035 is the electrochemical equivalent of lead whether separating from oxygen or chlorine or iodine  836 xi electrochemical equivalents coincide and are the same with ordinary chemical equivalents  837 by means of experiment and the preceding propositions a knowledge of ions and their electrochemical equivalents may be obtained in various ways  838 in the first place they may be determined directly as has been done with hydrogen oxygen lead and tin in the numerous experiments already quoted  839 in the next place from propositions ii and iii may be deduced the knowledge of many other ions and also their equivalents when chloride of lead was decomposed platina being used for both electrodes 395 there could remain no more doubt that chlorine was passing to the anode although it combined with the platina there than when the positive electrode being of plumbago 794 allowed its evolution in the free state neither could there in either case remain any doubt that for every 1035 parts of lead evolved at the cathode 36 parts of chlorine were evolved at the anode for the remaining chloride of lead was unchanged so also when in a metallic solution one volume of oxygen or a secondary compound containing that proportion appeared at the anode no doubt could arise that hydrogen equivalent to two volumes had been determined to the cathode although by a secondary action it had been employed in reducing oxides of lead copper or other metals to the metallic state in this manner then we learn from the experiments already described in these researches that chlorine iodine bromine fluorine calcium potassium strontium magnesium manganese c are ions and that their electrochemical equivalents are the same as their ordinary chemical equivalents  840 propositions iv and v extend our means of gaining information for if a body of known chemical composition is found to be decomposable and the nature of the substance evolved as a primary or even a secondary result 743 777 at one of the electrodes be ascertained the electrochemical equivalent of that body may be deduced from the known constant composition of the substance evolved thus when fused protiodide of tin is decomposed by the voltaic current 804 the conclusion may be drawn that both the iodine and tin are ions and that the proportions in which they combine in the fused compound express their electrochemical equivalents again with respect to the fused iodide of potassium 805 it is an electrolyte and the chemical equivalents will also be the electrochemical equivalents  841 if proposition viii sustain extensive experimental investigation then it will not only help to confirm the results obtained by the use of the other propositions but will give abundant original information of its own  842 in many instances the secondary results obtained by the action of the evolved ion on the substances present in the surrounding liquid or solution will give the electrochemical equivalent thus in the solution of acetate of lead and as far as i have gone in other protosalts subjected to the reducing action of the nascent hydrogen at the cathode the metal precipitated has been in the same quantity as if it had been a primary product provided no free hydrogen escaped there and therefore gave accurately the number representing its electrochemical equivalent  843 upon this principle it is that secondary results may occasionally be used as measurers of the voltaelectric current 706 740 but there are not many metallic solutions that answer this purpose well for unless the metal is easily precipitated hydrogen will be evolved at the cathode and vitiate the result if a soluble peroxide is formed at the anode or if the precipitated metal crystallize across the solution and touch the positive electrode similar vitiated results are obtained i expect to find in some salts as the acetates of mercury and zinc solutions favourable for this use  844 after the first experimental investigations to establish the definite chemical action of electricity i have not hesitated to apply the more strict results of chemical analysis to correct the numbers obtained as electrolytic results this it is evident may be done in a great number of cases without using too much liberty towards the due severity of scientific research the series of numbers representing electrochemical equivalents must like those expressing the ordinary equivalents of chemically acting bodies remain subject to the continual correction of experiment and sound reasoning  845 i give the following brief table of ions and their electrochemical equivalents rather as a specimen of a first attempt than as anything that can supply the want which must very quickly be felt of a full and complete tabular account of this class of bodies looking forward to such a table as of extreme utility if wellconstructed in developing the intimate relation of ordinary chemical affinity to electrical actions and identifying the two not to the imagination merely but to the conviction of the senses and a sound judgement i may be allowed to express a hope that the endeavour will always be to make it a table of real and not hypothetical electrochemical equivalents for we shall else overrun the facts and lose all sight and consciousness of the knowledge lying directly in our path  846 the equivalent numbers do not profess to be exact and are taken almost entirely from the chemical results of other philosophers in whom i could repose more confidence as to these points than in myself  847 table of ions  anions  oxygen           8

act with or replace each other thus for instance acids and bases act in relation to each other but they do not act in association with oxygen hydrogen or elementary substances there is indeed little or no doubt that when the electrical relations of the particles of matter come to be closely examined this division must be made the simple substances with cyanogen sulphocyanogen and one or two other compound bodies will probably form the first group and the acids and bases with such analogous compounds as may prove to be ions the second group whether these will include all ions or whether a third class of more complicated results will be required must be decided by future experiments  849 it is probable that all our present elementary bodies are ions but that is not as yet certain there are some such as carbon phosphorus nitrogen silicon boron alumium the right of which to the title of ion it is desirable to decide as soon as possible there are also many compound bodies and amongst them alumina and silica which it is desirable to class immediately by unexceptionable experiments it is also possible that all combinable bodies compound as well as simple may enter into the class of ions but at present it does not seem to me probable still the experimental evidence i have is so small in proportion to what must gradually accumulate around and bear upon this point that i am afraid to give a strong opinion upon it  850 i think i cannot deceive myself in considering the doctrine of definite electrochemical action as of the utmost importance it touches by its facts more directly and closely than any former fact or set of facts have done upon the beautiful idea that ordinary chemical affinity is a mere consequence of the electrical attractions of the particles of different kinds of matter and it will probably lead us to the means by which we may enlighten that which is at present so obscure and either fully demonstrate the truth of the idea or develope that which ought to replace it  851 a very valuable use of electrochemical equivalents will be to decide in cases of doubt what is the true chemical equivalent or definite proportional or atomic number of a body for i have such conviction that the power which governs electrodecomposition and ordinary chemical attractions is the same and such confidence in the overruling influence of those natural laws which render the former definite as to feel no hesitation in believing that the latter must submit to them also such being the case i can have no doubt that assuming hydrogen as 1 and dismissing small fractions for the simplicity of expression the equivalent number or atomic weight of oxygen is 8 of chlorine 36 of bromine 784 of lead 1035 of tin 59 c notwithstanding that a very high authority doubles several of these numbers   § 13 on the absolute quantity of electricity associated with the particles or atoms of matter   852 the theory of definite electrolytical or electrochemical action appears to me to touch immediately upon the absolute quantity of electricity or electric power belonging to different bodies it is impossible perhaps to speak on this point without committing oneself beyond what present facts will sustain and yet it is equally impossible and perhaps would be impolitic not to reason upon the subject although we know nothing of what an atom is yet we cannot resist forming some idea of a small particle which represents it to the mind and though we are in equal if not greater ignorance of electricity so as to be unable to say whether it is a particular matter or matters or mere motion of ordinary matter or some third kind of power or agent yet there is an immensity of facts which justify us in believing that the atoms of matter are in some way endowed or associated with electrical powers to which they owe their most striking qualities and amongst them their mutual chemical affinity as soon as we perceive through the teaching of dalton that chemical powers are however varied the circumstances in which they are exerted definite for each body we learn to estimate the relative degree of force which resides in such bodies and when upon that knowledge comes the fact that the electricity which we appear to be capable of loosening from its habitation for a while and conveying from place to place whilst it retains its chemical force can be measured out and being so measured is found to be as definite in its action as any of those portions which remaining associated with the particles of matter give them their chemical relation we seem to have found the link which connects the proportion of that we have evolved to the proportion of that belonging to the particles in their natural state  853 now it is wonderful to observe how small a quantity of a compound body is decomposed by a certain portion of electricity let us for instance consider this and a few other points in relation to water one grain of water acidulated to facilitate conduction will require an electric current to be continued for three minutes and three quarters of time to effect its decomposition which current must be powerful enough to retain a platina wire 1104 of an inch in thicknessa redhot in the air during the whole time and if interrupted anywhere by charcoal points will produce a very brilliant and constant star of light if attention be paid to the instantaneous discharge of electricity of tension as illustrated in the beautiful experiments of mr wheatstoneb and to what i have said elsewhere on the relation of common and voltaic electricity 371 375 it will not be too much to say that this necessary quantity of electricity is equal to a very powerful flash of lightning yet we have it under perfect command can evolve direct and employ it at pleasure and when it has performed its full work of electrolyzation it has only separated the elements of a single grain of water    a i have not stated the length of wire used because i find by   experiment as would be expected in theory that it is indifferent   the same quantity of electricity which passed in a given time can   heat an inch of platina wire of a certain diameter redhot can also   heat a hundred a thousand or any length of the same wire to the same   degree provided the cooling circumstances are the same for every part   in all cases this i have proved by the voltaelectrometer i found   that whether half an inch or eight inches were retained at one   constant temperature of dull redness equal quantities of water were   decomposed in equal times when the halfinch was used only the   centre portion of wire was ignited a fine wire may even be used as a   rough but ready regulator of a voltaic current for if it be made part   of the circuit and the larger wires communicating with it be shifted   nearer to or further apart so as to keep the portion of wire in the   circuit sensibly at the same temperature the current passing through   it will be nearly uniform    b literary gazette 1833 march 1 and 8 philosophical magazine   1833 p 201 linstitut 1833 p261  854 on the other hand the relation between the conduction of the electricity and the decomposition of the water is so close that one cannot take place without the other if the water is altered only in that small degree which consists in its having the solid instead of the fluid state the conduction is stopped and the decomposition is stopped with it whether the conduction be considered as depending upon the decomposition or not 443 703 still the relation of the two functions is equally intimate and inseparable  855 considering this close and twofold relation namely that without decomposition transmission of electricity does not occur and that for a given definite quantity of electricity passed an equally definite and constant quantity of water or other matter is decomposed considering also that the agent which is electricity is simply employed in overcoming electrical powers in the body subjected to its action it seems a probable and almost a natural consequence that the quantity which passes is the equivalent of and therefore equal to that of the particles separated ie that if the electrical power which holds the elements of a grain of water in combination or which makes a grain of oxygen and hydrogen in the right proportions unite into water when they are made to combine could be thrown into the condition of a current it would exactly equal the current required for the separation of that grain of water into its elements again  856 this view of the subject gives an almost overwhelming idea of the extraordinary quantity or degree of electric power which naturally belongs to the particles of matter but it is not inconsistent in the slightest degree with the facts which can be brought to bear on this point to illustrate this i must say a few words on the voltaic pilea    a by the term voltaic pile i mean such apparatus or arrangement of   metals as up to this time have been called so and which contain   water brine acids or other aqueous solutions or decomposable   substances 476 between their plates other kinds of electric   apparatus may be hereafter invented and i hope to construct some not   belonging to the class of instruments discovered by volta  857 intending hereafter to apply the results given in this and the preceding series of researches to a close investigation of the source of electricity in the voltaic instrument i have refrained from forming any decided opinion on the subject and without at all meaning to dismiss metallic contact or the contact of dissimilar substances being conductors but not metallic as if they had nothing to do with the origin of the current  i still am fully of opinion with davy that it is at least continued by chemical action and that the supply constituting the current is almost entirely from that source  858 those bodies which being interposed between the metals of the voltaic pile render it active are all of them electrolytes 476 and it cannot but press upon the attention of every one engaged in considering this subject that in those bodies so essential to the pile decomposition and the transmission of a current are so intimately connected that one cannot happen without the other this i have shown abundantly in water and numerous other cases 402 476 if then a voltaic trough have its extremities connected by a body capable of being decomposed as water we shall have a continuous current through the apparatus and whilst it remains in this state we may look at the part where the acid is acting upon the plates and that where the current is acting upon the water as the reciprocals of each other in both parts we have the two conditions inseparable in such bodies as these namely the passing of a current and decomposition and this is as true of the cells in the battery as of the water cell for no voltaic battery has as yet been constructed in which the chemical action is only that of combination decomposition is always included and is i believe an essential chemical part  859 but the difference in the two parts of the connected battery that is the decomposition or experimental cell and the acting cells is simply this in the former we urge the current through but it apparently of necessity is accompanied by decomposition in the latter we cause decompositions by ordinary chemical actions which are however themselves electrical and as a consequence have the electrical current and as the decomposition dependent upon the current is definite in the former case so is the current associated with the decomposition also definite in the latter 862 c  860 let us apply this in support of what i have surmised respecting the enormous electric power of each particle or atom of matter 856 i showed in a former series of these researches on the relation by measure of common and voltaic electricity that two wires one of platina and one of zinc each oneeighteenth of an inch in diameter placed fivesixteenths of an inch apart and immersed to the depth of fiveeighths of an inch in acid consisting of one drop of oil of vitriol and four ounces of distilled water at a temperature of about 60° fahr and connected at the other extremities by a copper wire eighteen feet long and oneeighteenth of an inch in thickness yielded as much electricity in little more than three seconds of time as a leyden battery charged by thirty turns of a very large and powerful plate electric machine in full action 371 this quantity though sufficient if passed at once through the head of a rat or cat to have killed it as by a flash of lightning was evolved by the mutual action of so small a portion of the zinc wire and water in contact with it that the loss of weight sustained by either would be inappreciable by our most delicate instruments and as to the water which could be decomposed by that current it must have been insensible in quantity for no trace of hydrogen appeared upon the surface of the platina during those three seconds  861 what an enormous quantity of electricity therefore is required for the decomposition of a single grain of water we have already seen that it must be in quantity sufficient to sustain a platina wire 1104 of an inch in thickness redhot in contact with the air for three minutes and three quarters 853 a quantity which is almost infinitely greater than that which could be evolved by the little standard voltaic arrangement to which i have just referred 860 871 i have endeavoured to make a comparison by the loss of weight of such a wire in a given time in such an acid according to a principle and experiment to be almost immediately described 862 but the proportion is so high that i am almost afraid to mention it it would appear that 800000 such charges of the leyden battery as i have referred to above would be necessary to supply electricity sufficient to decompose a single grain of water or if i am right to equal the quantity of electricity which is naturally associated with the elements of that grain of water endowing them with their mutual chemical affinity  862 in further proof of this high electric condition of the particles of matter and the identity as to quantity of that belonging to them with that necessary for their separation i will describe an experiment of great simplicity but extreme beauty when viewed in relation to the evolution of an electric current and its decomposing powers  863 a dilute sulphuric acid made by adding about one part by measure of oil of vitriol to thirty parts of water will act energetically upon a piece of zinc plate in its ordinary and simple state but as mr sturgeon has showna not at all or scarcely so if the surface of the metal has in the first instance been amalgamated yet the amalgamated zinc will act powerfully with platina as an electromotor hydrogen being evolved on the surface of the latter metal as the zinc is oxidized and dissolved the amalgamation is best effected by sprinkling a few drops of mercury upon the surface of the zinc the latter being moistened with the dilute acid and rubbing with the fingers or two so as to extend the liquid metal over the whole of the surface any mercury in excess forming liquid drops upon the zinc should be wiped offb    a recent experimental researches c 1830 p74 c    b the experiment may be made with pure zinc which as chemists well   know is but slightly acted upon by dilute sulphuric acid in   comparison with ordinary zinc which during the action is subject to   an infinity of voltaic actions see de la rive on this subject   bibliothèque universelle 1830 p391  864 two plates of zinc thus amalgamated were dried and accurately weighed one which we will call a weighed 1631 grains the other to be called b weighed 1483 grains they were about five inches long and 04 of an inch wide an earthenware pneumatic trough was filled with dilute sulphuric acid of the strength just described 863 and a gas jar also filled with the acid inverted in ita a plate of platina of nearly the same length but about three times as wide as the zinc plates was put up into this jar the zinc plate a was also introduced into the jar and brought in contact with the platina and at the same moment the plate b was put into the acid of the trough but out of contact with other metallic matter    a the acid was left during a night with a small piece of   unamalgamated zinc in it for the purpose of evolving such air as   might be inclined to separate and bringing the whole into a constant   state  865 strong action immediately occurred in the jar upon the contact of the zinc and platina plates hydrogen gas rose from the platina and was collected in the jar but no hydrogen or other gas rose from either zinc plate in about ten or twelve minutes sufficient hydrogen having been collected the experiment was stopped during its progress a few small bubbles had appeared upon plate b but none upon plate a the plates were washed in distilled water dried and reweighed plate b weighed 1483 grains as before having lost nothing by the direct chemical action of the acid plate a weighed 15465 grains 845 grains of it having been oxidized and dissolved during the experiment  866 the hydrogen gas was next transferred to a watertrough and measured it amounted to 125 cubic inches the temperature being 52° and the barometer 292 inches this quantity corrected for temperature pressure and moisture becomes 1215453 cubic inches of dry hydrogen at mean temperature and pressure which increased by one half for the oxygen that must have gone to the anode ie to the zinc gives 18232 cubic inches as the quantity of oxygen and hydrogen evolved from the water decomposed by the electric current according to the estimate of the weight of the mixed gas before adopted 791 this volume is equal to 23535544 grains which therefore is the weight of water decomposed and this quantity is to 845 the quantity of zinc oxidized as 9 is to 3231 now taking 9 as the equivalent number of water the number 325 is given as the equivalent number of zinc a coincidence sufficiently near to show what indeed could not but happen that for an equivalent of zinc oxidized an equivalent of water must be decomposeda    a the experiment was repeated several times with the same results  867 but let us observe how the water is decomposed it is electrolyzed ie is decomposed voltaically and not in the ordinary manner as to appearance of chemical decompositions for the oxygen appears at the anode and the hydrogen at the cathode of the body under decomposition and these were in many parts of the experiment above an inch asunder again the ordinary chemical affinity was not enough under the circumstances to effect the decomposition of the water as was abundantly proved by the inaction on plate b the voltaic current was essential and to prevent any idea that the chemical affinity was almost sufficient to decompose the water and that a smaller current of electricity might under the circumstances cause the hydrogen to pass to the cathode i need only refer to the results which i have given 807 813 to shew that the chemical action at the electrodes has not the slightest influence over the quantities of water or other substances decomposed between them but that they are entirely dependent upon the quantity of electricity which passes  868 what then follows as a necessary consequence of the whole experiment why this that the chemical action upon 3231 parts or one equivalent of zinc in this simple voltaic circle was able to evolve such quantity of electricity in the form of a current as passing through water should decompose 9 parts or one equivalent of that substance and considering the definite relations of electricity as developed in the preceding parts of the present paper the results prove that the quantity of electricity which being naturally associated with the particles of matter gives them their combining power is able when thrown into a current to separate those particles from their state of combination or in other words that the electricity which decomposes and that which is evolved by the decomposition of a certain quantity of matter are alike  869 the harmony which this theory of the definite evolution and the equivalent definite action of electricity introduces into the associated theories of definite proportions and electrochemical affinity is very great according to it the equivalent weights of bodies are simply those quantities of them which contain equal quantities of electricity or have naturally equal electric powers it being the electricity which determines the equivalent number because it determines the combining force or if we adopt the atomic theory or phraseology then the atoms of bodies which are equivalents to each other in their ordinary chemical action have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with them but i must confess i am jealous of the term atom for though it is very easy to talk of atoms it is very difficult to form a clear idea of their nature especially when compound bodies are under consideration  870 i cannot refrain from recalling here the beautiful idea put forth i believe by berzelius 703 in his development of his views of the electrochemical theory of affinity that the heat and light evolved during cases of powerful combination are the consequence of the electric discharge which is at the moment taking place the idea is in perfect accordance with the view i have taken of the quantity of electricity associated with the particles of matter  871 in this exposition of the law of the definite action of electricity and its corresponding definite proportion in the particles of bodies i do not pretend to have brought as yet every case of chemical or electrochemical action under its dominion there are numerous considerations of a theoretical nature especially respecting the compound particles of matter and the resulting electrical forces which they ought to possess which i hope will gradually receive their development and there are numerous experimental cases as for instance those of compounds formed by weak affinities the simultaneous decomposition of water and salts c which still require investigation but whatever the results on these and numerous other points may be i do not believe that the facts which i have advanced or even the general laws deduced from them will suffer any serious change and they are of sufficient importance to justify their publication though much may yet remain imperfect or undone indeed it is the great beauty of our science chemistry that advancement in it whether in a degree great or small instead of exhausting the subjects of research opens the doors to further and more abundant knowledge overflowing with beauty and utility to those who will be at the easy personal pains of undertaking its experimental investigation  872 the definite production of electricity 868 in association with its definite action proves i think that the current of electricity in the voltaic pile is sustained by chemical decomposition or rather by chemical action and not by contact only but here as elsewhere 857 i beg to reserve my opinion as to the real action of contact not having yet been able to make up my mind as to whether it is an exciting cause of the current or merely necessary to allow of the conduction of electricity otherwise generated from one metal to the other  873 but admitting that chemical action is the source of electricity what an infinitely small fraction of that which is active do we obtain and employ in our voltaic batteries zinc and platina wires oneeighteenth of an inch in diameter and about half an inch long dipped into dilute sulphuric acid so weak that it is not sensibly sour to the tongue or scarcely to our most delicate testpapers will evolve more electricity in onetwentieth of a minute 860 than any man would willingly allow to pass through his body at once the chemical action of a grain of water upon four grains of zinc can evolve electricity equal in quantity to that of a powerful thunderstorm 868 861 nor is it merely true that the quantity is active it can be directed and made to perform its full equivalent duty 867 c is there not then great reason to hope and believe that by a closer experimental investigation of the principles which govern the development and action of this subtile agent we shall be able to increase the power of our batteries or invent new instruments which shall a thousandfold surpass in energy those which we at present possess  874 here for a while i must leave the consideration of the definite chemical action of electricity but before i dismiss this series of experimental researches i would call to mind that in a former series i showed the current of electricity was also definite in its magnetic action 216 366 367 376 377 and though this result was not pursued to any extent i have no doubt that the success which has attended the development of the chemical effects is not more than would accompany an investigation of the magnetic

active voltaic battery  received april 7read june 5 1831   ¶ i on simple voltaic circles   875 the great question of the source of electricity in the voltaic pile has engaged the attention of so many eminent philosophers that a man of liberal mind and able to appreciate their powers would probably conclude although he might not have studied the question that the truth was somewhere revealed but if in pursuance of this impression he were induced to enter upon the work of collating results and conclusions he would find such contradictory evidence such equilibrium of opinion such variation and combination of theory as would leave him in complete doubt respecting what he should accept as the true interpretation of nature he would be forced to take upon himself the labour of repeating and examining the facts and then use his own judgement on them in preference to that of others  876 this state of the subject must to those who have made up their minds on the matter be my apology for entering upon its investigation the views i have taken of the definite action of electricity in decomposing bodies 783 and the identity of the power so used with the power to be overcome 855 founded not on a mere opinion or general notion but on facts which being altogether new were to my mind precise and conclusive gave me as i conceived the power of examining the question with advantages not before possessed by any and which might compensate on my part for the superior clearness and extent of intellect on theirs such are the considerations which have induced me to suppose i might help in deciding the question and be able to render assistance in that great service of removing doubtful knowledge such knowledge is the early morning light of every advancing science and is essential to its development but the man who is engaged in dispelling that which is deceptive in it and revealing more clearly that which is true is as useful in his place and as necessary to the general progress of the science as he who first broke through the intellectual darkness and opened a path into knowledge before unknown to man  877 the identity of the force constituting the voltaic current or electrolytic agent with that which holds the elements of electrolytes together 855 or in other words with chemical affinity seemed to indicate that the electricity of the pile itself was merely a mode of exertion or exhibition or existence of true chemical action or rather of its cause and i have consequently already said that i agree with those who believe that the supply of electricity is due to chemical powers 857  878 but the great question of whether it is originally due to metallic contact or to chemical action ie whether it is the first or the second which originates and determines the current was to me still doubtful and the beautiful and simple experiment with amalgamated zinc and platina which i have described minutely as to its results 863 c did not decide the point for in that experiment the chemical action does not take place without the contact of the metals and the metallic contact is inefficient without the chemical action hence either might be looked upon as the determining cause of the current  879 i thought it essential to decide this question by the simplest possible forms of apparatus and experiment that no fallacy might be inadvertently admitted the wellknown difficulty of effecting decomposition by a single pair of plates except in the fluid exciting them into action 863 seemed to throw insurmountable obstruction in the way of such experiments but i remembered the easy decomposability of the solution of iodide of potassium 316 and seeing no theoretical reason if metallic contact was not essential why true electrodecomposition should not be obtained without it even in a single circuit i persevered and succeeded  880 a plate of zinc about eight inches long and half an inch wide was cleaned and bent in the middle to a right angle fig 73 a plate vi a plate of platina about three inches long and half an inch wide was fastened to a platina wire and the latter bent as in the figure b these two pieces of metal were arranged together as delineated but as yet without the vessel c and its contents which consisted of dilute sulphuric acid mingled with a little nitric acid at x a piece of folded bibulous paper moistened in a solution of iodide of potassium was placed on the zinc and was pressed upon by the end of the platina wire when under these circumstances the plates were dipped into the acid of the vessel c there was an immediate effect at x the iodide being decomposed and iodine appearing at the anode 663 ie against the end of the platina wire  881 as long as the lower ends of the plates remained in the acid the electric current continued and the decomposition proceeded at x on removing the end of the wire from place to place on the paper the effect was evidently very powerful and on placing a piece of turmeric paper between the white paper and zinc both papers being moistened with the solution of iodide of potassium alkali was evolved at the cathode 663 against the zinc in proportion to the evolution of iodine at the anode hence the decomposition was perfectly polar and decidedly dependent upon a current of electricity passing from the zinc through the acid to the platina in the vessel c and back from the platina through the solution to the zinc at the paper x  882 that the decomposition at x was a true electrolytic action due to a current determined by the state of things in the vessel c and not dependent upon any mere direct chemical action of the zinc and platina on the iodide or even upon any current which the solution of iodide might by its action on those metals tend to form at x was shown in the first place by removing the vessel c and its acid from the plates when all decomposition at x ceased and in the next by connecting the metals either in or out of the acid together when decomposition of the iodide at x occurred but in a reverse order for now alkali appeared against the end of the platina wire and the iodine passed to the zinc the current being the contrary of what it was in the former instance and produced directly by the difference of action of the solution in the paper on the two metals the iodine of course combined with the zinc  883 when this experiment was made with pieces of zinc amalgamated over the whole surface 863 the results were obtained with equal facility and in the same direction even when only dilute sulphuric acid was contained in the vessel c fig 73 whichsoever end of the zinc was immersed in the acid still the effects were the same so that if for a moment the mercury might be supposed to supply the metallic contact the inversion of the amalgamated piece destroys that objection the use of unamalgamated zinc 880 removes all possibility of doubta    a the following is a more striking mode of making the above   elementary experiment prepare a plate of zinc ten or twelve inches   long and two inches wide and clean it thoroughly provide also two   discs of clean platina about one inch and a half in diameterdip   three or four folds of bibulous paper into a strong solution of iodide   of potassium place them on the clean zinc at one end of the plate   and put on them one of the platina discs finally dip similar folds of   paper or a piece of linen cloth into a mixture of equal parts nitric   acid and water and place it at the other end of the zinc plate with   the second platina disc upon it in this state of things no change at   the solution of the iodide will be perceptible but if the two discs   be connected by a platina or any other wire for a second or two and   then that over the iodide be raised it will be found that the whole   of the surface beneath is deeply stained with evolved iodinedec   1838  884 when in pursuance of other views 930 the vessel c was made to contain a solution of caustic potash in place of acid still the same results occurred decomposition of the iodide was effected freely though there was no metallic contact of dissimilar metals and the current of electricity was in the same direction as when acid was used at the place of excitement  885 even a solution of common salt in the glass c could produce all these effects  886 having made a galvanometer with platina wires and introduced it into the course of the current between the platina plate and the place of decomposition x it was affected giving indications of currents in the same direction as those shown to exist by the chemical action  887 if we consider these results generally they lead to very important conclusions in the first place they prove in the most decisive manner that metallic contact is not necessary for the production of the voltaic current in the next place they show a most extraordinary mutual relation of the chemical affinities of the fluid which excites the current and the fluid which is decomposed by it  888 for the purpose of simplifying the consideration let us take the experiment with amalgamated zinc the metal so prepared exhibits no effect until the current can pass it at the same time introduces no new action but merely removes an influence which is extraneous to those belonging either to the production or the effect of the electric current under investigation 1000 an influence also which when present tends only to confuse the results  889 let two plates one of amalgamated zinc and the other of platina be placed parallel to each other fig 74 and introduce a drop of dilute sulphuric acid y between them at one end there will be no sensible chemical action at that spot unless the two plates are connected somewhere else as at pz by a body capable of conducting electricity if that body be a metal or certain forms of carbon then the current passes and as it circulates through the fluid at y decomposition ensues  890 then remove the acid from y and introduce a drop of the solution of iodide of potassium at x fig 75 exactly the same set of effects occur except that when the metallic communication is made at pz the electric current is in the opposite direction to what it was before as is indicated by the arrows which show the courses of the currents 667  891 now both the solutions used are conductors but the conduction in them is essentially connected with decomposition 858 in a certain constant order and therefore the appearance of the elements in certain places shows in what direction a current has passed when the solutions are thus employed moreover we find that when they are used at opposite ends of the plates as in the last two experiments 889 890 metallic contact being allowed at the other extremities the currents are in opposite directions we have evidently therefore the power of opposing the actions of the two fluids simultaneously to each other at the opposite ends of the plates using each one as a conductor for the discharge of the current of electricity which the other tends to generate in fact substituting them for metallic contact and combining both experiments into one fig 76 under these circumstances there is an opposition of forces the fluid which brings into play the stronger set of chemical affinities for the zinc being the dilute acid overcomes the force of the other and determines the formation and direction of the electric current not merely making that current pass through the weaker liquid but actually reversing the tendency which the elements of the latter have in relation to the zinc and platina if not thus counteracted and forcing them in the contrary direction to that they are inclined to follow that its own current may have free course if the dominant action at y be removed by making metallic contact there then the liquid at x resumes its power or if the metals be not brought into contact at y but the affinities of the solution there weakened whilst those active x are strengthened then the latter gains the ascendency and the decompositions are produced in a contrary order  892 before drawing a final conclusion from this mutual dependence and state of the chemical affinities of two distant portions of acting fluids 916 i will proceed to examine more minutely the various circumstances under which the reaction of the body suffering decomposition is rendered evident upon the action of the body also undergoing decomposition which produces the voltaic current  893 the use of metallic contact in a single pair of plates and the cause of its great superiority above contact made by other kinds of matter become now very evident when an amalgamated zinc plate is dipped into dilute sulphuric acid the force of chemical affinity exerted between the metal and the fluid is not sufficiently powerful to cause sensible action at the surfaces of contact and occasion the decomposition of water by the oxidation of the metal although it is sufficient to produce such a condition of the electricity or the power upon which chemical affinity depends as would produce a current if there were a path open for it 916 956 and that current would complete the conditions necessary under the circumstances for the decomposition of the water  894 now the presence of a piece of platina touching both the zinc and the fluid to be decomposed opens the path required for the electricity its direct communication with the zinc is effectual far beyond any communication made between it and that metal ie between the platina and zinc by means of decomposable conducting bodies or in other words electrolytes as in the experiment already described 891 because when they are used the chemical affinities between them and the zinc produce a contrary and opposing action to that which is influential in the dilute sulphuric acid or if that action be but small still the affinity of their component parts for each other has to be overcome for they cannot conduct without suffering decomposition and this decomposition is found experimentally to react back upon the forces which in the acid tend to produce the current 904 910 c and in numerous cases entirely to neutralize them where direct contact of the zinc and platina occurs these obstructing forces are not brought into action and therefore the production and the circulation of the electric current and the concomitant action of decomposition are then highly favoured  895 it is evident however that one of these opposing actions may be dismissed and yet an electrolyte be used for the purpose of completing the circuit between the zinc and platina immersed separately into the dilute acid for if in fig 73 the platina wire be retained in metallic contact with the zinc plate a at x and a division of the platina be made elsewhere as at s then the solution of iodide placed there being in contact with platina at both surfaces exerts no chemical affinities for that metal or if it does they are equal on both sides its power therefore of forming a current in opposition to that dependent upon the action of the acid in the vessel c is removed and only its resistance to decomposition remains as the obstacle to be overcome by the affinities exerted in the dilute sulphuric acid  896 this becomes the condition of a single pair of active plates where metallic contact is allowed in such cases only one set of opposing affinities are to be overcome by those which are dominant in the vessel c whereas when metallic contact is not allowed two sets of opposing affinities must be conquered 894  897 it has been considered a difficult and by some an impossible thing to decompose bodies by the current from a single pair of plates even when it was so powerful as to heat bars of metal redhot as in the case of hares calorimeter arranged as a single voltaic circuit or of wollastons powerful single pair of metals this difficulty has arisen altogether from the antagonism of the chemical affinity engaged in producing the current with the chemical affinity to be overcome and depends entirely upon their relative intensity for when the sum of forces in one has a certain degree of superiority over the sum of forces in the other the former gain the ascendency determine the current and overcome the latter so as to make the substance exerting them yield up its elements in perfect accordance both as to direction and quantity with the course of those which are exerting the most intense and dominant action  898 water has generally been the substance the decomposition of which has been sought for as a chemical test of the passage of an electric current but i now began to perceive a reason for its failure and for a fact which i had observed long before 315 316 with regard to the iodide of potassium namely that bodies would differ in facility of decomposition by a given electric current according to the condition and intensity of their ordinary chemical affinities this reason appeared in their reaction upon the affinities tending to cause the current and it appeared probable that many substances might be found which could be decomposed by the current of a single pair of zinc and platina plates immersed in dilute sulphuric acid although water resisted its action i soon found this to be the case and as the experiments offer new and beautiful proofs of the direct relation and opposition of the chemical affinities concerned in producing and in resisting the stream of electricity i shall briefly describe them  899 the arrangement of the apparatus was as in fig 77 the vessel v contained dilute sulphuric acid z and p are the zinc and platina plates a b and c are platina wires the decompositions were effected at x and occasionally indeed generally a galvanometer was introduced into the circuit at g its place only is here given the circle at g having no reference to the size of the instrument various arrangements were made at x according to the kind of decomposition to be effected if a drop of liquid was to be acted upon the two ends were merely dipped into it if a solution contained in the pores of paper was to be decomposed one of the extremities was connected with a platina plate supporting the paper whilst the other extremity rested on the paper e fig 81 or sometimes as with sulphate of soda a plate of platina sustained two portions of paper one of the ends of the wires resting upon each piece c fig 86 the darts represent the direction of the electric current 667  900 solution of iodide of potassium in moistened paper being placed at the interruption of the circuit at x was readily decomposed iodine was evolved at the anode and alkali at the cathode of the decomposing body  901 protochloride of tin when fused and placed at x was also readily decomposed yielding perchloride of tin at the anode 779 and tin at the cathode  902 fused chloride of silver placed at x was also easily decomposed chlorine was evolved at the anode and brilliant metallic silver either in films upon the surface of the liquid or in crystals beneath evolved at the cathode  903 water acidulated with sulphuric acid solution of muriatic acid solution of sulphate of soda fused nitre and the fused chloride and iodide of lead were not decomposed by this single pair of plates excited only by dilute sulphuric acid  904 these experiments give abundant proofs that a single pair of plates can electrolyze bodies and separate their elements they also show in a beautiful manner the direct relation and opposition of the chemical affinities concerned at the two points of action in those cases where the sum of the opposing affinities at x was sufficiently beneath the sum of the acting affinities in v decomposition took place but in those cases where they rose higher decomposition was effectually resisted and the current ceased to pass 891  905 it is however evident that the sum of acting affinities in v may be increased by using other fluids than dilute sulphuric acid in which latter case as i believe it is merely the affinity of the zinc for the oxygen already combined with hydrogen in the water that is exerted in producing the electric current 919 and when the affinities are so increased the view i am supporting leads to the conclusion that bodies which resisted in the preceding experiments would then be decomposed because of the increased difference between their affinities and the acting affinities thus exalted this expectation was fully confirmed in the following manner  906 a little nitric acid was added to the liquid in the vessel r so as to make a mixture which i shall call diluted nitrosulphuric acid on repeating the experiments with this mixture all the substances before decomposed again gave way and much more readily but besides that many which before resisted electrolyzation now yielded up their elements thus solution of sulphate of soda acted upon in the interstices of litmus and turmeric paper yielded acid at the anode and alkali at the cathode solution of muriatic acid tinged by indigo yielded chlorine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode solution of nitrate of silver yielded silver at the cathode again fused nitre and the fused iodide and chloride of lead were decomposable by the current of this single pair of plates though they were not by the former 903  907 a solution of acetate of lead was apparently not decomposed by this pair nor did water acidulated by sulphuric acid seem at first to give way 973  908 the increase of intensity or power of the current produced by a simple voltaic circle with the increase of the force of the chemical action at the exciting place is here sufficiently evident but in order to place it in a clearer point of view and to show that the decomposing effect was not at all dependent in the latter cases upon the mere capability of evolving more electricity experiments were made in which the quantity evolved could be increased without variation in the intensity of the exciting cause thus the experiments in which dilute sulphuric acid was used 899 were repeated using large plates of zinc and platina in the acid but still those bodies which resisted decomposition before resisted it also under these new circumstances then again where nitrosulphuric acid was used 906 mere wires of platina and zinc were immersed in the exciting acid yet notwithstanding this change those bodies were now decomposed which resisted any current tending to be formed by the dilute sulphuric acid for instance muriatic acid could not be decomposed by a single pair of plates when immersed in dilute sulphuric acid nor did making the solution of sulphuric acid strong nor enlarging the size of the zinc and platina plates immersed in it increase the power but if to a weak sulphuric acid a very little nitric acid was added then the electricity evolved had power to decompose the muriatic acid evolving chlorine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode even when mere wires of metals were used this mode of increasing the intensity of the electric current as it excludes the effect dependent upon many pairs of plates or even the effect of making any one acid stronger or weaker is at once referable to the condition and force of the chemical affinities which are brought into action and may both in principle and practice be considered as perfectly distinct from any other mode  909 the direct reference which is thus experimentally made in the simple voltaic circle of the intensity of the electric current to the intensity of the chemical action going on at the place where the existence and direction of the current is determined leads to the conclusion that by using selected bodies as fused chlorides salts solutions of acids c which may act upon the metals employed with different degrees of chemical force and using also metals in association with platina or with each other which shall differ in the degree of chemical action exerted between them and the exciting fluid or electrolyte we shall be able to obtain a series of comparatively constant effects due to electric currents of different intensities which will serve to assist in the construction of a scale competent to supply the means of determining relative degrees of intensity with accuracy in future researchesa    a in relation to this difference and its probable cause see   considerations on inductive polarization 1354 cdec 1838  910 i have already expressed the view which i take of the decomposition in the experimental place as being the direct consequence of the superior exertion at some other spot of the same kind of power as that to be overcome and therefore as the result of an antagonism of forces of the same nature 891 904 those at the place of decomposition have a reaction upon and a power over the exerting or determining set proportionate to what is needful to overcome their own power and hence a curious result of resistance offered by decompositions to the original determining force and consequently to the current this is well shown in the cases where such bodies as chloride of lead iodide of lead and water would not decompose with the current produced by a single pair of zinc and platina plates in sulphuric acid 903 although they would with a current of higher intensity produced by stronger chemical powers in such cases no sensible portion of the current passes 967 the action is stopped and i am now of opinion that in the case of the law of conduction which i described in the fourth series of these researches 413 the bodies which are electrolytes in the fluid state cease to be such in the solid form because the attractions of the particles by which they are retained in combination and in their relative position are then too powerful for the electric currenta the particles retain their places and as decomposition is prevented the transmission of the electricity is prevented also and although a battery of many plates may be used yet if it be of that perfect kind which allows of no extraneous or indirect action 1000 the whole of the affinities concerned in the activity of that battery are at the same time also suspended and counteracted    a refer onwards to 1705dec 1838  911 but referring to the resistance of each single case of decomposition it would appear that as these differ in force according to the affinities by which the elements in the substance tend to retain their places they also would supply cases constituting a series of degrees by which to measure the initial intensities of simple voltaic or other currents of electricity and which combined with the scale of intensities determined by different degrees of acting force 909 would probably include a sufficient set of differences to meet almost every important case where a reference to intensity would be required  912 according to the experiments i have already had occasion to make i find that the following bodies are electrolytic in the order in which i have placed them those which are first being decomposed by the current of lowest intensity these currents were always from a single pair of plates and may be considered as elementary voltaic forces  iodide of potassium solution chloride of silver fused protochloride of tin fused chloride of lead fused iodide of lead fused muriatic acid solution water acidulated with sulphuric acid  913 it is essential that in all endeavours to obtain the relative electrolytic intensity necessary for the decomposition of different bodies attention should be paid to the nature of the electrodes and the other bodies present which may favour secondary actions 986 if in electrodecomposition one of the elements separated has an affinity for the electrode or for bodies present in the surrounding fluid then the affinity resisting decomposition is in part balanced by such power and the true place of the electrolyte in a table of the above kind is not obtained thus chlorine combines with a positive platina electrode freely but iodine scarcely at all and therefore i believe it is that the fused chlorides stand first in the preceding table again if in the decomposition of water not merely sulphuric but also a little nitric acid be present then the water is more freely decomposed for the hydrogen at the cathode is not ultimately expelled but finds oxygen in the nitric acid with which it can combine to produce a secondary result the affinities opposing decomposition are in this way diminished and the elements of the water can then be separated by a current of lower intensity  914 advantage may be taken of this principle to interpolate more minute degrees into the scale of initial intensities already referred to 909 911 than is there spoken of for by combining the force of a current constant in its intensity with the use of electrodes consisting of matter having more or less affinity for the elements evolved from the decomposing electrolyte various intermediate degrees may be obtained                                            915 returning to the consideration of the source of electricity 878 c there is another proof of the most perfect kind that metallic contact has nothing to do with the production of electricity in the voltaic circuit and further that electricity is only another mode of the exertion of chemical forces it is the production of the electric spark before any contact of metals is made and by the exertion of pure and unmixed chemical forces the experiment which will be described further on 956 consists in obtaining the spark upon making contact between a plate of zinc and a plate of copper plunged into dilute sulphuric acid in order to make the arrangement as elementary as possible mercurial surfaces were dismissed and the contact made by a copper wire connected with the copper plate and then brought to touch a clean part of the zinc plate the electric spark appeared and it must of necessity have existed and passed before the zinc and the copper were in contact  916 in order to render more distinct the principles which i have been endeavouring to establish i will restate them in their simplest form according to my present belief the electricity of the voltaic pile 856 note is not dependent either in its origin or its continuance upon the contact of the metals with each other 880 915 it is entirely due to chemical action 882 and is proportionate in its intensity to the intensity of the affinities concerned in its production 908 and in its quantity to the quantity of matter which has been chemically active during its evolution 869 this definite production is again one of the strongest proofs that the electricity is of chemical origin  917 as voltaelectrogeneration is a case of mere chemical action so voltaelectrodecomposition is simply a case of the preponderance of one set of chemical affinities more powerful in their nature over another set which are less powerful and if the instance of two opposing sets of such forces 891 be considered and their mutual relation and dependence borne in mind there appears no necessity for using in respect to such cases any other term than chemical affinity though that of electricity may be very convenient or supposing any new agent to be concerned in producing the results for we may consider that the powers at the two places of action are in direct communion and balanced against each other through the medium of the metals 891 fig 76 in a manner analogous to that in which mechanical forces are balanced against each other by the intervention of the lever 1031  918 all the facts show us that that power commonly called chemical affinity can be communicated to a distance through the metals and certain forms of carbon that the electric current is only another form of the forces of chemical affinity that its power is in proportion to the chemical affinities producing it that when it is deficient in force it may be helped by calling in chemical aid the want in the former being made up by an equivalent of the latter that in other words the forces termed chemical affinity and electricity are one and the same  919 when the circumstances connected with the production of electricity in the ordinary voltaic circuit are examined and compared it appears that the source of that agent always meaning the electricity which circulates and completes the current in the voltaic apparatus and gives that apparatus power and character 947 996 exists in the chemical action which takes place directly between the metal and the body with which it combines and not at all in the subsequent action of the substance so produced with the acid presenta thus when zinc platina and dilute sulphuric acid are used it is the union of the zinc with the oxygen of the water which determines the current and though the acid is essential to the removal of the oxide so formed in order that another portion of zinc may act on another portion of water it does not by combination with that oxide produce any sensible portion of the current of electricity which circulates for the quantity of electricity is dependent upon the quantity of zinc oxidized and in definite proportion to it its intensity is in proportion to the intensity of the chemical affinity of the zinc for the oxygen under the circumstances and is scarcely if at all affected by the use of either strong or weak acid 908    a wollaston philosophical transactions 1801 p 427  920 again if zinc platina and muriatic acid are used the electricity appears to be dependent upon the affinity of the zinc for the chlorine and to be circulated in exact proportion to the number of particles of zinc and chlorine which unite being in fact an equivalent to them  921 but in considering this oxidation or other direct action upon the metal itself as the cause and source of the electric current it is of the utmost importance to observe that the oxygen or other body must be in a peculiar condition namely in the state of combination and not only so but limited still further to such a state of combination and in such proportions as will constitute an electrolyte 823 a pair of zinc and platina plates cannot be so arranged in oxygen gas as to produce a current of electricity or act as a voltaic circle even though the temperature may be raised so high as to cause oxidation of the zinc far more rapidly than if the pair of plates were plunged into dilute sulphuric acid for the oxygen is not part of an electrolyte and cannot therefore conduct the forces onwards by decomposition or even as metals do by itself or if its gaseous state embarrass the minds of some then liquid chlorine may be taken it does not excite a current of electricity through the two plates by combining with the zinc for its particles cannot transfer the electricity active at the point of combination across to the platina it is not a conductor of itself like the metals nor is it an electrolyte so as to be capable of conduction during decomposition and hence there is simple chemical action at the spot and no electric currenta    a i do not mean to affirm that no traces of electricity ever appear   in such cases what i mean is that no electricity is evolved in any   way due or related to the causes which excite voltaic electricity or   proportionate to them that which does appear occasionally is the   smallest possible fraction of that which the acting matter could   produce if arranged so as to act voltaically probably not the one   hundred thousandth or even the millionth part and is very probably   altogether different in its source  922 it might at first be supposed that a conducting body not electrolytic might answer as the third substance between the zinc and the platina and it is true that we have some such capable of exerting chemical action upon the metals they must however be chosen from the metals themselves for there are no bodies of this kind except those substances and charcoal to decide the matter by experiment i made the following arrangement melted tin was put into a glass tube bent into the form of the letter v fig 78 so as to fill the half of each limb and two pieces of thick platina wire p w inserted so as to have their ends immersed some depth in the tin the whole was then allowed to cool and the ends p and w connected with a delicate galvanometer the part of the tube at x was now reheated whilst the portion y was retained cool the galvanometer was immediately influenced by the thermoelectric current produced the heat was steadily increased at x until at last the tin and platina combined there an effect which is known to take place with strong chemical action and high ignition but not the slightest additional effect occurred at the galvanometer no other deflection than that due to the thermoelectric current was observable the whole time hence though a conductor and one capable of exerting chemical action on the tin was used yet not being an electrolyte not the slightest effect of an electrical current could be observed 947  923 from this it seems apparent that the peculiar character and condition of an electrolyte is essential in one part of the voltaic circuit and its nature being considered good reasons appear why it and it alone should be effectual an electrolyte is always a compound body it can conduct but only whilst decomposing its conduction depends upon its decomposition and the transmission of its particles in directions parallel to the current and so intimate is this connexion that if their transition be stopped the current is stopped also if their course be changed its course and direction change with them if they proceed in one direction it has no power to proceed in any other than a direction invariably dependent on them the particles of an electrolytic body are all so mutually connected are in such relation with each other through their whole extent in the direction of the current that if the last is not disposed of the first is not at liberty to take up its place in the new combination which the powerful affinity of the most active metal tends to produce and then the current itself is stopped for the dependencies of the current and the decomposition are so mutual that whichsoever be originally determined ie the motion of the particles or the motion of the current the other is invariable in its concomitant production and its relation to it  924 consider then water as an electrolyte and also as an oxidizing body the attraction of the zinc for the oxygen is greater under the circumstances than that of the oxygen for the hydrogen but in combining with it it tends to throw into circulation a current of electricity in a certain direction this direction is consistent as is found by innumerable experiments with the transfer of the hydrogen from the zinc towards the platina and the transfer in the opposite direction of fresh oxygen from the platina towards the zinc so that the current can pass in that one line and whilst it passes can consist with and favour the renewal of the conditions upon the surface of the zinc which at first determined both the combination and circulation hence the continuance of the action there and the continuation of the current it therefore appears quite as essential that there should be an electrolyte in the circuit in order that the action may be transferred forward in a certain constant direction as that there should be an oxidizing or other body capable of acting directly on the metal and it also appears to be essential that these two should merge into one or that the principle directly active on the metal by chemical action should be one of the ions of the electrolyte used whether the voltaic arrangement be excited by solution of acids or alkalies or sulphurets or by fused substances 476 this principle has always hitherto as far as i am aware been an anion 943 and i anticipate from a consideration of the principles of electric action that it must of necessity be one of that class of bodies  925 if the action of the sulphuric acid used in the voltaic circuit be considered it will be found incompetent to produce any sensible portion of the electricity of the current by its combination with the oxide formed for this simple reason it is deficient in a most essential condition it forms no part of an electrolyte nor is it in relation with any other body present in the solution which will permit of the mutual transfer of the particles and the consequent transfer of the electricity it is true that as the plane at which the acid is dissolving the oxide of zinc formed by the action of the water is in contact with the metal zinc there seems no difficulty in considering how the oxide there could communicate an electrical state proportionate to its own chemical action on the acid to the metal which is a conductor without decomposition but on the side of the acid there is no substance to complete the circuit the water as water cannot conduct it or at least only so small a proportion that it is merely an incidental and almost inappreciable effect 970 and it cannot conduct it as an electrolyte because an electrolyte conducts in consequence of the mutual relation and action of its particles and neither of the elements of the water nor even the water itself as far as we can perceive are ions with respect to the sulphuric acid 848a    a it will be seen that i here agree with sir humphry davy who has   experimentally supported the opinion that acids and alkalies in   combining do not produce any current of electricity philosophical   transactions 1826 p 398  926 this view of the secondary character of the sulphuric acid as an agent in the production of the voltaic current is further confirmed by the fact that the current generated and transmitted is directly and exactly proportional to the quantity of water decomposed and the quantity of zinc oxidized 868 991 and is the same as that required to decompose the same quantity of water as therefore the decomposition of the water shows that the electricity has passed by its means there remains no other electricity to be accounted for or to be referred to any action other than that of the zinc and the water on each other  927 the general case for it includes the former one 924 of acids and bases may theoretically be stated in the following manner let a fig 79 be supposed to be a dry oxacid and b a dry base in contact at c and in electric communication at their extremities by plates of platina pp and a platina wire w if this acid and base were fluid and combination took place at c with an affinity ever so vigorous and capable of originating an electric current the current could not circulate in any important degree because according to the experimental results neither a nor b could conduct without being decomposed for they are either electrolytes or else insulators under all circumstances except to very feeble and unimportant currents 970 986 now the affinities at c are not such as tend to cause the elements either of a or b to separate but only such as would make the two bodies combine together as a whole the point of action is therefore insulated the action itself local 921 947 and no current can be formed  928 if the acid and base be dissolved in water then it is possible that a small portion of the electricity due to chemical action may be conducted by the water without decomposition 966 984 but the quantity will be so small as to be utterly disproportionate to that due to the equivalents of chemical force will be merely incidental and as it does not involve the essential principles of the voltaic pile it forms no part of the phenomena at present under investigationa    a it will i trust be fully understood that in these investigations   i am not professing to take an account of every small incidental or   barely possible effect dependent upon slight disturbances of the   electric fluid during chemical action but am seeking to distinguish   and identify those actions on which the power of the voltaic battery   essentially depends  929 if for the oxacid a hydracid be substituted 927as one analogous to the muriatic for instancethen the state of things changes altogether and a current due to the chemical action of the acid on the base is possible but now both the bodies act as electrolytes for it is only one principle of each which combine mutuallyas for instance the chlorine with the metaland the hydrogen of the acid and the oxygen of the base are ready to traverse with the chlorine of the acid and the metal of the base in conformity with the current and according to the general principles already so fully laid down  930 this view of the oxidation of the metal or other direct chemical action upon it being the sole cause of the production of the electric current in the ordinary voltaic pile is supported by the effects which take place when alkaline or sulphuretted solutions 931 943 are used for the electrolytic conductor instead of dilute sulphuric acid it was in elucidation of this point that the experiments without metallic contact and with solution of alkali as the exciting fluid already referred to 884 were made  931 advantage was then taken of the more favourable condition offered when metallic contact is allowed 895 and the experiments upon the decomposition of bodies by a single pair of plates 899 were repeated solution of caustic potassa being employed in the vessel v fig 77 in place of dilute sulphuric acid all the effects occurred as before the galvanometer was deflected the decompositions of the solutions of iodide of potassium nitrate of silver muriatic acid and sulphate of soda ensued at x and the places where the evolved principles appeared as well as the deflection of the galvanometer indicated a current in the same direction as when acid was in the vessel v ie from the zinc through the solution to the platina and back by the galvanometer and substance suffering decomposition to the zinc  932 the similarity in the action of either dilute sulphuric acid or potassa goes indeed far beyond this even to the proof of identity in quantity as well as in direction of the electricity produced if a plate of amalgamated zinc be put into a solution of potassa it is not sensibly acted upon but if touched in the solution by a plate of platina hydrogen is evolved on the surface of the latter metal and the zinc is oxidized exactly as when immersed in dilute sulphuric acid 863 i accordingly repeated the experiment before described with weighed plates of zinc 864 c using however solution of potassa instead of dilute sulphuric acid although the time required was much longer than when acid was used amounting to three hours for the oxidizement of 755 grains of zinc still i found that the hydrogen evolved at the platina plate was the equivalent of the metal oxidized at the surface of the zinc hence the whole of the reasoning which was applicable in the former instance applies also here the current being in the same direction and its decomposing effect in the same degree as if acid instead of alkali had been used 868  933 the proof therefore appears to me complete that the combination of the acid with the oxide in the former experiment had nothing to do with the production of the electric current for the same current is here produced when the action of the acid is absent and the reverse action of an alkali is present i think it cannot be supposed for a moment that the alkali acted chemically as an acid to the oxide formed on the contrary our general chemical knowledge leads to the conclusion that the ordinary metallic oxides act rather as acids to the alkalies yet that kind of action would tend to give a reverse current in the present case if any were due to the union of the oxide of the exciting metal with the body which combines with it but instead of any variation of this sort the direction of the electricity was constant and its quantity also directly proportional to the water decomposed or the zinc oxidized there are reasons for believing that acids and alkalies when in contact with metals upon which they cannot act directly still have a power of influencing their attractions for oxygen 941 but all the effects in these experiments prove i think that it is the oxidation of the metal necessarily dependent upon and associated as it is with the electrolyzation of the water 921 923 that produces the current and that the acid or alkali merely acts as solvents and by removing the oxidized zinc allows other portions to decompose fresh water and so continues the evolution or determination of the current  934 the experiments were then varied by using solution of ammonia instead of solution of potassa and as it when pure is like water a bad conductor 554 it was occasionally improved in that power by adding sulphate of ammonia to it but in all the cases the results were the same as before decompositions of the same kind were effected and the electric current producing these was in the same direction as in the experiments just described  935 in order to put the equal and similar action of acid and alkali to stronger proof arrangements were made as in fig 80 the glass vessel a contained dilute sulphuric acid the corresponding glass vessel b solution of potassa pp was a plate of platina dipping into both solutions and zz two plates of amalgamated zinc connected with a delicate galvanometer when these were plunged at the same time into the two vessels there was generally a first feeble effect and that in favour of the alkali ie the electric current tended to pass through the vessels in the direction of the arrow being the reverse direction of that which the acid in a would have produced alone but the effect instantly ceased and the action of the plates in the vessels was so equal that being contrary because of the contrary position of the plates no permanent current resulted  936 occasionally a zinc plate was substituted for the plate pp and platina plates for the plates zz but this caused no difference in the results nor did a further change of the middle plate to copper produce any alteration  937 as the opposition of electromotive pairs of plates produces results other than those due to the mere difference of their independent actions 1011 1045 i devised another form of apparatus in which the action of acid and alkali might be more directly compared a cylindrical glass cup about two inches deep within an inch in internal diameter and at least a quarter of an inch in thickness was cut down the middle into halves fig 81 a broad brass ring larger in diameter than the cup was supplied with a screw at one side so that when the two halves of the cup were within the ring and the screw was made to press tightly against the glass the cup held any fluid put into it bibulous paper of different degrees of permeability was then cut into pieces of such a size as to be easily introduced between the loosened halves of the cup and served when the latter were tightened again to form a porous division down the middle of the cup sufficient to keep any two fluids on opposite sides of the paper from mingling except very slowly and yet allowing them to act freely as one electrolyte the two spaces thus produced i will call the cells a and b fig 82 this instrument i have found of most general application in the investigation of the relation of fluids and metals amongst themselves and to each other by combining its use with that of the galvanometer it is easy to ascertain the relation of one metal with two fluids or of two metals with one fluid or of two metals and two fluids upon each other  938 dilute sulphuric acid sp gr 125 was put into the cell a and a strong solution of caustic potassa into the cell b they mingled slowly through the paper and at last a thick crust of sulphate of potassa formed on the side of the paper next to the alkali a plate of clean platina was put into each cell and connected with a delicate galvanometer but no electric current could be observed hence the contact of acid with one platina plate and alkali with the other was unable to produce a current nor was the combination of the acid with the alkali more effectual 925  939 when one of the platina plates was removed and a zinc plate substituted either amalgamated or not a strong electric current was produced but whether the zinc were in the acid whilst the platina was in the alkali or whether the reverse order were chosen the electric current was always from the zinc through the electrolyte to the platina and back through the galvanometer to the zinc the current seeming to be strongest when the zinc was in the alkali and the platina in the acid  940 in these experiments therefore the acid seems to have no power over the alkali but to be rather inferior to it in force hence there is no reason to suppose that the combination of the oxide formed with the acid around it has any direct influence in producing the electricity evolved the whole of which appears to be due to the oxidation of the metal 919  941 the alkali in fact is superior to the acid in bringing a metal into what is called the positive state for if plates of the same metal as zinc tin lead or copper be used both in the acid or alkali the electric current is from the alkali across the cell to the acid and back through the galvanometer to the alkali as sir humphry davy formerly stated a this current is so powerful that if amalgamated zinc or tin or lead be used the metal in the acid evolves hydrogen the moment it is placed in communication with that in the alkali not from any direct action of the acid upon it for if the contact be broken the action ceases but because it is powerfully negative with regard to the metal in the alkali    a elements of chemical philosophy p 149 or philosophical   transactions 1826 p 403  942 the superiority of alkali is further proved by this that if zinc and tin be used or tin and lead whichsoever metal is put into the alkali becomes positive that in the acid being negative whichsoever is in the alkali is oxidized whilst that in the acid remains in the metallic state as far as the electric current is concerned  943 when sulphuretted solutions are used 930 in illustration of the assertion that it is the chemical action of the metal and one of the ions of the associated electrolyte that produces all the electricity of the voltaic circuit the proofs are still the same thus as sir humphry davya has shown if iron and copper be plunged into dilute acid the current is from the iron through the liquid to the copper in solution of potassa it is in the same direction but in solution of sulphuret of potassa it is reversed in the two first cases it is oxygen which combines with the iron in the latter sulphur which combines with the copper that produces the electric current but both of these are ions existing as such in the electrolyte which is at the same moment suffering decomposition and what is more both of these are anions for they leave the electrolytes at their anodes and act just as chlorine iodine or any other anion would act which might have been previously chosen as that which should be used to throw the voltaic circle into activity    a elements of chemical philosophy p 148  944 the following experiments complete the series of proofs of the origin of the electricity in the voltaic pile a fluid amalgam of potassium containing not more than a hundredth of that metal was put into pure water and connected through the galvanometer with a plate of platina in the same water there was immediately an electric current from the amalgam through the electrolyte to the platina this must have been due to the oxidation only of the metal for there was neither acid nor alkali to combine with or in any way act on the body produced  945 again a plate of clean lead and a plate of platina were put into pure water there was immediately a powerful current produced from the lead through the fluid to the platina it was even intense enough to decompose solution of the iodide of potassium when introduced into the circuit in the form of apparatus already described 880 fig 73 here no action of acid or alkali on the oxide formed from the lead could supply the electricity it was due solely to the oxidation of the metal                                       946 there is no point in electrical science which seems to me of more importance than the state of the metals and the electrolytic conductor in a simple voltaic circuit before and at the moment when metallic contact is first completed if clearly understood i feel no doubt it would supply us with a direct key to the laws under which the great variety of voltaic excitements direct and incidental occur and open out new fields of research for our investigationa    a in connexion with this part of the subject refer now to series xi   1164 series xii 13431358 and series xiii 1621 cdec 1838  947 we seem to have the power of deciding to a certain extent in numerous cases of chemical affinity as of zinc with the oxygen of water c c which of two modes of action of the attractive power shall be exerted 996 in the one mode we can transfer the power onwards and make it produce elsewhere its equivalent of action 867 917 in the other it is not transferred but exerted wholly at the spot the first is the case of voltaelectric excitation the other ordinary chemical affinity but both are chemical actions and due to one force or principle  948 the general circumstances of the former mode occur in all instances of voltaic currents but may be considered as in their perfect condition and then free from those of the second mode in some only of the cases as in those of plates of zinc and platina in solution of potassa or of amalgamated zinc and platina in dilute sulphuric acid  949 assuming it sufficiently proved by the preceding experiments and considerations that the electromotive action depends when zinc platina and dilute sulphuric acid are used upon the mutual affinity of the metal zinc and the oxygen of the water 921 924 it would appear that the metal when alone has not power enough under the circumstances to take the oxygen and expel the hydrogen from the water for in fact no such action takes place but it would also appear that it has power so far to act by its attraction for the oxygen of the particles in contact with it as to place the similar forces already active between these and the other particles of oxygen and the particles of hydrogen in the water in a peculiar state of tension or polarity and probably also at the same time to throw those of its own particles which are in contact with the water into a similar but opposed state whilst this state is retained no further change occurs but when it is relieved by completion of the circuit in which case the forces determined in opposite directions with respect to the zinc and the electrolyte are found exactly competent to neutralize each other then a series of decompositions and recompositions takes place amongst the particles of oxygen and hydrogen constituting the water between the place of contact with the platina and the place where the zinc is active these intervening particles being evidently in close dependence upon and relation to each other the zinc forms a direct compound with those particles of oxygen which were previously in divided relation to both it and the hydrogen the oxide is removed by the acid and a fresh surface of zinc is presented to the water to renew and repeat the action  950 practically the state of tension is best relieved by dipping a metal which has less attraction for oxygen than the zinc into the dilute acid and making it also touch the zinc the force of chemical affinity which has been influenced or polarized in the particles of the water by the dominant attraction of the zinc for the oxygen is then transferred in a most extraordinary manner through the two metals so as to reenter upon the circuit in the electrolytic conductor which unlike the metals in that respect cannot convey or transfer it without suffering decomposition or rather probably it is exactly balanced and neutralized by the force which at the same moment completes the combination of the zinc with the oxygen of the water the forces in fact of the two particles which are acting towards each other and which are therefore in opposite directions are the origin of the two opposite forces or directions of force in the current they are of necessity equivalent to each other being transferred forward in contrary directions they produce what is called the voltaic current and it seems to me impossible to resist the idea that it must be preceded by a state of tension in the fluid and between the fluid and the zinc the first consequence of the affinity of the zinc for the oxygen of the water  951 i have sought carefully for indications of a state of tension in the electrolytic conductor and conceiving that it might produce something like structure either before or during its discharge i endeavoured to make this evident by polarized light a glass cell seven inches long one inch and a half wide and six inches deep had two sets of platina electrodes adapted to it one set for the ends and the other for the sides those for the sides were seven inches long by three inches high and when in the cell were separated by a little frame of wood covered with calico so that when made active by connexion with a battery upon any solution in the cell the bubbles of gas rising from them did not obscure the central parts of the liquid  952 a saturated solution of sulphate of soda was put into the cell and the electrodes connected with a battery of 150 pairs of 4inch plates the current of electricity was conducted across the cell so freely that the discharge was as good as if a wire had been used a ray of polarized light was then transmitted through this solution directly across the course of the electric current and examined by an analysing plate but though it penetrated seven inches of solution thus subject to the action of the electricity and though contact was sometimes made sometimes broken and occasionally reversed during the observations not the slightest trace of action on the ray could be perceived  953 the large electrodes were then removed and others introduced which fitted the ends of the cell in each a slit was cut so as to allow the light to pass the course of the polarized ray was now parallel to the current or in the direction of its axis 517 but still no effect under any circumstances of contact or disunion could be perceived upon it  954 a strong solution of nitrate of lead was employed instead of the sulphate of soda but no effects could be detected  955 thinking it possible that the discharge of the electric forces by the successive decompositions and recompositions of the particles of the electrolyte might neutralize and therefore destroy any effect which the first state of tension could by possibility produce i took a substance which being an excellent electrolyte when fluid was a perfect insulator when solid namely borate of lead in the form of a glass plate and connecting the sides and the edges of this mass with the metallic plates sometimes in contact with the poles of a voltaic battery and sometimes even with the electric machine for the advantage of the much higher intensity then obtained i passed a polarized ray across it in various directions as before but could not obtain the slightest appearance of action upon the light hence i conclude that notwithstanding the new and extraordinary state which must be assumed by an electrolyte either during decomposition when a most enormous quantity of electricity must be traversing it or in the state of tension which is assumed as preceding decomposition and which might be supposed to be retained in the solid form of the electrolyte still it has no power of affecting a polarized ray of light for no kind of structure or tension can in this way be rendered evident  956 there is however one beautiful experimental proof of a state of tension acquired by the metals and the electrolyte before the electric current is produced and before contact of the different metals is made 915 in fact at that moment when chemical forces only are efficient as a cause of action i took a voltaic apparatus consisting of a single pair of large plates namely a cylinder of amalgamated zinc and a double cylinder of copper these were put into a jar containing dilute sulphuric acida and could at pleasure be placed in metallic communication by a copper wire adjusted so as to dip at the extremities into two cups of mercury connected with the two plates    a when nitrosulphuric acid is used the spark is more powerful but   local chemical action can then commence and proceed without requiring   metallic contact  957 being thus arranged there was no chemical action whilst the plates were not connected on making the connexion a spark was obtaineda and the solution was immediately decomposed on breaking it the usual spark was obtained and the decomposition ceased in this case it is evident that the first spark must have occurred before metallic contact was made for it passed through an interval of air and also that it must have tended to pass before the electrolytic action began for the latter could not take place until the current passed and the current could not pass before the spark appeared hence i think there is sufficient proof that as it is the zinc and water which by their mutual action produce the electricity of this apparatus so these by their first contact with each other were placed in a state of powerful tension 951 which though it could not produce the actual decomposition of the water was able to make a spark of electricity pass between the zinc and a fit discharger as soon as the interval was rendered sufficiently small the experiment demonstrates the direct production of the electric spark from pure chemical forces    a it has been universally supposed that no spark is produced on   making the contact between a single pair of plates i was led to   expect one from the considerations already advanced in this paper the   wire of communication should be short for with a long wire   circumstances strongly affecting the spark are introduced  958 there are a few circumstances connected with the production of this spark by a single pair of plates which should be known to ensure success to the experimentb when the amalgamated surfaces of contact are quite clean and dry the spark on making contact is quite as brilliant as on breaking it if not even more so when a film of oxide or dirt was present at either mercurial surface then the first spark was often feeble and often failed the breaking spark however continuing very constant and bright when a little water was put over the mercury the spark was greatly diminished in brilliancy but very regular both on making and breaking contact when the contact was made between clean platina the spark was also very small but regular both ways the true electric spark is in fact very small and when surfaces of mercury are used it is the combustion of the metal which produces the greater part of the light the circumstances connected with the burning of the mercury are most favourable on breaking contact for the act of separation exposes clean surfaces of metal whereas on making contact a thin film of oxide or soiling matter often interferes hence the origin of the general opinion that it is only when the contact is broken that the spark passes    b see in relation to precautions respecting a spark 1074dec   1838  959 with reference to the other set of cases namely those of local action 947 in which chemical affinity being exerted causes no transference of the power to a distance where no electric current is produced it is evident that forces of the most intense kind must be active and in some way balanced in their activity during such combinations these forces being directed so immediately and exclusively towards each other that no signs of the powerful electric current they can produce become apparent although the same final state of things is obtained as if that current had passed it was berzelius i believe who considered the heat and light evolved in cases of combustion as the consequences of this mode of exertion of the electric powers of the combining particles but it will require a much more exact and extensive knowledge of the nature of electricity and the manner in which it is associated with the atoms of matter before we can understand accurately the action of this power in thus causing their union or comprehend the nature of the great difference which it presents in the two modes of action just distinguished we may imagine but such imaginations must for the time be classed with the great mass of doubtful knowledge 876 which we ought rather to strive to diminish than to increase for the very extensive contradictions of this knowledge by itself shows that but a small portion of it can ultimately prove truea    a refer to 1738 c series xivdec 1838  960 of the two modes of action in which chemical affinity is exerted it is important to remark that that which produces the electric current is as definite as that which causes ordinary chemical combination so that in examining the production or evolution of electricity in cases of combination or decomposition it will be necessary not merely to observe certain effects dependent upon a current of electricity but also their quantity and though it may often happen that the forces concerned in any particular case of chemical action may be partly exerted in one mode and partly in the other it is only those which are efficient in producing the current that have any relation to voltaic action thus in the combination of oxygen and hydrogen to produce water electric powers to a most enormous amount are for the time active 861 873 but any mode of examining the flame which they form during energetic combination which has as yet been devised has given but the feeblest traces these therefore may not cannot be taken as evidences of the nature of the action but are merely incidental results incomparably small in relation to the forces concerned and supplying no information of the way in which the particles are active on each other or in which their forces are finally arranged  961 that such cases of chemical action produce no current of electricity is perfectly consistent with what we know of the voltaic apparatus in which it is essential that one of the combining elements shall form part of or be in direct relation with an electrolytic conductor 921 923 that such cases produce no free electricity of tension and that when they are converted into cases of voltaic action they produce a current in which the opposite forces are so equal as to neutralize each other prove the equality of the forces in the opposed acting particles of matter and therefore the equality of electric power in those quantities of matter which are called electrochemical equivalents 824 hence another proof of the definite nature of electrochemical action 783 c and that chemical affinity and electricity are forms of the same power 917 c  962 the direct reference of the effects produced by the voltaic pile at the place of experimental decomposition to the chemical affinities active at the place of excitation 891 917 gives a very simple and natural view of the cause why the bodies or ions evolved pass in certain directions for it is only when they pass in those directions that their forces can consist with and compensate in direction at least the superior forces which are dominant at the place where the action of the whole is determined if for instance in a voltaic circuit the activity of which is determined by the attraction of zinc for the oxygen of water the zinc move from right to left then any other cation included in the circuit being part of an electrolyte or forming part of it at the moment will also move from right to left and as the oxygen of the water by its natural affinity for the zinc moves from left to right so any other body of the same class with it ie any other anion under its government for the time will move from left to right  963 this i may illustrate by reference to fig 83 the double circle of which may represent a complete voltaic circuit the direction of its forces being determined by supposing for a moment the zinc b and the platina c as representing plates of those metals acting upon water d e and other substances but having their energy exalted so as to effect several decompositions by the use of a battery at a 989 this supposition may be allowed because the action in the battery will only consist of repetitions of what would take place between b and c if they really constituted but a single pair the zinc b and the oxygen d by their mutual affinity tend to unite but as the oxygen is already in association with the hydrogen e and has its inherent chemical or electric powers neutralized for the time by those of the latter the hydrogen e must leave the oxygen d and advance in the direction of the arrow head or else the zinc b cannot move in the same direction to unite to the oxygen d nor the oxygen d move in the contrary direction to unite to the zinc b the relation of the similar forces of b and c in contrary directions to the opposite forces of d being the preventive as the hydrogen e advances it on coming against the platina c f which forms a part of the circuit communicates its electric or chemical forces through it to the next electrolyte in the circuit fused chloride of lead g h where the chlorine must move in conformity with the direction of the oxygen at d for it has to compensate the forces disturbed in its part of the circuit by the superior influence of those between the oxygen and zinc at d b aided as they are by those of the battery a and for a similar reason the lead must move in the direction pointed out by the arrow head that it may be in right relation to the first moving body of its own class namely the zinc b if copper intervene in the circuit from i to k it acts as the platina did before and if another electrolyte as the iodide of tin occur at l m then the iodine l being an anion must move in conformity with the exciting anion namely the oxygen d and the cation tin m move in correspondence with the other cations b e and h that the chemical forces may be in equilibrium as to their direction and quantity throughout the circuit should it so happen that the anions in their circulation can combine with the metals at the anodes of the respective electrolytes as would be the case at the platina f and the copper k then those bodies becoming parts of electrolytes under the influence of the current immediately travel but considering their relation to the zinc b it is evidently impossible that they can travel in any other direction than what will accord with its course and therefore can never tend to pass otherwise than from the anode and to the cathode  964 in such a circle as that delineated therefore all the known anions may be grouped within and all the cations without if any number of them enter as ions into the constitution of electrolytes and forming one circuit are simultaneously subject to one common current the anions must move in accordance with each other in one direction and the cations in the other nay more than that equivalent portions of these bodies must so advance in opposite directions for the advance of every 325 parts of the zinc b must be accompanied by a motion in the opposite direction of 8 parts of oxygen at d of 36 parts of chlorine at g of 126 parts of iodine at l and in the same direction by electrochemical equivalents of hydrogen lead copper and tin at e h k and m  965 if the present paper be accepted as a correct expression of facts it will still only prove a confirmation of certain general views put forth by sir humphry davy in his bakerian lecture for 1806a and revised and restated by him in another bakerian lecture on electrical and chemical changes for the year 1826b his general statement is that chemical and electrical attractions were produced by the same cause acting in one case on particles in the other on masses of matter and that the same property under different modifications was the cause of all the phenomena exhibited by different voltaic combinationsc this statement i believe to be true but in admitting and supporting it i must guard myself from being supposed to assent to all that is associated with it in the two papers referred to or as admitting the experiments which are there quoted as decided proofs of the truth of the principle had i thought them so there would have been no occasion for this investigation it may be supposed by some that i ought to go through these papers distinguishing what i admit from what i reject and giving good experimental or philosophical reasons for the judgment in both cases but then i should be equally bound to review for the same purpose all that has been written both for and against the necessity of metallic contactfor and against the origin of voltaic electricity in chemical actiona duty which i may not undertake in the present paperd    a philosophical transactions 1807    b ibid 1826 p 383    c ibid 1826 p 389    d i at one time intended to introduce here in the form of a note a   table of reference to the papers of the different philosophers who   have referred the origin of the electricity in the voltaic pile to   contact or to chemical action or to both but on the publication of   the first volume of m becquerels highly important and valuable   traité de lelectricité et du magnétisme i thought it far better to   refer to that work for these references and the views held by the   authors quoted see pages 86 91 104 110 112 117 118 120 151   152 224 227 228 232 233 252 255 257 258 290 cjuly 3rd   1834   ¶ ii on the intensity necessary for electrolyzation  966 it became requisite for the comprehension of many of the conditions attending voltaic action to determine positively if possible whether electrolytes could resist the action of an electric current when beneath a certain intensity whether the intensity at which the current ceased to act would be the same for all bodies and also whether the electrolytes thus resisting decomposition would conduct the electric current as a metal does after they ceased to conduct as electrolytes or would act as perfect insulators  967 it was evident from the experiments described 904 906 that different bodies were decomposed with very different facilities and apparently that they required for their decomposition currents of different intensities resisting some but giving way to others but it was needful by very careful and express experiments to determine whether a current could really pass through and yet not decompose an electrolyte 910  968 an arrangement fig 84 was made in which two glass vessels contained the same dilute sulphuric acid sp gr 125 the plate z was amalgamated zinc in connexion by a platina wire a with the platina plate e b was a platina wire connecting the two platina plates pp c was a platina wire connected with the platina plate p on the plate e was placed a piece of paper moistened in solution of iodide of potassium the wire c was so curved that its end could be made to rest at pleasure on this paper and show by the evolution of iodine there whether a current was passing or being placed in the dotted position it formed a direct communication with the platina plate e and the electricity could pass without causing decomposition the object was to produce a current by the action of the acid on the amalgamated zinc in the first vessel a to pass it through the acid in the second vessel b by platina electrodes that its power of decomposing water might if existing be observed and to verify the existence of the current at pleasure by decomposition at e without involving the continual obstruction to the current which would arise from making the decomposition there constant the experiment being arranged was examined and the existence of a current ascertained by the decomposition at e the whole was then left with the end of the wire c resting on the plate e so as to form a constant metallic communication there  969 after several hours the end of the wire c was replaced on the testpaper at e decomposition occurred and the proof of a passing current was therefore complete the current was very feeble compared to what it had been at the beginning of the experiment because of a peculiar state acquired by the metal surfaces in the second vessel which caused them to oppose the passing current by a force which they possess under these circumstances 1040 still it was proved by the decomposition that this state of the plates in the second vessel was not able entirely to stop the current determined in the first and that was all that was needful to be ascertained in the present inquiry  970 this apparatus was examined from time to time and an electric current always found circulating through it until twelve days had elapsed during which the water in the second vessel had been constantly subject to its action notwithstanding this lengthened period not the slightest appearance of a bubble upon either of the plates in that vessel occurred from the results of the experiment i conclude that a current had passed but of so low an intensity as to fall beneath that degree at which the elements of water unaided by any secondary force resulting from the capability of combination with the matter of the electrodes or of the liquid surrounding them separated from each other  971 it may be supposed that the oxygen and hydrogen had been evolved in such small quantities as to have entirely dissolved in the water and finally to have escaped at the surface or to have reunited into water that the hydrogen can be so dissolved was shown in the first vessel for after several days minute bubbles of gas gradually appeared upon a glass rod inserted to retain the zinc and platina apart and also upon the platina plate itself and these were hydrogen they resulted principally in this waynotwithstanding the amalgamation of the zinc the acid exerted a little direct action upon it so that a small stream of hydrogen bubbles was continually rising from its surface a little of this hydrogen gradually dissolved in the dilute acid and was in part set free against the surfaces of the rod and the plate according to the wellknown action of such solid bodies in solutions of gases 623 c  972 but if the gases had been evolved in the second vessel by the decomposition of water and had tended to dissolve still there would have been every reason to expect that a few bubbles should have appeared on the electrodes especially on the negative one if it were only because of its action as a nucleus on the solution supposed to be formed but none appeared even after twelve days  973 when a few drops only of nitric acid were added to the vessel a fig 84 then the results were altogether different in less than five minutes bubbles of gas appeared on the plates p and p in the second vessel to prove that this was the effect of the electric current which by trial at c was found at the same time to be passing the connexion at c was broken the plates pp cleared from bubbles and left in the acid of the vessel b for fifteen minutes during that time no bubbles appeared upon them but on restoring the communication at c a minute did not elapse before gas appeared in bubbles upon the plates the proof therefore is most full and complete that the current excited by dilute sulphuric acid with a little nitric acid in vessel a has intensity enough to overcome the chemical affinity exerted between the oxygen and hydrogen of the water in the vessel b whilst that excited by dilute sulphuric acid alone has not sufficient intensity  974 on using a strong solution of caustic potassa in the vessel a to excite the current it was found by the decomposing effects at e that the current passed but it had not intensity enough to decompose the water in the vessel b for though left for fourteen days during the whole of which time the current was found to be passing still not the slightest appearance of gas appeared on the plates pp nor any other signs of the water having suffered decomposition  975 sulphate of soda in solution was then experimented with for the purpose of ascertaining with respect to it whether a certain electrolytic intensity was also required for its decomposition in this state in analogy with the result established with regard to water 974 the apparatus was arranged as in fig 85 p and z are the platina and zinc plates dipping into a solution of common salt a and b are platina plates connected by wires of platina except in the galvanometer g with p and z c is a connecting wire of platina the ends of which can be made to rest either on the plates a b or on the papers moistened in solutions which are placed upon them so that the passage of the current without decomposition or with one or two decompositions was under ready command as far as arrangement was concerned in order to change the anodes and cathodes at the places of decomposition the form of apparatus fig 86 was occasionally adopted here only one platina plate c was used both pieces of paper on which decomposition was to be effected were placed upon it the wires from p and z resting upon these pieces of paper or upon the plate c according as the current with or without decomposition of the solutions was required  976 on placing solution of iodide of potassium in paper at one of the decomposing localities and solution of sulphate of soda at the other so that the electric current should pass through both at once the solution of iodide was slowly decomposed yielding iodine at the anode and alkali at the cathode but the solution of sulphate of soda exhibited no signs of decomposition neither acid nor alkali being evolved from it on placing the wires so that the iodide alone was subject to the action of the current 900 it was quickly and powerfully decomposed but on arranging them so that the sulphate of soda alone was subject to action it still refused to yield up its elements finally the apparatus was so arranged under a wet bellglass that it could be left for twelve hours the current passing during the whole time through a solution of sulphate of soda retained in its place by only two thicknesses of bibulous litmus and turmeric paper at the end of that time it was ascertained by the decomposition of iodide of potassium at the second place of action that the current was passing and had passed for the twelve hours and yet no trace of acid or alkali from the sulphate of soda appeared  977 from these experiments it may i think be concluded that a solution of sulphate of soda can conduct a current of electricity which is unable to decompose the neutral salt present that this salt in the state of solution like water requires a certain electrolytic intensity for its decomposition and that the necessary intensity is much higher for this substance than for the iodide of potassium in a similar state of solution  978 i then experimented on bodies rendered decomposable by fusion and first on chloride of lead the current was excited by dilute sulphuric acid without any nitric acid between zinc and platina plates fig 87 and was then made to traverse a little chloride of lead fused upon glass at a a paper moistened in solution of iodide of potassium at b and a galvanometer at g the metallic terminations at a and b were of platina being thus arranged the decomposition at b and the deflection at g showed that an electric current was passing but there was no appearance of decomposition at a not even after a metallic communication at b was established the experiment was repeated several times and i am led to conclude that in this case the current has not intensity sufficient to cause the decomposition of the chloride of lead and further that like water 974 fused chloride of lead can conduct an electric current having an intensity below that required to effect decomposition  979 chloride of silver was then placed at a fig 87 instead of chloride of lead there was a very ready decomposition of the solution of iodide of potassium at b and when metallic contact was made there very considerable deflection of the galvanometer needle at g platina also appeared to be dissolved at the anode of the fused chloride at a and there was every appearance of a decomposition having been effected there  980 a further proof of decomposition was obtained in the following manner the platina wires in the fused chloride at a were brought very near together metallic contact having been established at b and left so the deflection at the galvanometer indicated the passage of a current feeble in its force but constant after a minute or two however the needle would suddenly be violently affected and indicate a current as strong as if metallic contact had taken place at a this i actually found to be the case for the silver reduced by the action of the current crystallized in long delicate spiculæ and these at last completed the metallic communication and at the same time that they transmitted a more powerful current than the fused chloride they proved that electrochemical decomposition of that chloride had been going on hence it appears that the current excited by dilute sulphuric acid between zinc and platina has an intensity above that required to electrolyze the fused chloride of silver when placed between platina electrodes although it has not intensity enough to decompose chloride of lead under the same circumstances  981 a drop of water placed at a instead of the fused chlorides showed as in the former case 970 that it could conduct a current unable to decompose it for decomposition of the solution of iodide at b occurred after some time but its conducting power was much below that of the fused chloride of lead 978  982 fused nitre at a conducted much better than water i was unable to decide with certainty whether it was electrolyzed but i incline to think not for there was no discoloration against the platina at the cathode if sulphonitric acid had been used in the exciting vessel both the nitre and the chloride of lead would have suffered decomposition like the water 906  983 the results thus obtained of conduction without decomposition and the necessity of a certain electrolytic intensity for the separation of the ions of different electrolytes are immediately connected with the experiments and results given in § 10 of the fourth series of these researches 418 423 444 419 but it will require a more exact knowledge of the nature of intensity both as regards the first origin of the electric current and also the manner in which it may be reduced or lowered by the intervention of longer or shorter portions of bad conductors whether decomposable or not before their relation can be minutely and fully understood  984 in the case of water the experiments i have as yet made appear to show that when the electric current is reduced in intensity below the point required for decomposition then the degree of conduction is the same whether sulphuric acid or any other of the many bodies which can affect its transferring power as an electrolyte are present or not or in other words that the necessary electrolytic intensity for water is the same whether it be pure or rendered a better conductor by the addition of these substances and that for currents of less intensity than this the water whether pure or acidulated has equal conducting power an apparatus fig 84 was arranged with dilute sulphuric acid in the vessel a and pure distilled water in the vessel b by the decomposition at c it appeared as if water was a better conductor than dilute sulphuric acid for a current of such low intensity as to cause no decomposition i am inclined however to attribute this apparent superiority of water to variations in that peculiar condition of the platina electrodes which is referred to further on in this series 1040 and which is assumed as far as i can judge to a greater degree in dilute sulphuric acid than in pure water the power therefore of acids alkalies salts and other bodies in solution to increase conducting power appears to hold good only in those cases where the electrolyte subject to the current suffers decomposition and loses all influence when the current transmitted has too low an intensity to affect chemical change it is probable that the ordinary conducting power of an electrolyte in the solid state 419 is the same as that which it possesses in the fluid state for currents the tension of which is beneath the due electrolytic intensity  985 currents of electricity produced by less than eight or ten series of voltaic elements can be reduced to that intensity at which water can conduct them without suffering decomposition by causing them to pass through three or four vessels in which water shall be successively interposed between platina surfaces the principles of interference upon which this effect depends will be described hereafter 1009 1018 but the effect may be useful in obtaining currents of standard intensity and is probably applicable to batteries of any number of pairs of plates  986 as there appears every reason to expect that all electrolytes will be found subject to the law which requires an electric current of a certain intensity for their decomposition but that they will differ from each other in the degree of intensity required it will be desirable hereafter to arrange them in a table in the order of their electrolytic intensities investigations on this point must however be very much extended and include many more bodies than have been here mentioned before such a table can be constructed it will be especially needful in such experiments to describe the nature of the electrodes used or if possible to select such as like platina or plumbago in certain cases shall have no power of assisting the separation of the ions to be evolved 913  987 of the two modes in which bodies can transmit the electric forces namely that which is so characteristically exhibited by the metals and usually called conduction and that in which it is accompanied by decomposition the first appears common to all bodies although it occurs with almost infinite degrees of difference the second is at present distinctive of the electrolytes it is however just possible that it may hereafter be extended to the metals for their power of conducting without decomposition may perhaps justly be ascribed to their requiring a very high electrolytic intensity for their decomposition  98712 the establishment of the principle that a certain electrolytic intensity is necessary before decomposition can be effected is of great importance to all those considerations which arise regarding the probable effects of weak currents such for instance as those produced by natural thermoelectricity or natural voltaic arrangements in the earth for to produce an effect of decomposition or of combination a current must not only exist but have a certain intensity before it can overcome the quiescent affinities opposed to it otherwise it will be conducted producing no permanent chemical effects on the other hand the principles are also now evident by which an opposing action can be so weakened by the juxtaposition of bodies not having quite affinity enough to cause direct action between them 913 that a very weak current shall be able to raise the sum of actions sufficiently high and cause chemical changes to occur  988 in concluding this division on the intensity necessary for electrolyzation i cannot resist pointing out the following remarkable conclusion in relation to intensity generally it would appear that when a voltaic current is produced having a certain intensity dependent upon the strength of the chemical affinities by which that current is excited 916 it can decompose a particular electrolyte without relation to the quantity of electricity passed the intensity deciding whether the electrolyte shall give way or not if that conclusion be confirmed then we may arrange circumstances so that the same quantity of electricity may pass in the same time in at the same surface into the same decomposing body in the same state and yet differing in intensity will decompose in one case and in the other notfor taking a source of too low an intensity to decompose and ascertaining the quantity passed in a given time it is easy to take another source having a sufficient intensity and reducing the quantity of electricity from it by the intervention of bad conductors to the same proportion as the former current and then all the conditions will be fulfilled which are required to produce the result described   ¶ iii on associated voltaic circles or the voltaic battery  989 passing from the consideration of single circles 875 c to their association in the voltaic battery it is a very evident consequence that if matters are so arranged that two sets of affinities in place of being opposed to each other as in figg 73 76 880 891 are made to act in conformity then instead of either interfering with the other it will rather assist it this is simply the case of two voltaic pairs of metals arranged so as to form one circuit in such arrangements the activity of the whole is known to be increased and when ten or a hundred or any larger number of such alternations are placed in conformable association with each other the power of the whole becomes proportionally exalted and we obtain that magnificent instrument of philosophic research the voltaic battery  990 but it is evident from the principles of definite action already laid down that the quantity of electricity in the current cannot be increased with the increase of the quantity of metal oxidized and dissolved at each new place of chemical action a single pair of zinc and platina plates throws as much electricity into the form of a current by the oxidation of 325 grains of the zinc 868 as would be circulated by the same alteration of a thousand times that quantity or nearly five pounds of metal oxidized at the surface of the zinc plates of a thousand pairs placed in regular battery order for it is evident that the electricity which passes across the acid from the zinc to the platina in the first cell and which has been associated with or even evolved by the decomposition of a definite portion of water in that cell cannot pass from the zinc to the platina across the acid in the second cell without the decomposition of the same quantity of water there and the oxidation of the same quantity of zinc by it 924 949 the same result recurs in every other cell the electrochemical equivalent of water must be decomposed in each before the current can pass through it for the quantity of electricity passed and the quantity of electrolyte decomposed must be the equivalents of each other the action in each cell therefore is not to increase the quantity set in motion in any one cell but to aid in urging forward that quantity the passing of which is consistent with the oxidation of its own zinc and in this way it exalts that peculiar property of the current which we endeavour to express by the term intensity without increasing the quantity beyond that which is proportionate to the quantity of zinc oxidized in any single cell of the series  991 to prove this i arranged ten pairs of amalgamated zinc and platina plates with dilute sulphuric acid in the form of a battery on completing the circuit all the pairs acted and evolved gas at the surfaces of the platina this was collected and found to be alike in quantity for each plate and the quantity of hydrogen evolved at any one platina plate was in the same proportion to the quantity of metal dissolved from any one zinc plate as was given in the experiment with a single pair 864 c it was therefore certain that just as much electricity and no more had passed through the series of ten pair of plates as had passed through or would have been put into motion by any single pair notwithstanding that ten times the quantity of zinc had been consumed  992 this truth has been proved also long ago in another way by the action of the evolved current on a magnetic needle the deflecting power of one pair of plates in a battery being equal to the deflecting power of the whole provided the wires used be sufficiently large to carry the current of the single pair freely but the cause of this equality of action could not be understood whilst the definite action and evolution of electricity 783 869 remained unknown  993 the superior decomposing power of a battery over a single pair of plates is rendered evident in two ways electrolytes held together by an affinity so strong as to resist the action of the current from a single pair yield up their elements to the current excited by many pairs and that body which is decomposed by the action of one or of few pairs of metals c is resolved into its ions the more readily as it is acted upon by electricity urged forward by many alternations  994 both these effects are i think easily understood whatever intensity may be and that must of course depend upon the nature of electricity whether it consist of a fluid or fluids or of vibrations of an ether or any other kind or condition of matter there seems to be no difficulty in comprehending that the degree of intensity at which a current of electricity is evolved by a first voltaic element shall be increased when that current is subjected to the action of a second voltaic element acting in conformity and possessing equal powers with the first and as the decompositions are merely opposed actions but exactly of the same kind as those which generate the current 917 it seems to be a natural consequence that the affinity which can resist the force of a single decomposing action may be unable to oppose the energies of many decomposing actions operating conjointly as in the voltaic battery  995 that a body which can give way to a current of feeble intensity should give way more freely to one of stronger force and yet involve no contradiction to the law of definite electrolytic action is perfectly consistent all the facts and also the theory i have ventured to put forth tend to show that the act of decomposition opposes a certain force to the passage of the electric current and that this obstruction should be overcome more or less readily in proportion to the greater or less intensity of the decomposing current is in perfect consistency with all our notions of the electric agent  996 i have elsewhere 947 distinguished the chemical action of zinc and dilute sulphuric acid into two portions that which acting effectually on the zinc evolves hydrogen at once upon its surface and that which producing an arrangement of the chemical forces throughout the electrolyte present in this case water tends to take oxygen from it but cannot do so unless the electric current consequent thereon can have free passage and the hydrogen be delivered elsewhere than against the zinc the electric current depends altogether upon the second of these but when the current can pass by favouring the electrolytic action it tends to diminish the former and increase the latter portion  997 it is evident therefore that when ordinary zinc is used in a voltaic arrangement there is an enormous waste of that power which it is the object to throw into the form of an electric current a consequence which is put in its strongest point of view when it is considered that three ounces and a half of zinc properly oxidized can circulate enough electricity to decompose nearly one ounce of water and cause the evolution of about 2100 cubic inches of hydrogen gas this loss of power not only takes place during the time the electrodes of the battery are in communication being then proportionate to the quantity of hydrogen evolved against the surface of any one of the zinc plates but includes also all the chemical action which goes on when the extremities of the pile are not in communication  998 this loss is far greater with ordinary zinc than with the pure metal as m de la rive has showna the cause is that when ordinary zinc is acted upon by dilute sulphuric acid portions of copper lead cadmium or other metals which it may contain are set free upon its surface and these being in contact with the zinc form small but very active voltaic circles which cause great destruction of the zinc and evolution of hydrogen apparently upon the zinc surface but really upon the surface of these incidental metals in the same proportion as they serve to discharge or convey the electricity back to the zinc do they diminish its power of producing an electric current which shall extend to a greater distance across the acid and be discharged only through the copper or platina plate which is associated with it for the purpose of forming a voltaic apparatus    a quarterly journal of science 1831 p 388 or bibliothèque   universelle 1830 p 391  999 all these evils are removed by the employment of an amalgam of zinc in the manner recommended by mr kempa or the use of the amalgamated zinc plates of mr sturgeon 863 who has himself suggested and objected to their application in galvanic batteries for he says were it not on account of the brittleness and other inconveniences occasioned by the incorporation of the mercury with the zinc amalgamation of the zinc surfaces in galvanic batteries would become an important improvement for the metal would last much longer and remain bright for a considerable time even for several successive hours essential considerations in the employment of this apparatusb    a jamesons edinburgh journal october 1828    b recent experimental researches p 42 c mr sturgeon is of   course unaware of the definite production of electricity by chemical   action and is in fact quoting the experiment as the strongest   argument against the chemical theory of galvanism  1000 zinc so prepared even though impure does not sensibly decompose the water of dilute sulphuric acid but still has such affinity for the oxygen that the moment a metal which like copper or platina has little or no affinity touches it in the acid action ensues and a powerful and abundant electric current is produced it is probable that the mercury acts by bringing the surface in consequence of its fluidity into one uniform condition and preventing those differences in character between one spot and another which are necessary for the formation of the minute voltaic circuits referred to 998 if any difference does exist at the first moment with regard to the proportion of zinc and mercury at one spot on the surface as compared with another that spot having the least mercury is first acted on and by solution of the zinc is soon placed in the same condition as the other parts and the whole plate rendered superficially uniform one part cannot therefore act as a discharger to another and hence all the chemical power upon the water at its surface is in that equable condition 949 which though it tends to produce an electric current through the liquid to another plate of metal which can act as a discharger 950 presents no irregularities by which any one part having weaker affinities for oxygen can act as a discharger to another two excellent and important consequences follow upon this state of the metal the first is that the full equivalent of electricity is obtained for the oxidation of a certain quantity of zinc the second that a battery constructed with the zinc so prepared and charged with dilute sulphuric acid is active only whilst the electrodes are connected and ceases to act or be acted upon by the acid the instant the communication is broken  1001 i have had a small battery of ten pairs of plates thus constructed and am convinced that arrangements of this kind will be very important especially in the development and illustration of the philosophical principles of the instrument the metals i have used are amalgamated zinc and platina connected together by being soldered to platina wires the whole apparatus having the form of the couronne des tasses the liquid used was dilute sulphuric acid of sp gr 125 no action took place upon the metals except when the electrodes were in communication and then the action upon the zinc was only in proportion to the decomposition in the experimental cell for when the current was retarded there it was retarded also in the battery and no waste of the powers of the metal was incurred  1002 in consequence of this circumstance the acid in the cells remained active for a very much longer time than usual in fact time did not tend to lower it in any sensible degree for whilst the metal was preserved to be acted upon at the proper moment the acid also was preserved almost at its first strength hence a constancy of action far beyond what can be obtained by the use of common zinc  1003 another excellent consequence was the renewal during the interval of rest between two experiments of the first and most efficient state when an amalgamated zinc and a platina plate immersed in dilute sulphuric acid are first connected the current is very powerful but instantly sinks very much in force and in some cases actually falls to only an eighth or a tenth of that first produced 1036 this is due to the acid which is in contact with the zinc becoming neutralized by the oxide formed the continued quick oxidation of the metal being thus prevented with ordinary zinc the evolution of gas at its surface tends to mingle all the liquid together and thus bring fresh acid against the metal by which the oxide formed there can be removed with the amalgamated zinc battery at every cessation of the current the saline solution against the zinc is gradually diffused amongst the rest of the liquid and upon the renewal of contact at the electrodes the zinc plates are found most favourably circumstanced for the production of a ready and powerful current  1004 it might at first be imagined that amalgamated zinc would be much inferior in force to common zinc because of the lowering of its energy which the mercury might be supposed to occasion over the whole of its surface but this is not the case when the electric currents of two pairs of platina and zinc plates were opposed the difference being that one of the zincs was amalgamated and the other not the current from the amalgamated zinc was most powerful although no gas was evolved against it and much was evolved at the surface of the unamalgamated metal again as davy has showna if amalgamated and unamalgamated zinc be put in contact and dipped into dilute sulphuric acid or other exciting fluids the former is positive to the latter ie the current passes from the amalgamated zinc through the fluid to the unprepared zinc this he accounts for by supposing that there is not any inherent and specific property in each metal which gives it the electrical character but that it depends upon its peculiar stateon that form of aggregation which fits it for chemical change    a philosophical transactions 1826 p 405  1005 the superiority of the amalgamated zinc is not however due to any such cause but is a very simple consequence of the state of the fluid in contact with it for as the unprepared zinc acts directly and alone upon the fluid whilst that which is amalgamated does not the former by the oxide it produces quickly neutralizes the acid in contact with its surface so that the progress of oxidation is retarded whilst at the surface of the amalgamated zinc any oxide formed is instantly removed by the free acid present and the clean metallic surface is always ready to act with full energy upon the water hence its superiority 1037 1006 the progress of improvement in the voltaic battery and its applications is evidently in the contrary direction at present to what it was a few years ago for in place of increasing the number of plates the strength of acid and the extent altogether of the instrument the change is rather towards its first state of simplicity but with a far more intimate knowledge and application of the principles which govern its force and action effects of decomposition can now be obtained with ten pairs of plates 417 which required five hundred or a thousand pairs for their production in the first instance the capability of decomposing fused chlorides iodides and other compounds according to the law before established 380 c and the opportunity of collecting certain of the products without any loss by the use of apparatus of the nature of those already described 789 814 c render it probable that the voltaic battery may become a useful and even economical manufacturing instrument for theory evidently indicates that an equivalent of a rare substance may be obtained at the expense of three or four equivalents of a very common body namely zinc and practice seems thus far to justify the expectation in this point of view i think it very likely that plates of platina or silver may be used instead of plates of copper with advantage and that then the evil arising occasionally from solution of the copper and its precipitation on the zinc by which the electromotive power of the zinc is so much injured will be avoided 1047   ¶ iv on the resistance of an electrolyte to electrolytic action and on interpositions  1007 i have already illustrated in the simplest possible form of experiment 891 910 the resistance established at the place of decomposition to the force active at the exciting place i purpose examining the effects of this resistance more generally but it is rather with reference to their practical interference with the action and phenomena of the voltaic battery than with any intention at this time to offer a strict and philosophical account of their nature their general and principal cause is the resistance of the chemical affinities to be overcome but there are numerous other circumstances which have a joint influence with these forces 1034 1040 c each of which would require a minute examination before a correct account of the whole could be given  1008 as it will be convenient to describe the experiments in a form different to that in which they were made both forms shall first be explained plates of platina copper zinc and other metals about three quarters of an inch wide and three inches long were associated together in pairs by means of platina wires to which they were soldered fig 88 the plates of one pair being either alike or different as might be required these were arranged in glasses fig 89 so as to form voltas crown of cups the acid or fluid in the cups never covered the whole of any plate and occasionally small glass rods were put into the cups between the plates to prevent their contact single plates were used to terminate the series and complete the connexion with a galvanometer or with a decomposing apparatus 899 968 c or both now if fig 90 be examined and compared with fig 91 the latter may be admitted as representing the former in its simplest condition for the cups i ii and iii of the former with their contents are represented by the cells i ii and iii of the latter and the metal plates z and p of the former by the similar plates represented z and p in the latter the only difference in fact between the apparatus fig 90 and the trough represented fig 91 is that twice the quantity of surface of contact between the metal and acid is allowed in the first to what would occur in the second  1009 when the extreme plates of the arrangement just described fig 90 are connected metallically through the galvanometer g then the whole represents a battery consisting of two pairs of zinc and platina plates urging a current forward which has however to decompose water unassisted by any direct chemical affinity before it can be transmitted across the cell iii and therefore before it can circulate this decomposition of water which is opposed to the passage of the current may as a matter of convenience be considered as taking place either against the surfaces of the two platina plates which constitute the electrodes in the cell in or against the two surfaces of that platina plate which separates the cells ii and iii fig 91 from each other it is evident that if that plate were away the battery would consist of two pairs of plates and two cells arranged in the most favourable position for the production of a current the platina plate therefore which being introduced as at x has oxygen evolved at one surface and hydrogen at the other that is if the decomposing current passes may be considered as the cause of any obstruction arising from the decomposition of water by the electrolytic action of the current and i have usually called it the interposed plate  1010 in order to simplify the conditions dilute sulphuric acid was first used in all the cells and platina for the interposed plates for then the initial intensity of the current which tends to be formed is constant being due to the power which zinc has of decomposing water and the opposing force of decomposition is also constant the elements of the water being unassisted in their separation at the interposed plates by any affinity or secondary action at the electrodes 744 arising either from the nature of the plate itself or the surrounding fluid  1011 when only one voltaic pair of zinc and platina plates was used the current of electricity was entirely stopped to all practical purposes by interposing one platina plate fig 92 ie by requiring of the current that it should decompose water and evolve both its elements before it should pass this consequence is in perfect accordance with the views before given 910 917 973 for as the whole result depends upon the opposition of forces at the places of electric excitement and electrodecomposition and as water is the substance to be decomposed at both before the current can move it is not to be expected that the zinc should have such powerful attraction for the oxygen as not only to be able to take it from its associated hydrogen but leave such a surplus of force as passing to the second place of decomposition should be there able to effect a second separation of the elements of water such an effect would require that the force of attraction between zinc and oxygen should under the circumstances be at least twice as great as the force of attraction between the oxygen and hydrogen  1012 when two pairs of zinc and platina exciting plates were used the current was also practically stopped by one interposed platina plate fig 93 there was a very feeble effect of a current at first but it ceased almost immediately it will be referred to with many other similar effects hereafter 1017  1013 three pairs of zinc and platina plates fig 94 were able to produce a current which could pass an interposed platina plate and effect the electrolyzation of water in cell iv the current was evident both by the continued deflection of the galvanometer and the production of bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen at the electrodes in cell iv hence the accumulated surplus force of three plates of zinc which are active in decomposing water is more than equal when added together to the force with which oxygen and hydrogen are combined in water and is sufficient to cause the separation of these elements from each other  1014 the three pairs of zinc and platina plates were now opposed by two intervening platina plates fig 95 in this case the current was stopped  1015 four pairs of zinc and platina plates were also neutralized by two interposed platina plates fig 96  1016 five pairs of zinc and platina with two interposed platina plates fig 97 gave a feeble current there was permanent deflection at the galvanometer and decomposition in the cells vi and vii but the current was very feeble very much less than when all the intermediate plates were removed and the two extreme ones only retained for when they were placed six inches asunder in one cell they gave a powerful current hence five exciting pairs with two interposed obstructing plates do not give a current at all comparable to that of a single unobstructed pair  1017 i have already said that a very feeble current passed when the series included one interposed platina and two pairs of zinc and platina plates 1012 a similarly feeble current passed in every case and even when only one exciting pair and four intervening platina plates were used fig 98 a current passed which could be detected at x both by chemical action on the solution of iodide of potassium and by the galvanometer this current i believe to be due to electricity reduced in intensity below the point requisite for the decomposition of water 970 984 for water can conduct electricity of such low intensity by the same kind of power which it possesses in common with metals and charcoal though it cannot conduct electricity of higher intensity without suffering decomposition and then opposing a new force consequent thereon with an electric current of or under this intensity it is probable that increasing the number of interposed platina plates would not involve an increased difficulty of conduction  1018 in order to obtain an idea of the additional interfering power of each added platina plate six voltaic pairs and four intervening platinas were arranged as in fig 99 a very feeble current then passed 985 1017 when one of the platinas was removed so that three intervened a current somewhat stronger passed with two intervening platinas a still stronger current passed and with only one intervening platina a very fair current was obtained but the effect of the successive plates taken in the order of their interposition was very different as might be expected for the first retarded the current more powerfully than the second and the second more than the third  1019 in these experiments both amalgamated and unamalgamated zinc were used but the results generally were the same  1020 the effects of retardation just described were altered altogether when changes were made in the nature of the liquid used between the plates either in what may be called the exciting or the retarding cells thus retaining the exciting force the same by still using pure dilute sulphuric acid for that purpose if a little nitric acid were added to the liquid in the retarding cells then the transmission of the current was very much facilitated for instance in the experiment with one pair of exciting plates and one intervening plate 1011 fig 92 when a few drops of nitric acid were added to the contents of cell ii then the current of electricity passed with considerable strength though it soon fell from other causes 1036 1040 and the same increased effect was produced by the nitric acid when many interposed plates were used  1021 this seems to be a consequence of the diminution of the difficulty of decomposing water when its hydrogen instead of being absolutely expelled as in the former cases is transferred to the oxygen of the nitric acid producing a secondary result at the cathode 752 for in accordance with the chemical views of the electric current and its action already advanced 913 the water instead of opposing a resistance to decomposition equal to the full amount of the force of mutual attraction between its oxygen and hydrogen has that force counteracted in part and therefore diminished by the attraction of the hydrogen at the cathode for the oxygen of the nitric acid which surrounds it and with which it ultimately combines instead of being evolved in its free state  1022 when a little nitric acid was put into the exciting cells then again the circumstances favouring the transmission of the current were strengthened for the intensity of the current itself was increased by the addition 906 when therefore a little nitric acid was added to both the exciting and the retarding cells the current of electricity passed with very considerable freedom  1023 when dilute muriatic acid was used it produced and transmitted a current more easily than pure dilute sulphuric acid but not so readily as dilute nitric acid as muriatic acid appears to be decomposed more freely than water 765 and as the affinity of zinc for chlorine is very powerful it might be expected to produce a current more intense than that from the use of dilute sulphuric acid and also to transmit it more freely by undergoing decomposition at a lower intensity 912  1024 in relation to the effect of these interpositions it is necessary to state that they do not appear to be at all dependent upon the size of the electrodes or their distance from each other in the acid except that when a current can pass changes in these facilitate or retard its passage for on repeating the experiment with one intervening and one pair of exciting plates 1011 fig 92 and in place of the interposed plate p using sometimes a mere wire and sometimes very large plates 1008 and also changing the terminal exciting plates z and p so that they were sometimes wires only and at others of great size still the results were the same as those already obtained  1025 in illustration of the effect of distance an experiment like that described with two exciting pairs and one intervening plate 1012 fig 93 was arranged so that the distance between the plates in the third cell could be increased to six or eight inches or diminished to the thickness of a piece of intervening bibulous paper still the result was the same in both cases the effect not being sensibly greater when the plates were merely separated by the paper than when a great way apart so that the principal opposition to the current in this case does not depend upon the quantity of intervening electrolytic conductor but on the relation of its elements to the intensity of the current or to the chemical nature of the electrodes and the surrounding fluids  1026 when the acid was sulphuric acid increasing its strength in any of the cells caused no change in the effects it did not produce a more intense current in the exciting cells 908 or cause the current produced to traverse the decomposing cells more freely but if to very weak sulphuric acid a few drops of nitric acid were added then either one or other of those effects could be produced and as might be expected in a case like this where the exciting or conducting action bore a direct reference to the acid itself increasing the strength of this the nitric acid also increased its powers  1027 the nature of the interposed plate was now varied to show its relation to the phenomena either of excitation or retardation and amalgamated zinc was first substituted for platina on employing one voltaic pair and one interposed zinc plate fig 100 there was as powerful a current apparently as if the interposed zinc plate was away hydrogen was evolved against p in cell ii and against the side of the second zinc in cell i but no gas appeared against the side of the zinc in cell ii nor against the zinc in cell i  1028 on interposing two amalgamated zinc plates fig 101 instead of one there was still a powerful current but interference had taken place on using three intermediate zinc plates fig 102 there was still further retardation though a good current of electricity passed  1029 considering the retardation as due to the inaction of the amalgamated zinc upon the dilute acid in consequence of the slight though general effect of diminished chemical power produced by the mercury on the surface and viewing this inaction as the circumstance which rendered it necessary that each plate should have its tendency to decompose water assisted slightly by the electric current it was expected that plates of the metal in the unamalgamated state would probably not require such assistance and would offer no sensible impediment to the passing of the current this expectation was fully realized in the use of two and three interposed unamalgamated plates the electric current passed through them as freely as if there had been no such plates in the way they offered no obstacle because they could decompose water without the current and the latter had only to give direction to a part of the forces which would have been active whether it had passed or not  1030 interposed plates of copper were then employed these seemed at first to occasion no obstruction but after a few minutes the current almost entirely ceased this effect appears due to the surfaces taking up that peculiar condition 1010 by which they tend to produce a reverse current for when one or more of the plates were turned round which could easily be effected with the couronne des tasses form of experiment fig 90 then the current was powerfully renewed for a few moments and then again ceased plates of platina and copper arranged as a voltaic pile with dilute sulphuric acid could not form a voltaic trough competent to act for more than a few minutes because of this peculiar counteracting effect  1031 all these effects of retardation exhibited by decomposition against surfaces for which the evolved elements have more or less affinity or are altogether deficient in attraction show generally though beautifully the chemical relations and source of the current and also the balanced state of the affinities at the places of excitation and decomposition in this way they add to the mass of evidence in favour of the identity of the two for they demonstrate as it were the antagonism of the chemical powers at the electromotive part with the chemical powers at the interposed parts they show that the first are producing electric effects and the second opposing them they bring the two into direct relation they prove that either can determine the other thus making what appears to be cause and effect convertible and thereby demonstrating that both chemical and electrical action are merely two exhibitions of one single agent or power 916 c  1032 it is quite evident that as water and other electrolytes can conduct electricity without suffering decomposition 986 when the electricity is of sufficiently low intensity it may not be asserted as absolutely true in all cases that whenever electricity passes through an electrolyte it produces a definite effect of decomposition but the quantity of electricity which can pass in a given time through an electrolyte without causing decomposition is so small as to bear no comparison to that required in a case of very moderate decomposition and with electricity above the intensity required for electrolyzation i have found no sensible departure as yet from the law of definite electrolytic action developed in the preceding series of these researches 783 c  1033 i cannot dismiss this division of the present paper without making a reference to the important experiments of m aug de la rive on the effects of interposed platesa as i have had occasion to consider such plates merely as giving rise to new decompositions and in that way only causing obstruction to the passage of the electric current i was freed from the necessity of considering the peculiar effects described by that philosopher i was the more willing to avoid for the present touching upon these as i must at the same time have entered into the views of sir humphry davy upon the same subjectb and also those of marianinic and hitterd which are connected with it    a annales de chimie tom xxviii p 190 and mémoires de génève    b philosophical transactions 1826 p 413    c annales de chimie tom xxxiii pp 117 119 c    d journal de physique tom lvii pp 319 350   ¶ v general remarks on the active voltaic battery  1034 when the ordinary voltaic battery is brought into action its very activity produces certain effects which react upon it and cause serious deterioration of its power these render it an exceedingly inconstant instrument as to the quantity of effect which it is capable of producing they are already in part known and understood but as their importance and that of certain other coincident results will be more evident by reference to the principles and experiments already stated and described i have thought it would be useful in this investigation of the voltaic pile to notice them briefly here  1035 when the battery is in action it causes such substances to be formed and arranged in contact with the plates as very much weaken its power or even tend to produce a counter current they are considered by sir humphry davy as sufficient to account for the phenomena of ritters secondary piles and also for the effects observed by ma de la rive with interposed platina platesa    a philosophical transactions 1826 p 113  1036 i have already referred to this consequence 1003 as capable in some cases of lowering the force of the current to oneeighth or onetenth of what it was at the first moment and have met with instances in which its interference was very great in an experiment in which one voltaic pair and one interposed platina plate were used with dilute sulphuric acid in the cells fig 103 the wires of communication were so arranged that the end of that marked 3 could be placed at pleasure upon paper moistened in the solution of iodide of potassium at x or directly upon the platina plate there if after an interval during which the circuit had not been complete the wire 3 were placed upon the paper there was evidence of a current decomposition ensued and the galvanometer was affected if the wire 3 were made to touch the metal of p a comparatively strong sudden current was produced affecting the galvanometer but lasting only for a moment the effect at the galvanometer ceased and if the wire 3 were placed on the paper at x no signs of decomposition occurred on raising the wire 3 and breaking the circuit altogether for a while the apparatus resumed its first power requiring however from five to ten minutes for this purpose and then as before on making contact between 3 and p there was again a momentary current and immediately all the effects apparently ceased  1037 this effect i was ultimately able to refer to the state of the film of fluid in contact with the zinc plate in cell i the acid of that film is instantly neutralized by the oxide formed the oxidation of the zinc cannot of course go on with the same facility as before and the chemical action being thus interrupted the voltaic action diminishes with it the time of the rest was required for the diffusion of the liquid and its replacement by other acid from the serious influence of this cause in experiments with single pairs of plates of different metals in which i was at one time engaged and the extreme care required to avoid it i cannot help feeling a strong suspicion that it interferes more frequently and extensively than experimenters are aware of and therefore direct their attention to it  1038 in considering the effect in delicate experiments of this source of irregularity of action in the voltaic apparatus it must be remembered that it is only that very small portion of matter which is directly in contact with the oxidizable metal which has to be considered with reference to the change of its nature and this portion is not very readily displaced from its position upon the surface of the metal 582 605 especially if that metal be rough and irregular in illustration of this effect i will quote a remarkable experiment a burnished platina plate 569 was put into hot strong sulphuric acid for an instant only it was then put into distilled water moved about in it taken out and wiped dry it was put into a second portion of distilled water moved about in it and again wiped it was put into a third portion of distilled water in which it was moved about for nearly eight seconds it was then without wiping put into a fourth portion of distilled water where it was allowed to remain five minutes the two latter portions of water were then tested for sulphuric acid the third gave no sensible appearance of that substance but the fourth gave indications which were not merely evident but abundant for the circumstances under which it had been introduced the result sufficiently shows with what difficulty that portion of the substance which is in contact with the metal leaves it and as the contact of the fluid formed against the plate in the voltaic circuit must be as intimate and as perfect as possible it is easy to see how quickly and greatly it must vary from the general fluid in the cells and how influential in diminishing the force of the battery this effect must be  1039 in the ordinary voltaic pile the influence of this effect will occur in all variety of degrees the extremities of a trough of twenty pairs of plates of wollastons construction were connected with the voltaelectrometer fig 66 711 of the seventh series of these researches and after five minutes the number of bubbles of gas issuing from the extremity of the tube in consequence of the decomposition of the water noted without moving the plates the acid between the copper and zinc was agitated by the introduction of a feather the bubbles were immediately evolved more rapidly above twice the number being produced in the same portion of time as before in this instance it is very evident that agitation by a feather must have been a very imperfect mode of restoring the acid in the cells against the plates towards its first equal condition and yet imperfect as the means were they more than doubled the power of the battery the first effect of a battery which is known to be so superior to the degree of action which the battery can sustain is almost entirely due to the favourable condition of the acid in contact with the plates  1040 a second cause of diminution in the force of the voltaic battery consequent upon its own action is that extraordinary state of the surfaces of the metals 969 which was first described i believe by rittera to which he refers the powers of his secondary piles and which has been so well experimented upon by marianini and also by a de la rive if the apparatus fig 103 1096 be left in action for an hour or two with the wire 3 in contact with the plate p so as to allow a free passage for the current then though the contact be broken for ten or twelve minutes still upon its renewal only a feeble current will pass not at all equal in force to what might be expected further if p1 and p2 be connected by a metal wire a powerful momentary current will pass from p2 to p1 through the acid and therefore in the reverse direction to that produced by the action of the zinc in the arrangement and after this has happened the general current can pass through the whole of the system as at first but by its passage again restores the plates p2 and p1 into the former opposing condition this generally is the fact described by ritter marianini and de la rive it has great opposing influence on the action of a pile especially if the latter consist of but a small number of alternations and has to pass its current through many interpositions it varies with the solution in which the interposed plates are immersed with the intensity of the current the strength of the pile the time of action and especially with accidental discharges of the plates by inadvertent contacts or reversions of the plates during experiments and must be carefully watched in every endeavour to trace the source strength and variations of the voltaic current its effect was avoided in the experiments already described 1036 c by making contact between the plates p1 and p2 before the effect dependent upon the state of the solution in contact with the zinc plate was observed and by other precautions    a journal de physique lvii p 349  1041 when an apparatus like fig 98 1017 with several platina plates was used being connected with a battery able to force a current through them the power which they acquired of producing a reversed current was very considerable  1042 weak and exhausted charges should never be used at the same time with strong and fresh ones in the different cells of a trough or the different troughs of a battery the fluid in all the cells should be alike else the plates in the weaker cells in place of assisting retard the passage of the electricity generated in and transmitted across the stronger cells each zinc plate so circumstanced has to be assisted in decomposing power before the whole current can pass between it and the liquid so that if in a battery of fifty pairs of plates ten of the cells contain a weaker charge than the others it is as if ten decomposing plates were opposed to the transit of the current of forty pairs of generating plates 1031 hence a serious loss of force and hence the reason why if the ten pairs of plates were removed the remaining forty pairs would be much more powerful than the whole fifty  1043 five similar troughs of ten pairs of plates each were prepared four of them with a good uniform charge of acid and the fifth with the partially neutralized acid of a used battery being arranged in right order and connected with a voltaelectrometer 711 the whole fifty pairs of plates yielded 11 cubic inch of oxygen and hydrogen in one minute but on moving one of the connecting wires so that only the four wellcharged troughs should be included in the circuit they produced with the same voltaelectrometer 84 cubical inches of gas in the same time nearly seveneighths of the power of the four troughs had been lost therefore by their association with the fifth trough  1044 the same battery of fifty pairs of plates after being thus used was connected with a voltaelectrometer 711 so that by quickly shifting the wires of communication the current of the whole of the battery or of any portion of it could be made to pass through the instrument for given portions of time in succession the whole of the battery evolved 09 of a cubic inch of oxygen and hydrogen in half a minute the forty plates evolved 46 cubic inches in the same time the whole then evolved 1 cubic inch in the halfminute the ten weakly charged evolved 04 of a cubic inch in the time given and finally the whole evolved 115 cubic inch in the standard time the order of the observations was that given the results sufficiently show the extremely injurious effect produced by the mixture of strong and weak charges in the same batterya    a the gradual increase in the action of the whole fifty pairs of   plates was due to the elevation of temperature in the weakly charged   trough by the passage of the current in consequence of which the   exciting energies of the fluid within were increased  1045 in the same manner associations of strong and weak pairs of plates should be carefully avoided a pair of copper and platina plates arranged in accordance with a pair of zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric acid were found to stop the action of the latter or even of two pairs of the latter as effectually almost as an interposed plate of platina 1011 or as if the copper itself had been platina it in fact became an interposed decomposing plate and therefore a retarding instead of an assisting pair  1046 the reversal by accident or otherwise of the plates in a battery has an exceedingly injurious effect it is not merely the counteraction of the current which the reversed plates can produce but their effect also in retarding even as indifferent plates and requiring decomposition to be effected upon their surface in accordance with the course of the current before the latter can pass they oppose the current therefore in the first place as interposed platina plates would do 10111018 and to this they add a force of opposition as countervoltaic plates i find that in a series of four pairs of zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric acid if one pair be reversed it very nearly neutralizes the power of the whole  1047 there are many other causes of reaction retardation and irregularity in the voltaic battery amongst them is the not unusual one of precipitation of copper upon the zinc in the cells the injurious effect of which has before been adverted to 1006 but their interest is not perhaps sufficient to justify any increase of the length of this paper which is rather intended to be an investigation of the theory of the voltaic pile than a particular account of its practical applicationa    a for further practical results relating to these points of the   philosophy of the voltaic battery see series x § 17   11631160dec 1838  notemany of the views and experiments in this

sufficient in the way of correction at present for i would rather defer revising the whole theory of electrochemical decomposition until i can obtain clearer views of the way in which the power under

  § 15 on the influence by induction of an electric current on itselfand on the inductive action of electric currents generally  received december 18 1834read january 29 1835   1048 the following investigations relate to a very remarkable inductive action of electric currents or of the different parts of the same current 74 and indicate an immediate connexion between such inductive action and the direct transmission of electricity through conducting bodies or even that exhibited in the form of a spark  1049 the inquiry arose out of a fact communicated to me by mr jenkin which is as follows if an ordinary wire of short length be used as the medium of communication between the two plates of an electromotor consisting of a single pair of metals no management will enable the experimenter to obtain an electric shock from this wire but if the wire which surrounds an electromagnet be used a shock is felt each time the contact with the electromotor is broken provided the ends of the wire be grasped one in each hand  1050 another effect is observed at the same time which has long been known to philosophers namely that a bright electric spark occurs at the place of disjunction  1051 a brief account of these results with some of a corresponding character which i had observed in using long wires was published in the philosophical magazine for 1834a and i added to them some observations on their nature further investigations led me to perceive the inaccuracy of my first notions and ended in identifying these effects with the phenomena of induction which i had been fortunate enough to develop in the first series of these experimental researches 159b notwithstanding this identity the extension and the results supply lead me to believe that they will be found worthy of the attention of the royal society    a vol v pp 349 444    b philosophical transactions 1832 p 126  1052 the electromotor used consisted of a cylinder of zinc introduced between the two parts of a double cylinder of copper and preserved from metallic contact in the usual way by corks the zinc cylinder was eight inches high and four inches in diameter both it and the copper cylinder were supplied with stiff wires surmounted by cups containing mercury and it was at these cups that the contacts of wires helices or electromagnets used to complete the circuit were made or broken these cups i will call g and e throughout the rest of this paper 1079  1053 certain helices were constructed some of which it will be necessary to describe a pasteboard tube had four copper wires one twentyfourth of an inch in thickness wound round it each forming a helix in the same direction from end to end the convolutions of each wire were separated by string and the superposed helices prevented from touching by intervening calico the lengths of the wires forming the helices were 48 495 48 and 45 feet the first and third wires were united together so as to form one consistent helix of 96 feet in length and the second and fourth wires were similarly united to form a second helix closely interwoven with the first and 945 feet in length these helices may be distinguished by the numbers i and ii they were carefully examined by a powerful current of electricity and a galvanometer and found to have no communication with each other  1054 another helix was constructed upon a similar pasteboard tube two lengths of the same copper wire being used each fortysix feet long these were united into one consistent helix of ninetytwo feet which therefore was nearly equal in value to either of the former helices but was not in close inductive association with them it may be distinguished by the number iii  1055 a fourth helix was constructed of very thick copper wire being onefifth of an inch in diameter the length of wire used was seventynine feet independent of the straight terminal portions  1056 the principal electromagnet employed consisted of a cylindrical bar of soft iron twentyfive inches long and one inch and three quarters in diameter bent into a ring so that the ends nearly touched and surrounded by three coils of thick copper wire the similar ends of which were fastened together each of these terminations was soldered to a copper rod serving as a conducting continuation of the wire hence any electric current sent through the rods was divided in the helices surrounding the ring into three parts all of which however moved in the same direction the three wires may therefore be considered as representing one wire of thrice the thickness of the wire really used  1057 other electromagnets could be made at pleasure by introducing a soft iron rod into any of the helices described 1053 c  1058 the galvanometer which i had occasion to use was rough in its construction having but one magnetic needle and not at all delicate in its indications  1059 the effects to be considered depend on the conductor employed to complete the communication between the zinc and copper plates of the electromotor and i shall have to consider this conductor under four different forms as the helix of an electromagnet 1056 as an ordinary helix 1053 c as a long extended wire having its course such that the parts can exert little or no mutual influence and as a short wire in all cases the conductor was of copper  1060 the peculiar effects are best shown by the electromagnet 1056 when it was used to complete the communication at the electromotor there was no sensible spark on making contact but on breaking contact there was a very large and bright spark with considerable combustion of the mercury then again with respect to the shock if the hands were moistened in salt and water and good contact between them and the wires retained no shock could be felt upon making contact at the electromotor but a powerful one on breaking contact  1061 when the helix i or iii 1053 c was used as the connecting conductor there was also a good spark on breaking contact but none sensibly on making contact on trying to obtain the shock from these helices i could not succeed at first by joining the similar ends of i and ii so as to make the two helices equivalent to one helix having wire of double thickness i could just obtain the sensation using the helix of thick wire 1055 the shock was distinctly obtained on placing the tongue between two plates of silver connected by wires with the parts which the hands had heretofore touched 1064 there was a powerful shock on breaking contact but none on making contact  1062 the power of producing these phenomena exists therefore in the simple helix as in the electromagnet although by no means in the same high degree  1063 on putting a bar of soft iron into the helix it became an electromagnet 1057 and its power was instantly and greatly raised on putting a bar of copper into the helix no change was produced the action being that of the helix alone the two helices i and ii made into one helix of twofold length of wire produced a greater effect than either i or ii alone  1064 on descending from the helix to the mere long wire the following effects were obtained a copper wire 018 of an inch in diameter and 132 feet in length was laid out upon the floor of the laboratory and used as the connecting conductor 1059 it gave no sensible spark on making contact but produced a bright one on breaking contact yet not so bright as that from the helix 1061 on endeavouring to obtain the electric shock at the moment contact was broken i could not succeed so as to make it pass through the hands but by using two silver plates fastened by small wires to the extremity of the principal wire used and introducing the tongue between those plates i succeeded in obtaining powerful shocks upon the tongue and gums and could easily convulse a flounder an eel or a frog none of these effects could be obtained directly from the electromotor ie when the tongue frog or fish was in a similar and therefore comparative manner interposed in the course of the communication between the zinc and copper plates separated everywhere else by the acid used to excite the combination or by air the bright spark and the shock produced only on breaking contact are therefore effects of the same kind as those produced in a higher degree by the helix and in a still higher degree by the electromagnet  1065 in order to compare an extended wire with a helix the helix i containing ninetysix feet and ninetysix feet of the samesized wire lying on the floor of the laboratory were used alternately as conductors the former gave a much brighter spark at the moment of disjunction than the latter again twentyeight feet of copper wire were made up into a helix and being used gave a good spark on disjunction at the electromotor being then suddenly pulled out and again employed it gave a much smaller spark than before although nothing but its spiral arrangement had been changed  1066 as the superiority of a helix over a wire is important to the philosophy of the effect i took particular pains to ascertain the fact with certainty a wire of copper sixtyseven feet long was bent in the middle so as to form a double termination which could be communicated with the electromotor one of the halves of this wire was made into a helix and the other remained in its extended condition when these were used alternately as the connecting wire the helix half gave by much the strongest spark it even gave a stronger spark than when it and the extended wire were used conjointly as a double conductor  1067 when a short wire is used all these effects disappear if it be only two or three inches long a spark can scarcely be perceived on breaking the junction if it be ten or twelve inches long and moderately thick a small spark may be more easily obtained as the length is increased the spark becomes proportionately brighter until from extreme length the resistance offered by the metal as a conductor begins to interfere with the principal result  1068 the effect of elongation was well shown thus 114 feet of copper wire oneeighteenth of an inch in diameter were extended on the floor and used as a conductor it remained cold but gave a bright spark on breaking contact being crossed so that the two terminations were in contact near the extremities it was again used as a conductor only twelve inches now being included in the circuit the wire became very hot from the greater quantity of electricity passing through it and yet the spark on breaking contact was scarcely visible the experiment was repeated with a wire oneninth of an inch in diameter and thirtysix feet long with the same results  1069 that the effects and also the action in all these forms of the experiment are identical is evident from the manner in which the former can be gradually raised from that produced by the shortest wire to that of the most powerful electromagnet and this capability of examining what will happen by the most powerful apparatus and then experimenting for the same results or reasoning from them with the weaker arrangements is of great advantage in making out the true principles of the phenomena  1070 the action is evidently dependent upon the wire which serves as a conductor for it varies as that wire varies in its length or arrangement the shortest wire may be considered as exhibiting the full effect of spark or shock which the electromotor can produce by its own direct power all the additional force which the arrangements described can excite being due to some affection of the current either permanent or momentary in the wire itself that it is a momentary effect produced only at the instant of breaking contact will be fully proved 1089 1100  1071 no change takes place in the quantity or intensity of the current during the time the latter is continued from the moment after contact is made up to that previous to disunion except what depends upon the increased obstruction offered to the passage of the electricity by a long wire as compared to a short wire to ascertain this point with regard to quantity the helix i 1053 and the galvanometer 1055 were both made parts of the metallic circuit used to connect the plates of a small electromotor and the deflection at the galvanometer was observed then a soft iron core was put into the helix and as soon as the momentary effect was over and the needle had become stationary it was again observed and found to stand exactly at the same division as before thus the quantity passing through the wire when the current was continued was the same either with or without the soft iron although the peculiar effects occurring at the moment of disjunction were very different in degree under such variation of circumstances  1072 that the quality of intensity belonging to the constant current did not vary with the circumstances favouring the peculiar results under consideration so as to yield an explanation of those results was ascertained in the following manner the current excited by an electromotor was passed through short wires and its intensity tried by subjecting different substances to its electrolyzing power 912 966 c it was then passed through the wires of the powerful electromagnet 1056 and again examined with respect to its intensity by the same means and found unchanged again the constancy of the quantity passed in the above experiment 1071 adds further proof that the intensity could not have varied for had it been increased upon the introduction of the soft iron there is every reason to believe that the quantity passed in a given time would also have increased  1073 the fact is that under many variations of the experiments the permanent current loses in force as the effects upon breaking contact become exalted this is abundantly evident in the comparative experiments with long and short wires 1068 and is still more strikingly shown by the following variation solder an inch or two in length of fine platina wire about onehundredth of an inch in diameter on to one end of the long communicating wire and also a similar length of the same platina wire on to one end of the short communication then in comparing the effects of these two communications make and break contact between the platina terminations and the mercury of the cup g or e 1079 when the short wire is used the platina will be ignited by the constant current because of the quantity of electricity but the spark on breaking contact will be hardly visible on using the longer communicating wire which by obstructing will diminish the current the platina will remain cold whilst the current passes but give a bright spark at the moment it ceases thus the strange result is obtained of a diminished spark and shock from the strong current and increased effects from the weak one hence the spark and shock at the moment of disjunction although resulting from great intensity and quantity of the current at that moment are no direct indicators or measurers of the intensity or quantity of the constant current previously passing and by which they are ultimately produced                                       1074 it is highly important in using the spark as an indication by its relative brightness of these effects to bear in mind certain circumstances connected with its production and appearance 958 an ordinary electric spark is understood to be the bright appearance of electricity passing suddenly through an interval of air or other badly conducting matter a voltaic spark is sometimes of the same nature but generally is due to the ignition and even combustion of a minute portion of a good conductor and that is especially the case when the electromotor consists of but one or few pairs of plates this can be very well observed if either or both of the metallic surfaces intended to touch be solid and pointed the moment they come in contact the current passes it heats ignites and even burns the touching points and the appearance is as if the spark passed on making contact whereas it is only a case of ignition by the current contact being previously made and is perfectly analogous to the ignition of a fine platina wire connecting the extremities of a voltaic battery  1075 when mercury constitutes one or both of the surfaces used the brightness of the spark is greatly increased but as this effect is due to the action on and probable combustion of the metal such sparks must only be compared with other sparks also taken from mercurial surfaces and not with such as may be taken for instance between surfaces of platina or gold for then the appearances are far less bright though the same quantity of electricity be passed it is not at all unlikely that the commonly occurring circumstance of combustion may affect even the duration of the light and that sparks taken between mercury copper or other combustible bodies will continue for a period sensibly longer than those passing between platina or gold  1076 when the end of a short clean copper wire attached to one plate of an electromotor is brought down carefully upon a surface of mercury connected with the other plate a spark almost continuous can be obtained this i refer to a succession of effects of the following nature first contactthen ignition of the touching pointsrecession of the mercury from the mechanical results of the heat produced at the place of contact and the electromagnetic condition of the parts at the momenta breaking of the contact and the production of the peculiar intense effect dependent thereonrenewal of the contact by the returning surface of the undulating mercuryand then a repetition of the same series of effects and that with such rapidity as to present the appearance of a continued discharge if a long wire or an electromagnet be used as the connecting conductor instead of a short wire a similar appearance may be produced by tapping the vessel containing the mercury and making it vibrate but the sparks do not usually follow each other so rapidly as to produce an apparently continuous spark because of the time required when the long wire or electromagnet is used both for the full development of the current 1101 1106 and for its complete cessation    a quarterly journal of science vol xii p 420  1077 returning to the phenomena in question the first thought that arises in the mind is that the electricity circulates with something like momentum or inertia in the wire and that thus a long wire produces effects at the instant the current is stopped which a short wire cannot produce such an explanation is however at once set aside by the fact that the same length of wire produces the effects in very different degrees according as it is simply extended or made into a helix or forms the circuit of an electromagnet 1069 the experiments to be adduced 1089 will still more strikingly show that the idea of momentum cannot apply  1078 the bright spark at the electromotor and the shock in the arms appeared evidently to be due to one current in the long wire divided into two parts by the double channel afforded through the body and through the electromotor for that the spark was evolved at the place of disjunction with the electromotor not by any direct action of the latter but by a force immediately exerted in the wire of communication seemed to be without doubt 1070 it followed therefore that by using a better conductor in place of the human body the whole of this extra current might be made to pass at that place and thus be separated from that which the electromotor could produce by its immediate action and its direction be examined apart from any interference of the original and originating current this was found to be true for on connecting the ends of the principal wire together by a cross wire two or three feet in length applied just where the hands had felt the shock the whole of the extra current passed by the new channel and then no better spark than one producible by a short wire was obtained on disjunction at the electromotor  1079 the current thus separated was examined by galvanometers and decomposing apparatus introduced into the course of this wire i will always speak of it as the current in the cross wire or wires so that no mistake as to its place or origin may occur in the woodcut z and c represent the zinc and copper plates of the electromotor g and e the cups of mercury where contact is made or broken 1052 a and b the terminations of d the long wire the helix or the electromagnet used to complete the circuit n and p are the cross wires which can either be brought into contact at x or else have a galvanometer 1058 or an electrolyzing apparatus 312 316 interposed there  illustration  the production of the shock from the current in the cross wire whether d was a long extended wire or a helix or an electromagnet has been already described 1060 1061 1064  1080 the spark of the crosswire current could be produced at x in the following manner d was made an electromagnet the metallic extremities at x were held close together or rubbed lightly against each other whilst contact was broken at g or e when the communication was perfect at x little or no spark appeared at g or e when the condition of vicinity at x was favourable for the result required a bright spark would pass there at the moment of disjunction none occurring at g and e this spark was the luminous passage of the extra current through the crosswires when there was no contact or passage of current at x then the spark appeared at g or e the extra current forcing its way through the electromotor itself the same results were obtained by the use of the helix or the extended wire at d in place of the electromagnet  1081 on introducing a fine platina wire at x and employing the electromagnet at d no visible effects occurred as long as contact was continued but on breaking contact at g or e the fine wire was instantly ignited and fused a longer or thicker wire could be so adjusted at x as to show ignition without fusion every time the contact was broken at g or e  1082 it is rather difficult to obtain this effect with helices or wires and for very simple reasons with the helices i ii or iii there was such retardation of the electric current from the length of wire used that a full inch of platina wire onefiftieth of an inch in diameter could be retained ignited at the crosswires during the continuance of contact by the portion of electricity passing through it hence it was impossible to distinguish the particular effects at the moments of making or breaking contact from this constant effect on using the thick wire helix 1055 the same results ensued  1083 proceeding upon the known fact that electric currents of great quantity but low intensity though able to ignite thick wires cannot produce that effect upon thin ones i used a very fine platina wire at x reducing its diameter until a spark appeared at g or e when contact was broken there a quarter of an inch of such wire might be introduced at x without being ignited by the continuance of contact at g or e but when contact was broken at either place this wire became redhot proving by this method the production of the induced current at that moment  1084 chemical decomposition was next effected by the crosswire current an electromagnet being used at d and a decomposing apparatus with solution of iodide of potassium in paper 1079 employed at x the conducting power of the connecting system a b d was sufficient to carry all the primary current and consequently no chemical action took place at x during the continuance of contact at g and e but when contact was broken there was instantly decomposition at x the iodine appeared against the wire n and not against the wire p thus demonstrating that the current through the crosswires when contact was broken was in the reverse direction to that marked by the arrow or that which the electromotor would have sent through it  1085 in this experiment a bright spark occurs at the place of disjunction indicating that only a small part of the extra current passed the apparatus at x because of the small conducting power of the latter  1086 i found it difficult to obtain the chemical effects with the simple helices and wires in consequence of the diminished inductive power of these arrangements and because of the passage of a strong constant current at x whenever a very active electromotor was used 1082  1087 the most instructive set of results was obtained however when the galvanometer was introduced at x using an electromagnet at d and continuing contact a current was then indicated by the deflection proceeding from p to n in the direction of the arrow the crosswire serving to carry one part of the electricity excited by the electromotor and that part of the arrangement marked a b d the other and far greater part as indicated by the arrows the magnetic needle was then forced back by pins applied upon opposite sides of its two extremities to its natural position when uninfluenced by a current after which contact being broken at g or e it was deflected strongly in the opposite direction thus showing in accordance with the chemical effects 1084 that the extra current followed a course in the crosswires contrary to that indicated by the arrow i e contrary to the one produced by the direct action of the electromotora    a it was ascertained experimentally that if a strong current was   passed through the galvanometer only and the needle restrained in one   direction as above in its natural position when the current was   stopped no vibration of the needle in the opposite direction took   place  1088 with the helix only 1061 these effects could scarcely be observed in consequence of the smaller inductive force of this arrangement the opposed action from induction in the galvanometer wire itself the mechanical condition and tension of the needle from the effect of blocking 1087 whilst the current due to continuance of contact was passing round it and because of other causes with the extended wire 1064 all these circumstances had still greater influence and therefore allowed less chance of success  1089 these experiments establishing as they did by the quantity intensity and even direction a distinction between the primary or generating current and the extra current led me to conclude that the latter was identical with the induced current described 6 26 74 in the first series of these researches and this opinion i was soon able to bring to proof and at the same times obtained not the partial 1078 but entire separation of one current from the other  1090 the double helix 1053 was arranged so that it should form the connecting wire between the plates of the electromotor in being out of the current and its ends unconnected in this condition it acted very well and gave a good spark at the time and place of disjunction the opposite ends of ii were then connected together so as to form an endless wire i remaining unchanged but now no spark or one scarcely sensible could be obtained from the latter at the place of disjunction then again the ends of ii were held so nearly together that any current running round that helix should be rendered visible as a spark and in this manner a spark was obtained from ii when the junction of i with the electromotor was broken in place of appearing at the disjoined extremity of i itself  1091 by introducing a galvanometer or decomposing apparatus into the circuit formed by the helix ii i could easily obtain the deflections and decomposition occasioned by the induced current due to the breaking contact at helix i or even to that occasioned by making contact of that helix with the electromotor the results in both cases indicating the contrary directions of the two induced currents thus produced 26  1092 all these effects except those of decomposition were reproduced by two extended long wires not having the form of helices but placed close to each other and thus it was proved that the extra current could be removed from the wire carrying the original current to a neighbouring wire and was at the same time identified in direction and every other respect with the currents producible by induction 1089 the case therefore of the bright spark and shock on disjunction may now be stated thus if a current be established in a wire and another wire forming a complete circuit be placed parallel to the first at the moment the current in the first is stopped it induces a current in the same direction in the second the first exhibiting then but a feeble spark but if the second wire be away disjunction of the first wire induces a current in itself in the same direction producing a strong spark the strong spark in the single long wire or helix at the moment of disjunction is therefore the equivalent of the current which would be produced in a neighbouring wire if such second current were permitted  1093 viewing the phenomena as the results of the induction of electrical currents many of the principles of action in the former experiments become far more evident and precise thus the different effects of short wires long wires helices and electromagnets 1069 may be comprehended if the inductive action of a wire a foot long upon a collateral wire also a foot in length be observed it will be found very small but if the same current be sent through a wire fifty feet long it will induce in a neighbouring wire of fifty feet a far more powerful current at the moment of making or breaking contact each successive foot of wire adding to the sum of action and by parity of reasoning a similar effect should take place when the conducting wire is also that in which the induced current is formed 74 hence the reason why a long wire gives a brighter spark on breaking contact than a short one 1068 although it carries much less electricity  1094 if the long wire be made into a helix it will then be still more effective in producing sparks and shocks on breaking contact for by the mutual inductive action of the convolutions each aids its neighbour and will be aided in turn and the sum of effect will be very greatly increased  1095 if an electromagnet be employed the effect will be still more highly exalted because the iron magnetized by the power of the continuing current will lose its magnetism at the moment the current ceases to pass and in so doing will tend to produce an electric current in the wire around it 37 38 in conformity with that which the cessation of current in the helix itself also tends to produce  1096 by applying the laws of the induction of electric currents formerly developed 6 c various new conditions of the experiments could be devised which by their results should serve as tests of the accuracy of the view just given thus if a long wire be doubled so that the current in the two halves shall have opposite actions it ought not to give a sensible spark at the moment of disjunction and this proved to be the case for a wire forty feet long covered with silk being doubled and tied closely together to within four inches of the extremities when used in that state gave scarcely a perceptible spark but being opened out and the parts separated it gave a very good one the two helices i and ii being joined at their similar ends and then used at their other extremities to connect the plates of the electromotor thus constituted one long helix of which one half was opposed in direction to the other half under these circumstances it gave scarcely a sensible spark even when the soft iron core was within although containing nearly two hundred feet of wire when it was made into one consistent helix of the same length of wire it gave a very bright spark  1097 similar proofs can be drawn from the mutual inductive action of two separate currents 1110 and it is important for the general principles that the consistent action of two such currents should be established thus two currents going in the same direction should if simultaneously stopped aid each other by their relative influence or if proceeding in contrary directions should oppose each other under similar circumstances i endeavoured at first to obtain two currents from two different electromotors and passing them through the helices i and ii tried to effect the disjunctions mechanically at the same moment but in this i could not succeed one was always separated before the other and in that case produced little or no spark its inductive power being employed in throwing a current round the remaining complete circuit 1090 the current which was stopped last always gave a bright spark if it were ever to become needful to ascertain whether two junctions were accurately broken at the same moment these sparks would afford a test for the purpose having an infinitesimal degree of perfection  1098 i was able to prove the points by other expedients two short thick wires were selected to serve as terminations by which contact could be made or broken with the electromotor the compound helix consisting of i and ii 1053 was adjusted so that the extremities of the two helices could be placed in communication with the two terminal wires in such a manner that the current moving through the thick wires should be divided into two equal portions in the two helices these portions travelling according to the mode of connexion either in the same direction or in contrary directions at pleasure in this manner two streams could be obtained both of which could be stopped simultaneously because the disjunction could be broken at g or f by removing a single wire when the helices were in contrary directions there was scarcely a sensible spark at the place of disjunction but when they were in accordance there was a very bright one  1099 the helix i was now used constantly being sometimes associated as above with helix ii in an according direction and sometimes with helix iii which was placed at a little distance the association i and ii which presented two currents able to affect each other by induction because of their vicinity gave a brighter spark than the association i and iii where the two streams could not exert their mutual influence but the difference was not so great as i expected  1100 thus all the phenomena tend to prove that the effects are due to an inductive action occurring at the moment when the principal current is stopped i at one time thought they were due to an action continued during the whole time of the current and expected that a steel magnet would have an influence according to its position in the helix comparable to that of a soft iron bar in assisting the effect this however is not the case for hard steel or a magnet in the helix is not so effectual as soft iron nor does it make any difference how the magnet is placed in the helix and for very simple reasons namely that the effect does not depend upon a permanent state of the core but a change of state and that the magnet or hard steel cannot sink through such a difference of state as soft iron at the moment contact ceases and therefore cannot produce an equal effect in generating a current of electricity by induction 34 37                                       1101 as an electric current acts by induction with equal energy at the moment of its commencement as at the moment of its cessation 10 26 but in a contrary direction the reference of the effects under examination to an inductive action would lead to the conclusion that corresponding effects of an opposite nature must occur in a long wire a helix or an electromagnet every time that contact is made with the electromotor these effects will tend to establish a resistance for the first moment in the long conductor producing a result equivalent to the reverse of a shock or a spark now it is very difficult to devise means fit for the recognition of such negative results but as it is probable that some positive effect is produced at the time if we knew what to expect i think the few facts bearing upon this subject with which i am acquainted are worth recording  1102 the electromagnet was arranged with an electrolyzing apparatus at x as before described 1084 except that the intensity of the chemical action at the electromotor was increased until the electric current was just able to produce the feeblest signs of decomposition whilst contact was continued at g and e 1079 the iodine of course appearing against the end of the cross wire p the wire n was also separated from a at r so that contact there could be made or broken at pleasure under these circumstances the following set of actions was repeated several times contact was broken at r then broken at g next made at r and lastly renewed at g thus any current from n to p due to breaking of contact was avoided but any additional force to the current from p to n due to making contact could be observed in this way it was found that a much greater decomposing effect causing the evolution of iodine against p could be obtained by a few completions of contact than by the current which could pass in a much longer time if the contact was continued this i attribute to the act of induction in the wire abd at the moment of contact rendering that wire a worse conductor or rather retarding the passage of the electricity through it for the instant and so throwing a greater quantity of the electricity which the electromotor could produce through the cross wire passage np the instant the induction ceased abd resumed its full power of carrying a constant current of electricity and could have it highly increased as we know by the former experiments 1060 by the opposite inductive action brought into activity at the moment contact at z or c was broken  1103 a galvanometer was then introduced at x and the deflection of the needle noted whilst contact was continued at g and e the needle was then blocked as before in one direction 1087 so that it should not return when the current ceased but remain in the position in which the current could retain it contact at g or e was broken producing of course no visible effect it was then renewed and the needle was instantly deflected passing from the blocking pins to a position still further from its natural place than that which the constant current could give and thus showing by the temporary excess of current in this cross communication the temporary retardation in the circuit abd  1104 on adjusting a platina wire at x 1081 so that it should not be ignited by the current passing through it whilst contact at g and e was continued and yet become redhot by a current somewhat more powerful i was readily able to produce its ignition upon making contact and again upon breaking contact thus the momentary retardation in abd on making contact was again shown by this result as well also as the opposite result upon breaking contact the two ignitions of the wire at x were of course produced by electric currents moving in opposite directions  1105 using the helix only i could not obtain distinct deflections at x due to the extra effect on making contact for the reasons already mentioned 1088 by using a very fine platina wire there 1083 i did succeed in obtaining the igniting effect for making contact in the same manner though by no means to the same degree as with the electromagnet 1104  1106 we may also consider and estimate the effect on making contact by transferring the force of induction from the wire carrying the original current to a lateral wire as in the cases described 1090 and we then are sure both by the chemical and galvanometrical results 1091 that the forces upon making and breaking contact like action and reaction are equal in their strength but contrary in their direction if therefore the effect on making contact resolves itself into a mere retardation of the current at the first moment of its existence it must be in its degree equivalent to the high exaltation of that same current at the moment contact is broken  1107 thus the case under the circumstances is that the intensity and quantity of electricity moving in a current are smaller when the current commences or is increased and greater when it diminishes or ceases than they would be if the inductive action occurring at these moments did not take place or than they are in the original current wire if the inductive action be transferred from that wire to a collateral one 1090  1108 from the facility of transference to neighbouring wires and from the effects generally the inductive forces appear to be lateral ie exerted in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the originating and produced currents and they also appear to be accurately represented by the magnetic curves and closely related to if not identical with magnetic forces  1109 there can be no doubt that the current in one part of a wire can act by induction upon other parts of the same wire which are lateral to the first ie in the same vertical section 74 or in the parts which are more or less oblique to it 1112 just as it can act in producing a current in a neighbouring wire or in a neighbouring coil of the same wire it is this which gives the appearance of the current acting upon itself but all the experiments and all analogy tend to show that the elements if i may so say of the currents do not act upon themselves and so cause the effect in question but produce it by exciting currents in conducting matter which is lateral to them  1110 it is possible that some of the expressions i have used may seem to imply that the inductive action is essentially the action of one current upon another or of one element of a current upon another element of the same current to avoid any such conclusion i must explain more distinctly my meaning if an endless wire be taken we have the means of generating a current in it which shall run round the circuit without adding any electricity to what was previously in the wire as far as we can judge the electricity which appears as a current is the same as that which before was quiescent in the wire and though we cannot as yet point out the essential condition of difference of the electricity at such times we can easily recognize the two states now when a current acts by induction upon conducting matter lateral to it it probably acts upon the electricity in that conducting matter whether it be in the form of a current or quiescent in the one case increasing or diminishing the current according to its direction in the other producing a current and the amount of the inductive action is probably the same in both cases hence to say that the action of induction depended upon the mutual relation of two or more currents would according to the restricted sense in which the term current is understood at present 283 517 667 be an error  1111 several of the effects as for instances those with helices1066 with according or counter currents 1097 1098 and those on the production of lateral currents 1090 appeared to indicate that a current could produce an effect of induction in a neighbouring wire more readily than in its own carrying wire in which case it might be expected that some variation of result would be produced if a bundle of wires were used as a conductor instead of a single wire in consequence the following experiments were made a copper wire one twentythird of an inch in diameter was cut into lengths of five feet each and six of these being laid side by side in one bundle had their opposite extremities soldered to two terminal pieces of copper this arrangement could be used as a discharging wire but the general current could be divided into six parallel streams which might be brought close together or by the separation of the wires be taken more or less out of each others influence a somewhat brighter spark was i think obtained on breaking contact when the six wires were close together than when held asunder  1112 another bundle containing twenty of these wires was eighteen feet long the terminal pieces were onefifth of an inch in diameter and each six inches long this was compared with nineteen feet in length of copper wire onefifth of an inch in diameter the bundle gave a smaller spark on breaking contact than the latter even when its strands were held together by string when they were separated it gave a still smaller spark upon the whole however the diminution of effect was not such as i expected and i doubt whether the results can be considered as any proof of the truth of the supposition which gave rise to them  1113 the inductive force by which two elements of one current 1109 1110 act upon each other appears to diminish as the line joining them becomes oblique to the direction of the current and to vanish entirely when it is parallel i am led by some results to suspect that it then even passes into the repulsive force noticed by ampèrea which is the cause of the elevations in mercury described by sir humphry davyb and which again is probably directly connected with the quality of intensity    a recueil dobservations electrodynamiques p 285    b philosophical transactions 1823 p 155  1114 notwithstanding that the effects appear only at the making and breaking of contact the current remaining unaffected seemingly in the interval i cannot resist the impression that there is some connected and correspondent effect produced by this lateral action of the elements of the electric stream during the time of its continuance 60 242 an action of this kind in fact is evident in the magnetic relations of the parts of the current but admitting as we may do for the moment the magnetic forces to constitute the power which produces such striking and different results at the commencement and termination of a current still there appears to be a link in the chain of effects a wheel in the physical mechanism of the action as yet unrecognised if we endeavour to consider electricity and magnetism as the results of two forces of a physical agent or a peculiar condition of matter exerted in determinate directions perpendicular to each other then it appears to me that we must consider these two states or forces as convertible into each other in a greater or smaller degree ie that an element of an electric current has not a determinate electric force and a determinate magnetic force constantly existing in the same ratio but that the two forces are to a certain degree convertible by a process or change of condition at present unknown to us how else can a current of a given intensity and quantity be able by its direct action to sustain a state which when allowed to react at the cessation of the original current shall produce a second current having an intensity and quantity far greater than the generating one this cannot result from a direct reaction of the electric force and if it result from a change of electrical into magnetic force and a reconversion back again it will show that they differ in something more than mere direction as regards that agent in the conducting wire which constitutes their immediate cause  1115 with reference to the appearance at different times of the contrary effects produced by the making and breaking contact and their separation by an intermediate and indifferent state this separation is probably more apparent than real if the conduction of electricity be effected by vibrations 283 or by any other mode in which opposite forces are successively and rapidly excited and neutralized then we might expect a peculiar and contrary development of force at the commencement and termination of the periods during which the conducting action should last somewhat in analogy with the colours produced at the outside of an imperfectly developed solar spectrum and the intermediate actions although not sensible in the same way may be very important and for instance perhaps constitute the very essence of conductibility it is by views and reasons such as these which seem to me connected with the fundamental laws and facts of electrical science that i have been induced to enter more minutely than i otherwise should have done into the experimental examination of the phenomena described in this paper  1116 before concluding i may briefly remark that on using a voltaic battery of fifty pairs of plates instead of a single pair 1052 the effects were exactly of the same kind the spark on making contact for the reasons before given was very small 1101 1107 that on breaking contact very excellent and brilliant the continuous discharge did not seem altered in character whether a short wire or the powerful electromagnet were used as a connecting discharger  1117 the effects produced at the commencement and end of a current which are separated by an interval of time when that current is supplied from a voltaic apparatus must occur at the same moment when a common electric discharge is passed through a long wire whether if happening accurately at the same moment they would entirely neutralize each other or whether they would not still give some definite peculiarity to the discharge is a matter remaining to be examined but it is very probable that the peculiar character and pungency of sparks drawn from a long wire depend in part upon the increased intensity given at the termination of the discharge by the inductive action then occurring  1118 in the wire of the helix of magnetoelectric machines as for instance in mr saxtons beautiful arrangement an important influence of these principles of action is evidently shown from the construction of the apparatus the current is permitted to move in a complete metallic circuit of great length during the first instants of its formation it gradually rises in strength and is then suddenly stopped by the breaking of the metallic circuit and thus great intensity is given by induction to the electricity which at that moment passes 1064 1060 this intensity is not only shown by the brilliancy of the spark and the strength of the shock but also by the necessity which has been experienced of wellinsulating the convolutions of the helix in which the current is formed and it gives to the current a force at these moments very far above that which the apparatus could produce if the principle which forms the subject of this paper were not called into play  royal institution december 8th 1834     tenth series   § 16 on an improved form of the voltaic battery § 17 some practical results respecting the construction and use of the voltaic battery  received june 16read june 18 1835   1119 i have lately had occasion to examine the voltaic trough practically with a view to improvements in its construction and use and though i do not pretend that the results have anything like the importance which attaches to the discovery of a new law or principle i still think they are valuable and may therefore if briefly told and in connexion with former papers be worthy the approbation of the royal society  § 16 on an improved form of the voltaic battery   1120 in a simple voltaic circuit and the same is true of the battery the chemical forces which during their activity give power to the instrument are generally divided into two portions one of these is exerted locally whilst the other is transferred round the circle 947 996 the latter constitutes the electric current of the instrument whilst the former is altogether lost or wasted the ratio of these two portions of power may be varied to a great extent by the influence of circumstances thus in a battery not closed all the action is local in one of the ordinary construction much is in circulation when the extremities are in communication and in the perfect one which i have described 1001 all the chemical power circulates and becomes electricity by referring to the quantity of zinc dissolved from the plates 865 1120 and the quantity of decomposition effected in the voltaelectrometer 711 1126 or elsewhere the proportions of the local and transferred actions under any particular circumstances can be ascertained and the efficacy of the voltaic arrangement or the waste of chemical power at its zinc plates be accurately determined  1121 if a voltaic battery were constructed of zinc and platina the latter metal surrounding the former as in the double copper arrangement and the whole being excited by dilute sulphuric acid then no insulating divisions of glass porcelain or air would be required between the contiguous platina surfaces and provided these did not touch metallically the same acid which being between the zinc and platina would excite the battery into powerful action would between the two surfaces of platina produce no discharge of the electricity nor cause any diminution of the power of the trough this is a necessary consequence of the resistance to the passage of the current which i have shown occurs at the place of decomposition 1007 1011 for that resistance is fully able to stop the current and therefore acts as insulation to the electricity of the contiguous plates inasmuch as the current which tends to pass between them never has a higher intensity than that due to the action of a single pair  1122 if the metal surrounding the zinc be copper 1045 and if the acid be nitrosulphuric acid 1020 then a slight discharge between the two contiguous coppers does take place provided there be no other channel open by which the forces may circulate but when such a channel is permitted the return or back discharge of which i speak is exceedingly diminished in accordance with the principles laid down in the eighth series of these researches  1123 guided by these principles i was led to the construction of a voltaic trough in which the coppers passing round both surfaces of the zincs as in wollastons construction should not be separated from each other except by an intervening thickness of paper or in some other way so as to prevent metallic contact and should thus constitute an instrument compact powerful economical and easy of use on examining however what had been done before i found that the new trough was in all essential respects the same as that invented and described by dr hare professor in the university of pennsylvania to whom i have great pleasure in referring it  1124 dr hare has fully described his trougha in it the contiguous copper plates are separated by thin veneers of wood and the acid is poured on to or off the plates by a quarter revolution of an axis to which both the trough containing the plates and another trough to collect and hold the liquid are fixed this arrangement i have found the most convenient of any and have therefore adopted it my zinc plates were cut from rolled metal and when soldered to the copper plates had the form delineated fig 1 these were then bent over a gauge into the form fig 2 and when packed in the wooden box constructed to receive them were arranged as in fig 3b little plugs of cork being used to keep the zinc plates from touching the copper plates and a single or double thickness of cartridge paper being interposed between the contiguous surfaces of copper to prevent them from coming in contact such was the facility afforded by this arrangement that a trough of forty pairs of plates could be unpacked in five minutes and repacked again in half an hour and the whole series was not more than fifteen inches in length  illustration fig 1  illustration fig 2  illustration fig 3    a philosophical magazine 1824 vol lxiii p 241 or sillimans   journal vol vii see also a previous paper by dr hare annals of   philosophy 1821 vol i p 329 in which he speaks of the   nonnecessity of insulation between the coppers    b the papers between the coppers are for the sake of distinctness   omitted in the figure  1125 this trough of forty pairs of plates three inches square was compared as to the ignition of a platina wire the discharge between points of charcoal the shock on the human frame c with forty pairs of fourinch plates having double coppers and used in porcelain troughs divided into insulating cells the strength of the acid employed to excite both being the same in all these effects the former appeared quite equal to the latter on comparing a second trough of the new construction containing twenty pairs of fourinch plates with twenty pairs of fourinch plates in porcelain troughs excited by acid of the same strength the new trough appeared to surpass the old one in producing these effects especially in the ignition of wire  1126 in these experiments the new trough diminished in its energy much more rapidly than the one on the old construction and this was a necessary consequence of the smaller quantity of acid used to excite it which in the case of the forty pairs of new construction was only oneseventh part of that used for the forty pairs in the porcelain troughs to compare therefore both forms of the voltaic trough in their decomposing powers and to obtain accurate data as to their relative values experiments of the following kind were made the troughs were charged with a known quantity of acid of a known strength the electric current was passed through a voltaelectrometer 711 having electrodes 4 inches long and 23 inches in width so as to oppose as little obstruction as possible to the current the gases evolved were collected and measured and gave the quantity of water decomposed then the whole of the charge used was mixed together and a known part of it analyzed by being precipitated and boiled with excess of carbonate of soda and the precipitate wellwashed dried ignited and weighed in this way the quantity of metal oxidized and dissolved by the acid was ascertained and the part removed from each zinc plate or from all the plates could be estimated and compared with the water decomposed in the voltaelectrometer to bring these to one standard of comparison i have reduced the results so as to express the loss at the plates in equivalents of zinc for the equivalent of water decomposed at the voltaelectrometer i have taken the equivalent number of water as 9 and of zinc as 325 and have considered 100 cubic inches of the mixed oxygen and hydrogen as they were collected over a pneumatic trough to result from the decomposition of 1268 grains of water  1127 the acids used in these experiments were threesulphuric nitric and muriatic the sulphuric acid was strong oil of vitriol one cubical inch of it was equivalent to 486 grains of marble the nitric acid was very nearly pure one cubical inch dissolved 150 grains of marble the muriatic acid was also nearly pure and one cubical inch dissolved 108 grains of marble these were always mixed with water by volumes the standard of volume being a cubical inch  1128 an acid was prepared consisting of 200 parts water 412 parts sulphuric acid and 4 parts nitric acid and with this both my trough containing forty pairs of threeinch plates and four porcelain troughs arranged in succession each containing ten pairs of plates with double coppers four inches square were charged these two batteries were then used in succession and the action of each was allowed to continue for twenty or thirty minutes until the charge was nearly exhausted the connexion with the voltaelectrometer being carefully preserved during the whole time and the acid in the troughs occasionally mixed together in this way the former trough acted so well that for each equivalent of water decomposed in the voltaelectrometer only from 2 to 25 equivalents of zinc were dissolved from each plate in four experiments the average was 221 equivalents for each plate or 884 for the whole battery in the experiments with the porcelain troughs the equivalents of consumption at each plate were 351 or 1416 for the whole battery in a perfect voltaic battery of forty pairs of plates 991 1001 the consumption would have been one equivalent for each zinc plate or forty for the whole  1129 similar experiments were made with two voltaic batteries one containing twenty pairs of fourinch plates arranged as i have described 1124 and the other twenty pairs of fourinch plates in porcelain troughs the average of five experiments with the former was a consumption of 37 equivalents of zinc from each plate or 74 from the whole the average of three experiments with the latter was 55 equivalents from each plate or 110 from the whole to obtain this conclusion two experiments were struck out which were much against the porcelain troughs and in which some unknown deteriorating influence was supposed to be accidentally active in all the experiments care was taken not to compare new and old plates together as that would have introduced serious errors into the conclusions 1146  1130 when ten pairs of the new arrangement were used the consumption of zinc at each plate was 676 equivalents or 676 for the whole with ten pairs of the common construction in a porcelain trough the zinc oxidized was upon an average 155 equivalents each plate or 155 for the entire trough  1131 no doubt therefore can remain of the equality or even the great superiority of this form of voltaic battery over the best previously in use namely that with double coppers in which the cells are insulated the insulation of the coppers may therefore be dispensed with and it is that circumstance which principally permits of such other alterations in the construction of the trough as gives it its practical advantages  1132 the advantages of this form of trough are very numerous and great i it is exceedingly compact for 100 pairs of plates need not occupy a trough of more than three feet in length ii by dr hares plan of making the trough turn upon copper pivots which rest upon copper bearings the latter afford fixed terminations and these i have found it very convenient to connect with two cups of mercury fastened in the front of the stand of the instrument these fixed terminations give the great advantage of arranging an apparatus to be used in connexion with the battery before the latter is put into action iii the trough is put into readiness for use in an instant a single jug of dilute acid being sufficient for the charge of 100 pairs of fourinch plates iv on making the trough pass through a quarter of a revolution it becomes active and the great advantage is obtained of procuring for the experiment the effect of the first contact of the zinc and acid which is twice or sometimes even thrice that which the battery can produce a minute or two after 1036 1150 v when the experiment is completed the acid can be at once poured from between the plates so that the battery is never left to waste during an unconnected state of its extremities the acid is not unnecessarily exhausted the zinc is not uselessly consumed and besides avoiding these evils the charge is mixed and rendered uniform which produces a great and good result 1039 and upon proceeding to a second experiment the important effect of first contact is again obtained vi the saving of zinc is very great it is not merely that whilst in action the zinc performs more voltaic duty 1128 1129 but all the destruction which takes place with the ordinary forms of battery between the experiments is prevented this saving is of such extent that i estimate the zinc in the new form of battery to be thrice as effective as that in the ordinary form vii the importance of this saving of metal is not merely that the value of the zinc is saved but that the battery is much lighter and more manageable and also that the surfaces of the zinc and copper plates may be brought much nearer to each other when the battery is constructed and remain so until it is worn out the latter is a very important advantage 1148 viii again as in consequence of the saving thinner plates will perform the duty of thick ones rolled zinc may be used and i have found rolled zinc superior to cast zinc in action a superiority which i incline to attribute to its greater purity 1144 ix another advantage is obtained in the economy of the acid used which is proportionate to the diminution of the zinc dissolved x the acid also is more easily exhausted and is in such small quantity that there is never any occasion to return an old charge into use the acid of old charges whilst out of use often dissolves portions of copper from the black flocculi usually mingled with it which are derived from the zinc now any portion of copper in solution in the charge does great harm because by the local action of the acid and zinc it tends to precipitate upon the latter and diminish its voltaic efficacy 1145 xi by using a due mixture of nitric and sulphuric acid for the charge 1139 no gas is evolved from the troughs so that a battery of several hundred pairs of plates may without inconvenience be close to the experimenter xii if during a series of experiments the acid becomes exhausted it can be withdrawn and replaced by other acid with the utmost facility and after the experiments are concluded the great advantage of easily washing the plates is at command and it appears to me that in place of making under different circumstances mutual sacrifices of comfort power and economy to obtain a desired end all are at once obtained by dr hares form of trough  1133 but there are some disadvantages which i have not yet had time to overcome though i trust they will finally be conquered one is the extreme difficulty of making a wooden trough constantly watertight under the alternations of wet and dry to which the voltaic instrument is subject to remedy this evil mr newman is now engaged in obtaining porcelain troughs the other disadvantage is a precipitation of copper on the zinc plates it appears to me to depend mainly on the circumstance that the papers between the coppers retain acid when the trough is emptied and that this acid slowly acting on the copper forms a salt which gradually mingles with the next charge and is reduced on the zinc plate by the local action 1120 the power of the whole battery is then reduced i expect that by using slips of glass or wood to separate the coppers at their edges their contact can be sufficiently prevented and the space between them be left so open that the acid of a charge can be poured and washed out and so be removed from every part of the trough when the experiments in which the latter is used are completed  1134 the actual superiority of the troughs which i have constructed on this plan i believe to depend first and principally on the closer approximation of the zinc and copper surfacesin my troughs they are only onetenth of an inch apart 1148and next on the superior quality of the rolled zinc above the cast zinc used in the construction of the ordinary pile it cannot be that insulation between the contiguous coppers is a disadvantage but i do not find that it is any advantage for when with both the forty pairs of threeinch plates and the twenty pairs of fourinch plates i used papers wellsoaked in waxa these being so large that when folded at the edges they wrapped over each other so as to make cells as insulating as those of the porcelain troughs still no sensible advantage in the chemical action was obtained    a a single paper thus prepared could insulate the electricity of a   trough of forty pairs of plates  1135 as upon principle there must be a discharge of part of the electricity from the edges of the zinc and copper plates at the sides of the trough i should prefer and intend having troughs constructed with a plate or plates of crown glass at the sides of the trough the bottom will need none though to glaze that and the ends would be no disadvantage the plates need not be fastened in but only set in their places nor need they be in large single pieces   § 17 some practical results

gaylussac and thenard and given in the first fortyfive pages of their recherches physicochimiques although the following results are generally of the same nature yet the advancement made in this branch of science of late years the knowledge of the definite action of electricity and the more accurate and philosophical mode of estimating the results by the equivalents of zinc consumed will be their sufficient justification  1137 nature and strength of the acidmy battery of forty pairs of threeinch plates was charged with acid consisting of 200 parts water and 9 oil of vitriol each plate lost in the average of the experiments 466 equivalents of zinc for the equivalent of water decomposed in the voltaelectrometer or the whole battery 1864 equivalents of zinc being charged with a mixture of 200 water and 16 of the muriatic acid each plate lost 38 equivalents of zinc for the water decomposed or the whole battery 152 equivalents of zinc being charged with a mixture of 200 water and 8 nitric acid each plate lost 185 equivalents of zinc for one equivalent of water decomposed or the whole battery 7416 equivalents of zinc the sulphuric and muriatic acids evolved much hydrogen at the plates in the trough the nitric acid no gas whatever the relative strengths of the original acids have already been given 1127 but a difference in that respect makes no important difference in the results when thus expressed by equivalents 1140  1138 thus nitric acid proves to be the best for this purpose its superiority appears to depend upon its favouring the electrolyzation of the liquid in the cells of the trough upon the principles already explained 905 973 1022 and consequently favouring the transmission of the electricity and therefore the production of transferable power 1120  1139 the addition of nitric acid might consequently be expected to improve sulphuric and muriatic acids accordingly when the same trough was charged with a mixture of 200 water 9 oil of vitriol and 4 nitric acid the consumption of zinc was at each plate 2786 and for the whole battery 1115 equivalents when the charge was 200 water 9 oil of vitriol and 8 nitric acid the loss per plate was 226 or for the whole battery 904 equivalents when the trough was charged with a mixture of 200 water 16 muriatic acid and 6 nitric acid the loss per plate was 211 or for the whole battery 844 equivalents similar results were obtained with my battery of twenty pairs of fourinch plates 1129 hence it is evident that the nitric acid was of great service when mingled with the sulphuric acid and the charge generally used after this time for ordinary experiments consisted of 200 water 412 oil of vitriol and 4 nitric acid  1140 it is not to be supposed that the different strengths of the acids produced the differences above for within certain limits i found the electrolytic effects to be nearly as the strengths of the acids so as to leave the expression of force when given in equivalents almost constant thus when the trough was charged with a mixture of 200 water and 8 nitric acid each plate lost 1854 equivalent of zinc when the charge was 200 water and 16 nitric acid the loss per plate was 182 equivalent when it was 200 water and 32 nitric acid the loss was 21 equivalents the differences here are not greater than happen from unavoidable irregularities depending on other causes than the strength of acid  1141 again when a charge consisting of 200 water 412 oil of vitriol and 4 nitric acid was used each zinc plate lost 216 equivalents when the charge with the same battery was 200 water 9 oil of vitriol and 8 nitric acid each zinc plate lost 226 equivalents  1142 i need hardly say that no copper is dissolved during the regular action of the voltaic trough i have found that much ammonia is formed in the cells when nitric acid either pure or mixed with sulphuric acid is used it is produced in part as a secondary result at the cathodes 663 of the different portions of fluid constituting the necessary electrolyte in the cells  1143 uniformity of the chargethis is a most important point as i have already shown experimentally 1042 c hence one great advantage of dr hares mechanical arrangement of his trough  1144 purity of the zincif pure zinc could be obtained it would be very advantageous in the construction of the voltaic apparatus 998 most zincs when put into dilute sulphuric acid leave more or less of an insoluble matter upon the surface in the form of a crust which contains various metals as copper lead zinc iron cadmium c in the metallic state such particles by discharging part of the transferable power render it as to the whole battery local and so diminish the effect as an indication connected with the more or less perfect action of the battery i may mention that no gas ought to rise from the zinc plates the more gas which is generated upon these surfaces the greater is the local action and the less the transferable force the investing crust is also inconvenient by preventing the displacement and renewal of the charge upon the surface of the zinc such zinc as dissolving in the cleanest manner in a dilute acid dissolves also the slowest is the best zinc which contains much copper should especially be avoided i have generally found rolled liege or mosselmans zinc the purest and to the circumstance of having used such zinc in its construction attribute in part the advantage of the new battery 1134  1145 foulness of the zinc platesafter use the plates of a battery should be cleaned from the metallic powder upon their surfaces especially if they are employed to obtain the laws of action of the battery itself this precaution was always attended to with the porcelain trough batteries in the experiments described 1125 c if a few foul plates are mingled with many clean ones they make the action in the different cells irregular and the transferable power is accordingly diminished whilst the local and wasted power is increased no old charge containing copper should be used to excite a battery  1146 new and old platesi have found voltaic batteries far more powerful when the plates were new than when they have been used two or three times so that a new and an used battery cannot be compared together or even a battery with itself on the first and after times of use my trough of twenty pairs of fourinch plates charged with acid consisting of 200 water 412 oil of vitriol and 4 nitric acid lost upon the first time of being used 282 equivalents per plate when used after the fourth time with the same charge the loss was from 326 to 447 equivalents per plate the average being 37 equivalents the first time the forty pair of plates 1124 were used the loss at each plate was only 165 equivalent but afterwards it became 216 217 252 the first time twenty pair of fourinch plates in porcelain troughs were used they lost per plate only 37 equivalents but after that the loss was 525 536 59 equivalents yet in all these cases the zincs had been wellcleaned from adhering copper c before each trial of power  1147 with the rolled zinc the fall in force soon appeared to become constant ie to proceed no further but with the cast zinc plates belonging to the porcelain troughs it appeared to continue until at last with the same charge each plate lost above twice as much zinc for a given amount of action as at first these troughs were however so irregular that i could not always determine the circumstances affecting the amount of electrolytic action  1148 vicinity of the copper and zincthe importance of this point in the construction of voltaic arrangements and the greater power as to immediate action which is obtained when the zinc and copper surfaces are near to each other than when removed further apart are well known i find that the power is not only greater on the instant but also that the sum of transferable power in relation to the whole sum of chemical action at the plates is much increased the cause of this gain is very evident whatever tends to retard the circulation of the transferable force ie the electricity diminishes the proportion of such force and increases the proportion of that which is local 996 1120 now the liquid in the cells possesses this retarding power and therefore acts injuriously in greater or less proportion according to the quantity of it between the zinc and copper plates ie according to the distances between their surfaces a trough therefore in which the plates are only half the distance asunder at which they are placed in another will produce more transferable and less local force than the latter and thus because the electrolyte in the cells can transmit the current more readily both the intensity and quantity of electricity is increased for a given consumption of zinc to this circumstance mainly i attribute the superiority of the trough i have described 1134  1149 the superiority of double coppers over single plates also depends in part upon diminishing the resistance offered by the electrolyte between the metals for in fact with double coppers the sectional area of the interposed acid becomes nearly double that with single coppers and therefore it more freely transfers the electricity double coppers are however effective mainly because they virtually double the acting surface of the zinc or nearly so for in a trough with single copper plates and the usual construction of cells that surface of zinc which is not opposed to a copper surface is thrown almost entirely out of voltaic action yet the acid continues to act upon it and the metal is dissolved producing very little more than local effect 947 996 but when by doubling the copper that metal is opposed to the second surface of the zinc plate then a great part of the action upon the latter is converted into transferable force and thus the power of the trough as to quantity of electricity is highly exalted  1150 first immersion of the platesthe great effect produced at the first immersion of the plates apart from their being new or used 1146 i have attributed elsewhere to the unchanged condition of the acid in contact with the zinc plate 1003 1037 as the acid becomes neutralized its exciting power is proportionally diminished hares form of trough secures much advantage of this kind by mingling the liquid and bringing what may be considered as a fresh surface of acid against the plates every time it is used immediately after a rest  1151 number of platesathe most advantageous number of plates in a battery used for chemical decomposition depends almost entirely upon the resistance to be overcome at the place of action but whatever that resistance may be there is a certain number which is more economical than either a greater or a less ten pairs of fourinch plates in a porcelain trough of the ordinary construction acting in the voltaelectrometer 1126 upon dilute sulphuric acid of spec grav 1314 gave an average consumption of 154 equivalents per plate or 154 equivalents on the whole twenty pairs of the same plates with the same acid gave only a consumption of 55 per plate or 110 equivalents upon the whole when forty pairs of the same plates were used the consumption was 354 equivalents per plate or 1416 upon the whole battery thus the consumption of zinc arranged as twenty plates was more advantageous than if arranged either as ten or as forty    a gaylussac and thenard recherches physicochimiques tom i p 29  1152 again ten pairs of my fourinch plates 1129 lost 676 each or the whole ten 676 equivalents of zinc in effecting decomposition whilst twenty pairs of the same plates excited by the same acid lost 37 equivalents each or on the whole 74 equivalents in other comparative experiments of numbers ten pairs of the three inchplates 1125 lost 3725 or 3725 equivalents upon the whole whilst twenty pairs lost 253 each or 506 in all and forty pairs lost on an average 221 or 884 altogether in both these cases therefore increase of numbers had not been advantageous as to the effective production of transferable chemical power from the whole quantity of chemical force active at the surfaces of excitation 1120  1153 but if i had used a weaker acid or a worse conductor in the voltaelectrometer then the number of plates which would produce the most advantageous effect would have risen or if i had used a better conductor than that really employed in the voltaelectrometer i might have reduced the number even to one as for instance when a thick wire is used to complete the circuit 865 c and the cause of these variations is very evident when it is considered that each successive plate in the voltaic apparatus does not add anything to the quantity of transferable power or electricity which the first plate can put into motion provided a good conductor be present but tends only to exalt the intensity of that quantity so as to make it more able to overcome the obstruction of bad conductors 994 1158  1154 large or small platesathe advantageous use of large or small plates for electrolyzations will evidently depend upon the facility with which the transferable power of electricity can pass if in a particular case the most effectual number of plates is known 1151 then the addition of more zinc would be most advantageously made in increasing the size of the plates and not their number at the same time large increase in the size of the plates would raise in a small degree the most favourable number    a gaylussac and thenard recherches physicochimiques tom i p 20  1155 large and small plates should not be used together in the same battery the small ones occasion a loss of the power of the large ones unless they be excited by an acid proportionably more powerful for with a certain acid they cannot transmit the same portion of electricity in a given time which the same acid can evolve by action on the larger plates  1156 simultaneous decompositionswhen the number of plates in a battery much surpasses the most favourable proportion 11511153 two or more decompositions may be effected simultaneously with advantage thus my forty pairs of plates 1124 produced in one voltaelectrometer 228 cubic inches of gas being recharged exactly in the same manner they produced in each of two voltaelectrometers 21 cubical inches in the first experiment the whole consumption of zinc was 884 equivalents and in the second only 4828 equivalents for the whole of the water decomposed in both voltaelectrometers  1157 but when the twenty pairs of fourinch plates 1129 were tried in a similar manner the results were in the opposite direction with one voltaelectrometer 52 cubic inches of gas were obtained with two only 146 cubic inches from each the quantity of charge was not the same in both cases though it was of the same strength but on rendering the results comparative by reducing them to equivalents 1126 it was found that the consumption of metal in the first case was 74 and in the second case 97 equivalents for the whole of the water decomposed these results of course depend upon the same circumstances of retardation c which have been referred to in speaking of the proper number of plates 1151  1158 that the transferring or as it is usually called conducting power of an electrolyte which is to be decomposed or other interposed body should be rendered as good as possiblea is very evident 1020 1120 with a perfectly good conductor and a good battery nearly all the electricity is passed ie nearly all the chemical power becomes transferable even with a single pair of plates 807 with an interposed nonconductor none of the chemical power becomes transferable with an imperfect conductor more or less of the chemical power becomes transferable as the circumstances favouring the transfer of forces across the imperfect conductor are exalted or diminished these circumstances are actual increase or improvement of the conducting power enlargement of the electrodes approximation of the electrodes and increased intensity of the passing current    a gaylussac and thenard recherches physicochimiques tom i pp   13 15 22  1159 the introduction of common spring water in place of one of the voltaelectrometers used with twenty pairs of fourinch plates 1156 caused such obstruction as not to allow onefifteenth of the transferable force to pass which would have circulated without it thus fourteenfifteenths of the available force of the battery were destroyed local force which was rendered evident by the evolution of gas from the being converted into zincs and yet the platina electrodes in the water were three inches long nearly an inch wide and not a quarter of an inch apart  1160 these points ie the increase of conducting power the enlargement of the electrodes and their approximation should be especially attended to in voltaelectrometers the principles upon which their utility depend are so evident that there can be no occasion for further development of them here  royal institution october 11 1834     eleventh series  § 18 on induction ¶ i induction an action of contiguous particles ¶ ii absolute charge of matter ¶ iii electrometer and inductive apparatus employed ¶ iv induction in curved lines ¶ v specific inductive capacity ¶ vi general results as to induction  received november 30read december 21 1837   ¶ i induction an action of contiguous particles   1161 the science of electricity is in that state in which every part of it requires experimental investigation not merely for the discovery of new effects but what is just now of far more importance the development of the means by which the old effects are produced and the consequent more accurate determination of the first principles of action of the most extraordinary and universal power in natureand to those philosophers who pursue the inquiry zealously yet cautiously combining experiment with analogy suspicious of their preconceived notions paying more respect to a fact than a theory not too hasty to generalize and above all things willing at every step to crossexamine their own opinions both by reasoning and experiment no branch of knowledge can afford so fine and ready a field for discovery as this such is most abundantly shown to be the case by the progress which electricity has made in the last thirty years chemistry and magnetism have successively acknowledged its overruling influence and it is probable that every effect depending upon the powers of inorganic matter and perhaps most of those related to vegetable and animal life will ultimately be found subordinate to it  1162 amongst the actions of different kinds into which electricity has conventionally been subdivided there is i think none which excels or even equals in importance that called induction it is of the most general influence in electrical phenomena appearing to be concerned in every one of them and has in reality the character of a first essential and fundamental principle its comprehension is so important that i think we cannot proceed much further in the investigation of the laws of electricity without a more thorough understanding of its nature how otherwise can we hope to comprehend the harmony and even unity of action which doubtless governs electrical excitement by friction by chemical means by heat by magnetic influence by evaporation and even by the living being  1163 in the longcontinued course of experimental inquiry in which i have been engaged this general result has pressed upon me constantly namely the necessity of admitting two forces or two forms or directions of a force 516 517 combined with the impossibility of separating these two forces or electricities from each other either in the phenomena of statical electricity or those of the current in association with this the impossibility under any circumstances as yet of absolutely charging matter of any kind with one or the other electricity only dwelt on my mind and made me wish and search for a clearer view than any that i was acquainted with of the way in which electrical powers and the particles of matter are related especially in inductive actions upon which almost all others appeared to rest  1164 when i discovered the general fact that electrolytes refused to yield their elements to a current when in the solid state though they gave them forth freely if in the liquid condition 380 394 402 i thought i saw an opening to the elucidation of inductive action and the possible subjugation of many dissimilar phenomena to one law for let the electrolyte be water a plate of ice being coated with platina foil on its two surfaces and these coatings connected with any continued source of the two electrical powers the ice will charge like a leyden arrangement presenting a case of common induction but no current will pass if the ice be liquefied the induction will fall to a certain degree because a current can now pass but its passing is dependent upon a peculiar molecular arrangement of the particles consistent with the transfer of the elements of the electrolyte in opposite directions the degree of discharge and the quantity of elements evolved being exactly proportioned to each other 377 783 whether the charging of the metallic coating be effected by a powerful electrical machine a strong and large voltaic battery or a single pair of plates makes no difference in the principle but only in the degree of action 360 common induction takes place in each case if the electrolyte be solid or if fluid chemical action and decomposition ensue provided opposing actions do not interfere and it is of high importance occasionally thus to compare effects in their extreme degrees for the purpose of enabling us to comprehend the nature of an action in its weak state which may be only sufficiently evident to us in its stronger condition 451 as therefore in the electrolytic action induction appeared to be the first step and decomposition the second the power of separating these steps from each other by giving the solid or fluid condition to the electrolyte being in our hands as the induction was the same in its nature as that through air glass wax c produced by any of the ordinary means and as the whole effect in the electrolyte appeared to be an action of the particles thrown into a peculiar or polarized state i was led to suspect that common induction itself was in all cases an action of contiguous particlesa and that electrical action at a distance ie ordinary inductive action never occurred except through the influence of the intervening matter    a the word contiguous is perhaps not the best that might have been   used here and elsewhere for as particles do not touch each other it   is not strictly correct i was induced to employ it because in its   common acceptation it enabled me to state the theory plainly and with   facility by contiguous particles i mean those which are nextdec   1838  1165 the respect which i entertain towards the names of epinus cavendish poisson and other most eminent men all of whose theories i believe consider induction as an action at a distance and in straight lines long indisposed me to the view i have just stated and though i always watched for opportunities to prove the opposite opinion and made such experiments occasionally as seemed to bear directly on the point as for instance the examination of electrolytes solid and fluid whilst under induction by polarized light 951 955 it is only of late and by degrees that the extreme generality of the subject has urged me still further to extend my experiments and publish my view at present i believe ordinary induction in all cases to be an action of contiguous particles consisting in a species of polarity instead of being an action of either particles or masses at sensible distances and if this be true the distinction and establishment of such a truth must be of the greatest consequence to our further progress in the investigation of the nature of electric forces the linked condition of electrical induction with chemical decomposition of voltaic excitement with chemical action the transfer of elements in an electrolyte the original cause of excitement in all cases the nature and relation of conduction and insulation of the direct and lateral or transverse action constituting electricity and magnetism with many other things more or less incomprehensible at present would all be affected by it and perhaps receive a full explication in their reduction under one general law  1166 i searched for an unexceptionable test of my view not merely in the accordance of known facts with it but in the consequences which would flow from it if true especially in those which would not be consistent with the theory of action at a distance such a consequence seemed to me to present itself in the direction in which inductive action could be exerted if in straight lines only though not perhaps decisive it would be against my view but if in curved lines also that would be a natural result of the action of contiguous particles but as i think utterly incompatible with action at a distance as assumed by the received theories which according to every fact and analogy we are acquainted with is always in straight lines  1167 again if induction be an action of contiguous particles and also the first step in the process of electrolyzation 1164 919 there seemed reason to expect some particular relation of it to the different kinds of matter through which it would be exerted or something equivalent to a specific electric induction for different bodies which if it existed would unequivocally prove the dependence of induction on the particles and though this in the theory of poisson and others has never been supposed to be the case i was soon led to doubt the received opinion and have taken great pains in subjecting this point to close experimental examination  1168 another everpresent question on my mind has been whether electricity has an actual and independent existence as a fluid or fluids or was a mere power of matter like what we conceive of the attraction of gravitation if determined either way it would be an enormous advance in our knowledge and as having the most direct and influential bearing on my notions i have always sought for experiments which would in any way tend to elucidate that great inquiry it was in attempts to prove the existence of electricity separate from matter by giving an independent charge of either positive or negative power only to some one substance and the utter failure of all such attempts whatever substance was used or whatever means of exciting or evolving electricity were employed that first drove me to look upon induction as an action of the particles of matter each having both forces developed in it in exactly equal amount it is this circumstance in connection with others which makes me desirous of placing the remarks on absolute charge first in the order of proof and argument which i am about to adduce in favour of my view that electric induction is an action of the contiguous particles of the insulating medium or dielectrica    a i use the word dielectric to express that substance through or   across which the electric forces are actingdec 1838   ¶ ii on the absolute charge of matter  1169 can matter either conducting or nonconducting be charged with one electric force independently of the other in any degree either in a sensible or latent state  1170 the beautiful experiments of coulomb upon the equality of action of conductors whatever their substance and the residence of all the electricity upon their surfacesa are sufficient if properly viewed to prove that conductors cannot be bodily charged and as yet no means of communicating electricity to a conductor so as to place its particles in relation to one electricity and not at the same time to the other in exactly equal amount has been discovered    a mémoires de lacadémie 1786 pp 67 69 72 1787 p 452  1171 with regard to electrics or nonconductors the conclusion does not at first seem so clear they may easily be electrified bodily either by communication 1247 or excitement but being so charged every case in succession when examined came out to be a case of induction and not of absolute charge thus glass within conductors could easily have parts not in contact with the conductor brought into an excited state but it was always found that a portion of the inner surface of the conductor was in an opposite and equivalent state or that another part of the glass itself was in an equally opposite state an inductive charge and not an absolute charge having been acquired  1172 wellpurified oil of turpentine which i find to be an excellent liquid insulator for most purposes was put into a metallic vessel and being insulated an endeavour was made to charge its particles sometimes by contact of the metal with the electrical machine and at others by a wire dipping into the fluid within but whatever the mode of communication no electricity of one kind only was retained by the arrangement except what appeared on the exterior surface of the metal that portion being present there only by an inductive action through the air to the surrounding conductors when the oil of turpentine was confined in glass vessels there were at first some appearances as if the fluid did receive an absolute charge of electricity from the charging wire but these were quickly reduced to cases of common induction jointly through the fluid the glass and the surrounding air  1173 i carried these experiments on with air to a very great extent i had a chamber built being a cube of twelve feet a slight cubical wooden frame was constructed and copper wire passed along and across it in various directions so as to make the sides a large network and then all was covered in with paper placed in close connexion with the wires and supplied in every direction with bands of tin foil that the whole might be brought into good metallic communication and rendered a free conductor in every part this chamber was insulated in the lectureroom of the royal institution a glass tube about six feet in length was passed through its side leaving about four feet within and two feet on the outside and through this a wire passed from the large electrical machine 290 to the air within by working the machine the air in this chamber could be brought into what is considered a highly electrified state being in fact the same state as that of the air of a room in which a powerful machine is in operation and at the same time the outside of the insulated cube was everywhere strongly charged but putting the chamber in communication with the perfect discharging train described in a former series 292 and working the machine so as to bring the air within to its utmost degree of charge if i quickly cut off the connexion with the machine and at the same moment or instantly after insulated the cube the air within had not the least power to communicate a further charge to it if any portion of the air was electrified as glass or other insulators may be charged 1171 it was accompanied by a corresponding opposite action within the cube the whole effect being merely a case of induction every attempt to charge air bodily and independently with the least portion of either electricity failed  1174 i put a delicate goldleaf electrometer within the cube and then charged the whole by an outside communication very strongly for some time together but neither during the charge or after the discharge did the electrometer or air within show the least signs of electricity i charged and discharged the whole arrangement in various ways but in no case could i obtain the least indication of an absolute charge or of one by induction in which the electricity of one kind had the smallest superiority in quantity over the other i went into the cube and lived in it and using lighted candles electrometers and all other tests of electrical states i could not find the least influence upon them or indication of any thing particular given by them though all the time the outside of the cube was powerfully charged and large sparks and brushes were darting off from every part of its outer surface the conclusion i have come to is that nonconductors as well as conductors have never yet had an absolute and independent charge of one electricity communicated to them and that to all appearance such a state of matter is impossible  1175 there is another view of this question which may be taken under the supposition of the existence of an electric fluid or fluids it may be impossible to have one fluid or state in a free condition without its producing by induction the other and yet possible to have cases in which an isolated portion of matter in one condition being uncharged shall by a change of state evolve one electricity or the other and though such evolved electricity might immediately induce the opposite state in its neighbourhood yet the mere evolution of one electricity without the other in the first instance would be a very important fact in the theories which assume a fluid or fluids these theories as i understand them assigning not the slightest reason why such an effect should not occur  1176 but on searching for such cases i cannot find one evolution by friction as is well known gives both powers in equal proportion so does evolution by chemical action notwithstanding the great diversity of bodies which may be employed and the enormous quantity of electricity which can in this manner be evolved 371 376 861 868 961 the more promising cases of change of state whether by evaporation fusion or the reverse processes still give both forms of the power in equal proportion and the cases of splitting of mica and other crystals the breaking of sulphur c are subject to the same law of limitation  1177 as far as experiment has proceeded it appears therefore impossible either to evolve or make disappear one electric force without equal and corresponding change in the other it is also equally impossible experimentally to charge a portion of matter with one electric force independently of the other charge always implies induction for it can in no instance be effected without and also the presence of the two forms of power equally at the moment of the development and afterwards there is no absolute charge of matter with one fluid no latency of a single electricity this though a negative result is an exceedingly important one being probably the consequence of a natural impossibility which will become clear to us when we understand the true condition and theory of the electric power  1178 the preceding considerations already point to the following conclusions bodies cannot be charged absolutely but only relatively and by a principle which is the same with that of induction all charge is sustained by induction all phenomena of intensity include the principle of induction all excitation is dependent on or directly related to induction all currents involve previous intensity and therefore previous induction induction appears to be the essential function both the first development and the consequent phenomena of electricity   ¶ iii electrometer and inductive apparatus employed  1179 leaving for a time the further consideration of the preceding facts until they can be collated with other results bearing directly on the great question of the nature of induction i will now describe the apparatus i have had occasion to use and in proportion to the importance of the principles sought to be established is the necessity of doing this so clearly as to leave no doubt of the results behind  1180 electrometerthe measuring instrument i have employed has been the torsion balance electrometer of coulomb constructed generally according to his directionsa but with certain variations and additions which i will briefly describe the lower part was a glass cylinder eight inches in height and eight inches in diameter the tube for the torsion thread was seventeen inches in length the torsion thread itself was not of metal but glass according to the excellent suggestion of the late dr ritchieb it was twenty inches in length and of such tenuity that when the shelllac lever and attached ball c were connected with it they made about ten vibrations in a minute it would bear torsion through four revolutions or 1440° and yet when released return accurately to its position probably it would have borne considerably more than this without injury the repelled ball was of pith gilt and was 03 of an inch in diameter the horizontal stem or lever supporting it was of shelllac according to coulombs direction the arm carrying the ball being 24 inches long and the other only 12 inches to this was attached the vane also described by coulomb which i found to answer admirably its purpose of quickly destroying vibrations that the inductive action within the electrometer might be uniform in all positions of the repelled ball and in all states of the apparatus two bands of tin foil about an inch wide each were attached to the inner surface of the glass cylinder going entirely round it at the distance of 04 of an inch from each other and at such a height that the intermediate clear surface was in the same horizontal plane with the lever and ball these bands were connected with each other and with the earth and being perfect conductors always exerted a uniform influence on the electrified balls within which the glass surface from its irregularity of condition at different times i found did not for the purpose of keeping the air within the electrometer in a constant state as to dryness a glass dish of such size as to enter easily within the cylinder had a layer of fused potash placed within it and this being covered with a disc of fine wiregauze to render its inductive action uniform at all parts was placed within the instrument at the bottom and left there    a mémoires de lacadémie 1785 p 570    b philosophical transactions 1830  1181 the moveable ball used to take and measure the portion of electricity under examination and which may be called the repelling or the carrier ball was of soft alder wood well and smoothly gilt it was attached to a fine shelllac stem and introduced through a hole into the electrometer according to coulombs method the stem was fixed at its upper end in a block or vice supported on three short feet and on the surface of the glass cover above was a plate of lead with stops on it so that when the carrier ball was adjusted in its right position with the vice above bearing at the same time against these stops it was perfectly easy to bring away the carrierball and restore it to its place again very accurately without any loss of time  1182 it is quite necessary to attend to certain precautions respecting these balls if of pith alone they are bad for when very dry that substance is so imperfect a conductor that it neither receives nor gives a charge freely and so after contact with a charged conductor it is liable to be in an uncertain condition again it is difficult to turn pith so smooth as to leave the ball even when gilt so free from irregularities of form as to retain its charge undiminished for a considerable length of time when therefore the balls are finally prepared and gilt they should be examined and being electrified unless they can hold their charge with very little diminution for a considerable time and yet be discharged instantly and perfectly by the touch of an uninsulated conductor they should be dismissed  1183 it is perhaps unnecessary to refer to the graduation of the instrument further than to explain how the observations were made on a circle or ring of paper on the outside of the glass cylinder fixed so as to cover the internal lower ring of tinfoil were marked four points corresponding to angles of 90° four other points exactly corresponding to these points being marked on the upper ring of tinfoil within by these and the adjusting screws on which the whole instrument stands the glass torsion thread could be brought accurately into the centre of the instrument and of the graduations on it from one of the four points on the exterior of the cylinder a graduation of 90° was set off and a corresponding graduation was placed upon the upper tinfoil on the opposite side of the cylinder within and a dot being marked on that point of the surface of the repelled ball nearest to the side of the electrometer it was easy by observing the line which this dot made with the lines of the two graduations just referred to to ascertain accurately the position of the ball the upper end of the glass thread was attached as in coulombs original electrometer to an index which had its appropriate graduated circle upon which the degree of torsion was ultimately to be read off  1184 after the levelling of the instrument and adjustment of the glass thread the blocks which determine the place of the carrier ball are to be regulated 1181 so that when the carrier arrangement is placed against them the centre of the ball may be in the radius of the instrument corresponding to 0° on the lower graduation or that on the side of the electrometer and at the same level and distance from the centre as the repelled ball on the suspended torsion lever then the torsion index is to be turned until the ball connected with it the repelled ball is accurately at 30° and finally the graduated arc belonging to the torsion index is to be adjusted so as to bring 0° upon it to the index this state of the instrument was adopted as that which gave the most direct expression of the experimental results and in the form having fewest variable errors the angular distance of 30° being always retained as the standard distance to which the balls were in every case to be brought and the whole of the torsion being read off at once on the graduated circle above under these circumstances the distance of the balls from each other was not merely the same in degree but their position in the instrument and in relation to every part of it was actually the same every time that a measurement was made so that all irregularities arising from slight difference of form and action in the instrument and the bodies around were avoided the only difference which could occur in the position of anything within consisted in the deflexion of the torsion thread from a vertical position more or less according to the force of repulsion of the balls but this was so slight as to cause no interfering difference in the symmetry of form within the instrument and gave no error in the amount of torsion force indicated on the graduation above  1185 although the constant angular distance of 30° between the centres of the balls was adopted and found abundantly sensible for all ordinary purposes yet the facility of rendering the instrument far more sensible by diminishing this distance was at perfect command the results at different distances being very easily compared with each other either by experiment or as they are inversely as the squares of the distances by calculation  1186 the coulomb balance electrometer requires experience to be understood but i think it a very valuable instrument in the hands of those who will take pains by practice and attention to learn the precautions needful in its use its insulating condition varies with circumstances and should be examined before it is employed in experiments in an ordinary and fair condition when the balls were so electrified as to give a repulsive torsion force of 100° at the standard distance of 30° it took nearly four hours to sink to 50° at the same distance the average loss from 400° to 300° being at the rate of 2°7 per minute from 300° to 200° of 1°7 per minute from 200° to 100° of 1°3 per minute and from 100° to 50° of 0°87 per minute as a complete measurement by the instrument may be made in much less than a minute the amount of loss in that time is but small and can easily be taken into account  1187 the inductive apparatusmy object was to examine inductive action carefully when taking place through different media for which purpose it was necessary to subject these media to it in exactly similar circumstances and in such quantities as should suffice to eliminate any variations they might present the requisites of the apparatus to be constructed were therefore that the inducing surfaces of the conductors should have a constant form and state and be at a constant distance from each other and that either solids fluids or gases might be placed and retained between these surfaces with readiness and certainty and for any length of time  1188 the apparatus used may be described in general terms as consisting of two metallic spheres of unequal diameter placed the smaller within the larger and concentric with it the interval between the two being the space through which the induction was to take place a section of it is given plate vii fig 104 on a scale of onehalf a a are the two halves of a brass sphere with an airtight joint at b like that of the magdeburg hemispheres made perfectly flush and smooth inside so as to present no irregularity c is a connecting piece by which the apparatus is joined to a good stopcock d which is itself attached either to the metallic foot e or to an airpump the aperture within the hemisphere at f is very small g is a brass collar fitted to the upper hemisphere through which the shelllac support of the inner ball and its stem passes h is the inner ball also of brass it screws on to a brass stem i terminated above by a brass ball b l l is a mass of shelllac moulded carefully on to i and serving both to support and insulate it and its balls h b the shelllac stem l is fitted into the socket g by a little ordinary resinous cement more fusible than shelllac applied at mm in such a way as to give sufficient strength and render the apparatus airtight there yet leave as much as possible of the lower part of the shelllac stem untouched as an insulation between the ball h and the surrounding sphere a a the ball h has a small aperture at n so that when the apparatus is exhausted of one gas and filled with another the ball h may itself also be exhausted and filled that no variation of the gas in the interval o may occur during the course of an experiment  1189 it will be unnecessary to give the dimensions of all the parts since the drawing is to a scale of onehalf the inner ball has a diameter 233 inches and the surrounding sphere an internal diameter of 357 inches hence the width of the intervening space through which the induction is to take place is 062 of an inch and the extent of this place or plate ie the surface of a medium sphere may be taken as twentyseven square inches a quantity considered as sufficiently large for the comparison of different substances great care was taken in finishing well the inducing surfaces of the ball h and sphere a a and no varnish or lacquer was applied to them or to any part of the metal of the apparatus  1190 the attachment and adjustment of the shelllac stem was a matter requiring considerable care especially as in consequence of its cracking it had frequently to be renewed the best lac was chosen and applied to the wire i so as to be in good contact with it everywhere and in perfect continuity throughout its own mass it was not smaller than is given by scale in the drawing for when less it frequently cracked within a few hours after it was cold i think that very slow cooling or annealing improved its quality in this respect the collar g was made as thin as could be that the lac might be as wide there as possible in order that at every reattachment of the stem to the upper hemisphere the ball h might have the same relative position a gauge p fig 105 was made of wood and this being applied to the ball and hemisphere whilst the cement at m was still soft the bearings of the ball at qq and the hemisphere at rr were forced home and the whole left until cold thus all difficulty in the adjustment of the ball in the sphere was avoided  1191 i had occasion at first to attach the stem to the socket by other means as a band of paper or a plugging of white silk thread but these were very inferior to the cement interfering much with the insulating power of the apparatus  1192 the retentive power of this apparatus was when in good condition better than that of the electrometer 1186 ie the proportion of loss of power was less thus when the apparatus was electrified and also the balls in the electrometer to such a degree that after the inner ball had been in contact with the top k of the ball of the apparatus it caused a repulsion indicated by 600° of torsion force then in falling from 600° to 400° the average loss was 8°6 per minute from 400° to 300° the average loss was 2°6 per minute from 300° to 200° it was 1°7 per minute from 200° to 170° it was 1° per minute this was after the apparatus had been charged for a short time at the first instant of charging there is an apparent loss of electricity which can only be comprehended hereafter 1207 1250  1193 when the apparatus loses its insulating power suddenly it is almost always from a crack near to or within the brass socket these cracks are usually transverse to the stem if they occur at the part attached by common cement to the socket the air cannot enter and thus constituting vacua they conduct away the electricity and lower the charge as fast almost as if a piece of metal had been introduced there occasionally stems in this state being taken out and cleared from the common cement may by the careful application of the heat of a spiritlamp be so far softened and melted as to restore the perfect continuity of the parts but if that does not succeed in replacing things in a good condition the remedy is a new shelllac stem  1194 the apparatus when in order could easily be exhausted of air and filled with any given gas but when that gas was acid or alkaline it could not properly be removed by the airpump and yet required to be perfectly cleared away in such cases the apparatus was opened and emptied of gas and with respect to the inner ball h it was washed out two or three times with distilled water introduced at the screwhole and then being heated above 212° air was blown through to render the interior perfectly dry  1195 the inductive apparatus described is evidently a leyden phial with the advantage however of having the dielectric or insulating medium changed at pleasure the balls h and b with the connecting wire i constitute the charged conductor upon the surface of which all the electric force is resident by virtue of induction 1178 now though the largest portion of this induction is between the ball h and the surrounding sphere aa yet the wire i and the ball b determine a part of the induction from their surfaces towards the external surrounding conductors still as all things in that respect remain the same whilst the medium within at oo may be varied any changes exhibited by the whole apparatus will in such cases depend upon the variations made in the interior and these were the changes i was in search of the negation or establishment of such differences being the great object of my inquiry i considered that these differences if they existed would be most distinctly set forth by having two apparatus of the kind described precisely similar in every respect and then different insulating media being within to charge one and measure it and after dividing the charge with the other to observe what the ultimate conditions of both were if insulating media really had any specific differences in favouring or opposing inductive action through them such differences i conceived could not fail of being developed by such a process  1196 i will wind up this description of the apparatus and explain the precautions necessary to their use by describing the form and order of the experiments made to prove their equality when both contained common air in order to facilitate reference i will distinguish the two by the terms app i and app ii  1197 the electrometer is first to be adjusted and examined 1184 and the app i and ii are to be perfectly discharged a leyden phial is to be charged to such a degree that it would give a spark of about onesixteenth or onetwentieth of an inch in length between two balls of half an inch diameter and the carrier ball of the electrometer being charged by this phial is to be introduced into the electrometer and the lever ball brought by the motion of the torsion index against it the charge is thus divided between the balls and repulsion ensues it is useful then to bring the repelled ball to the standard distance of 30° by the motion of the torsion index and observe the force in degrees required for this purpose this force will in future experiments be called repulsion of the balls  1198 one of the inductive apparatus as for instance app i is now to be charged from the leyden phial the latter being in the state it was in when used to charge the balls the carrier ball is to be brought into contact with the top of its upper ball k fig 104 then introduced into the electrometer and the repulsive force at the distance of 30° measured again the carrier should be applied to the app i and the measurement repeated the apparatus i and ii are then to be joined so as to divide the charge and afterwards the force of each measured by the carrier ball applied as before and the results carefully noted after this both i and ii are to be discharged then app ii charged measured divided with app i and the force of each again measured and noted if in each case the half charges of app i and ii are equal and are together equal to the whole charge before division then it may be considered as proved that the two apparatus are precisely equal in power and fit to be used in cases of comparison between different insulating media or dielectrics  1199 but the precautions necessary to obtain accurate results are numerous the apparatus i and ii must always be placed on a thoroughly uninsulating medium a mahogany table for instance is far from satisfactory in this respect and therefore a sheet of tinfoil connected with an extensive discharging train 292 is what i have used they must be so placed also as not to be too near each other and yet equally exposed to the inductive influence of surrounding objects and these objects again should not be disturbed in their position during an experiment or else variations of induction upon the external ball b of the apparatus may occur and so errors be introduced into the results the carrier ball when receiving its portion of electricity from the apparatus should always be applied at the same part of the ball as for instance the summit k and always in the same way variable induction from the vicinity of the head hands c being avoided and the ball after contact being withdrawn upwards in a regular and constant manner  1200 as the stem had occasionally to be changed 1190 and the change might occasion slight variations in the position of the ball within i made such a variation purposely to the amount of an eighth of an inch which is far more than ever could occur in practice but did not find that it sensibly altered the relation of the apparatus or its inductive condition as a whole another trial of the apparatus was made as to the effect of dampness in the air one being filled with very dry air and the other with air from over water though this produced no change in the result except an occasional tendency to more rapid dissipation yet the precaution was always taken when working with gases 1290 to dry them perfectly  1201 it is essential that the interior of the apparatus should be perfectly free from dust or small loose particles for these very rapidly lower the charge and interfere on occasions when their presence and action would hardly be expected to breathe on the interior of the apparatus and wipe it out quietly with a clean silk handkerchief is an effectual way of removing them but then the intrusion of other particles should be carefully guarded against and a dusty atmosphere should for this and several other reasons be avoided  1202 the shelllac stem requires occasionally to be wellwiped to remove in the first instance the film of wax and adhering matter which is upon it and afterwards to displace dirt and dust which will gradually attach to it in the course of experiments i have found much to depend upon this precaution and a silk handkerchief is the best wiper  1203 but wiping and some other circumstances tend to give a charge to the surface of the shelllac stem this should be removed for if allowed to remain it very seriously affects the degree of charge given to the carrier ball by the apparatus 1232 this condition of the stem is best observed by discharging the apparatus applying the carrier ball to the stem touching it with the finger insulating and removing it and examining whether it has received any charge by induction from the stem if it has the stem itself is in a charged state the best method of removing the charge i have found to be to cover the finger with a single fold of a silk handkerchief and breathing on the stem to wipe it immediately after with the finger the ball b and its connected wire c being at the same time uninsulated the wiping place of the silk must not be changed it then becomes sufficiently damp not to excite the stem and is yet dry enough to leave it in a clean and excellent insulating condition if the air be dusty it will be found that a single charge of the apparatus will bring on an electric state of the outside of the stem in consequence of the carrying power of the particles of dust whereas in the morning and in a room which has been left quiet several experiments can be made in succession without the stem assuming the least degree of charge  1204 experiments should not be made by candle or lamp light except with much care for flames have great and yet unsteady powers of affecting and dissipating electrical charges  1205 as a final observation on the state of the apparatus they should retain their charges well and uniformly and alike for both and at the same time allow of a perfect and instantaneous discharge giving afterwards no charge to the carrier ball whatever part of the ball b it may be applied to 1218  1206 with respect to the balance electrometer all the precautions that need be mentioned are that the carrier ball is to be preserved during the first part of an experiment in its electrified state the loss of electricity which would follow upon its discharge being avoided and that in introducing it into the electrometer through the hole in the glass plate above care should be taken that it do not touch or even come near to the edge of the glass  1207 when the whole charge in one apparatus is divided between the two the gradual fall apparently from dissipation in the apparatus which has received the half charge is greater than in the one originally charged this is due to a peculiar effect to be described hereafter 1250 1251 the interfering influence of which may be avoided to a great extent by going through the steps of the process regularly and quickly therefore after the original charge has been measured in app i for instance i and ii are to be symmetrically joined by their balls b the carrier touching one of these balls at the same time it is first to be removed and then the apparatus separated from each other app ii is next quickly to be measured by the carrier then app i lastly ii is to be discharged and the discharged carrier applied to it to ascertain whether any residual effect is present 1205 and app i being discharged is also to be examined in the same manner and for the same purpose  1208 the following is an example of the division of a charge by the two apparatus air being the dielectric in both of them the observations are set down one under the other in the order in which they were taken the lefthand numbers representing the observations made on app i and the righthand numbers those on app ii app i is that which was originally charged and after two measurements the charge was divided with app ii  app i    app ii      balls 160°              0° 254°      250       divided and instantly taken           122 124         1           after being discharged             2 after being discharged  1209 without endeavouring to allow for the loss which must have been gradually going on during the time of the experiment let us observe the results of the numbers as they stand as 1° remained in app i in an undischargeable state 249° may be taken as the utmost amount of the transferable or divisible charge the half of which is 124°5 as app ii was free of charge in the first instance and immediately after the division was found with 122° this amount at least may be taken as what it had received on the other hand 124° minus 1° or 123° may be taken as the half of the transferable charge retained by app i now these do not differ much from each other or from 124°5 the half of the full amount of transferable charge and when the gradual loss of charge evident in the difference between 254° and 250° of app i is also taken into account there is every reason to admit the result as showing an equal division of charge unattended by any disappearance of power except that due to dissipation  1210 i will give another result in which app ii was first charged and where the residual action of that apparatus was greater than in the former case  app i    app ii      balls 150°            152°           148 divided and instantly taken   70°                78             5 immediately after discharge    0          immediately after discharge  1211 the transferable charge being 148°  5° its half is 71°5 which is not far removed from 70° the half charge of i or from 73° the half charge of ii these half charges again making up the sum of 143° or just the amount of the whole transferable charge considering the errors of experiment therefore these results may again be received as showing that the apparatus were equal in inductive capacity or in their powers of receiving charges  1212 the experiments were repeated with charges of negative electricity with the same general results  1213 that i might be sure of the sensibility and action of the apparatus i made such a change in one as ought upon principle to increase its inductive force ie i put a metallic lining into the lower hemisphere of app i so as to diminish the thickness of the intervening air in that part from 062 to 0435 of an inch this lining was carefully shaped and rounded so that it should not present a sudden projection within at its edge but a gradual transition from the reduced interval in the lower part of the sphere to the larger one in the upper  1214 this change immediately caused app i to produce effects indicating that it had a greater aptness or capacity for induction than app ii thus when a transferable charge in app ii of 469° was divided with app i the former retained a charge of 225° whilst the latter showed one of 227° ie the former had lost 244° in communicating 227° to the latter on the other hand when app i had a transferable charge in it of 381° divided by contact with app ii it lost 181° only whilst it gave to app ii as many as 194the sum of the divided forces being in the first instance less and in the second instance greater than the original undivided charge these results are the more striking as only onehalf of the interior of app i was modified and they show that the instruments are capable of bringing out differences in inductive force from amongst the errors of experiment when these differences are much less than that produced by the alteration made in the present instance   ¶ iv induction in curved lines  1215 amongst those results deduced from the molecular view of induction 1166 which being of a peculiar nature are the best tests of the truth or error of the theory the expected action in curved lines is i think the most important at present for if shown to take place in an unexceptionable manner i do not see how the old theory of action at a distance and in straight lines can stand or how the conclusion that ordinary induction is an action of contiguous particles can be resisted  1216 there are many forms of old experiments which might be quoted as favourable to and consistent with the view i have adopted such are most cases of electrochemical decomposition electrical brushes auras sparks c but as these might be considered equivocal evidence inasmuch as they include a current and discharge though they have long been to me indications of prior molecular action 1230 i endeavoured to devise such experiments for first proofs as should not include transfer but relate altogether to the pure simple inductive action of statical electricity  1217 it was also of importance to make these experiments in the simplest possible manner using not more than one insulating medium or dielectric at a time lest differences of slow conduction should produce effects which might erroneously be supposed to result from induction in curved lines it will be unnecessary to describe the steps of the investigation minutely i will at once proceed to the simplest mode of proving the facts first in air and then in other insulating media  1218 a cylinder of solid shelllac 09 of an inch in diameter and seven inches in length was fixed upright in a wooden foot fig 106 it was made concave or cupped at its upper extremity so that a brass ball or other small arrangement could stand upon it the upper half of the stem having been excited negatively by friction with warm flannel a brass ball b 1 inch in diameter was placed on the top and then the whole arrangement examined by the carrier ball and coulombs electrometer 1180 c for this purpose the balls of the electrometer were charged positively to about 360° and then the carrier being applied to various parts of the ball b the two were uninsulated whilst in contact or in position then insulateda separated and the charge of the carrier examined as to its nature and force its electricity was always positive and its force at the different positions a b c d c figs 106 and 107 observed in succession was as follows  at a        above 1000°    b it was        149    c               270    d               512    b               130    a it can hardly be necessary for me to say here that whatever   general state the carrier ball acquired in any place where it was   uninsulated and then insulated it retained on removal from that   place notwithstanding that it might pass through other places that   would have given to it if uninsulated a different condition  1219 to comprehend the full force of these results it must first be understood that all the charges of the ball b and the carrier are charges by induction from the action of the excited surface of the shelllac cylinder for whatever electricity the ball b received by communication from the shelllac either in the first instance or afterwards was removed by the uninsulating contacts only that due to induction remaining and this is shown by the charges taken from the ball in this its uninsulated state being always positive or of the contrary character to the electricity of the shelllac in the next place the charges at a c and d were of such a nature as might be expected from an inductive action in straight lines but that obtained at b is not so it is clearly a charge by induction but induction in a curved line for the carrier ball whilst applied to b and after its removal to a distance of six inches or more from b could not in consequence of the size of b be connected by a straight line with any part of the excited and inducing shelllac  1220 to suppose that the upper part of the uninsulated ball b should in some way be retained in an electrified state by that portion of the surface of the ball which is in sight of the shelllac would be in opposition to what we know already of the subject electricity is retained upon the surface of conductors only by induction 1178 and though some persons may not be prepared as yet to admit this with respect to insulated conductors all will as regards uninsulated conductors like the ball b and to decide the matter we have only to place the carrier ball at e fig 107 so that it shall not come in contact with b uninsulate it by a metallic rod descending perpendicularly insulate it remove it and examine its state it will be found charged with the same kind of electricity as and even to a higher degree 1224 than if it had been in contact with the summit of b  1221 to suppose again that induction acts in some way through or across the metal of the ball is negatived by the simplest considerations but a fact in proof will be better if instead of the ball b a small disc of metal be used the carrier may be charged at or above the middle of its upper surface but if the plate be enlarged to about 112 or 2 inches in diameter c fig 108 then no charge will be given to the carrier at f though when applied nearer to the edge at g or even above the middle at h a charge will be obtained and this is true though the plate may be a mere thin film of goldleaf hence it is clear that the induction is not through the metal but through the surrounding air or dielectric and that in curved lines  1222 i had another arrangement in which a wire passing downwards through the middle of the shelllac cylinder to the earth was connected with the ball b fig 109 so as to keep it in a constantly uninsulated state this was a very convenient form of apparatus and the results with it were the same as those just described  1223 in another case the ball b was supported by a shelllac stem independently of the excited cylinder of shelllac and at half an inch distance from it but the effects were the same then the brass ball of a charged leyden jar was used in place of the excited shelllac to produce induction but this caused no alteration of the phenomena both positive and negative inducing charges were tried with the same general results finally the arrangement was inverted in the air for the purpose of removing every possible objection to the conclusions but they came out exactly the same  1224 some results obtained with a brass hemisphere instead of the ball b were exceedingly interesting it was 136 of an inch in diameter fig 110 and being placed on the top of the excited shelllac cylinder the carrier ball was applied as in the former experiments 1218 at the respective positions delineated in the figure at i the force was 112° at k 108° at l 65° at m 35° the inductive force gradually diminishing as might have been expected to this point but on raising the carrier to the position n the charge increased to 87° and on raising it still higher to o the charge still further increased to 105° at a higher point still p the charge taken was smaller in amount being 98° and continued to diminish for more elevated positions here the induction fairly turned a corner nothing in fact can better show both the curved lines or courses of the inductive action disturbed as they are from their rectilineal form by the shape position and condition of the metallic hemisphere and also a lateral tension so to speak of these lines on one anotherall depending as i conceive on induction being an action of the contiguous particles of the dielectric which being thrown into a state of polarity and tension are in mutual relation by their forces in all directions  1225 as another proof that the whole of these actions were inductive i may state a result which was exactly what might be expected namely that if uninsulated conducting matter was brought round and near to the excited shelllac stem then the inductive force was directed towards it and could not be found on the top of the hemisphere removing this matter the lines of force resumed their former direction the experiment affords proofs of the lateral tension of these lines and supplies a warning to remove such matter in repeating the above investigation  1226 after these results on curved inductive action in air i extended the experiments to other gases using first carbonic acid and then hydrogen the phenomena were precisely those already described in these experiments i found that if the gases were confined in vessels they required to be very large for whether of glass or earthenware the conducting power of such materials is so great that the induction of the excited shelllac cylinder towards them is as much as if they were metal and if the vessels be small so great a portion of the inductive force is determined towards them that the lateral tension or mutual repulsion of the lines of force before spoken of 1224 by which their inflexion is caused is so much relieved in other directions that no inductive charge will be given to the carrier ball in the positions k l m n o p fig 110 a very good mode of making the experiment is to let large currents of the gases ascend or descend through the air and carry on the experiments in these currents  1227 these experiments were then varied by the substitution of a liquid dielectric namely oil of turpentine in place of air and gases a dish of thin glass wellcovered with a film of shelllac 1272 which was found by trial to insulate well had some highly rectified oil of turpentine put into it to the depth of half an inch and being then placed upon the top of the brass hemisphere fig 110 observations were made with the carrier ball as before 1224 the results were the same and the circumstance of some of the positions being within the fluid and some without made no sensible difference  1228 lastly i used a few solid dielectrics for the same purpose and with the same results these were shelllac sulphur fused and cast borate of lead flint glass wellcovered with a film of lac and spermaceti the following was the form of experiment with sulphur and all were of the same kind a square plate of the substance two inches in extent and 06 of an inch in thickness was cast with a small hole or depression in the middle of one surface to receive the carrier ball this was placed upon the surface of the metal hemisphere fig 112 arranged on the excited lac as in former cases and observations were made at n o p and q great care was required in these experiments to free the sulphur or other solid substance from any charge it might previously have received this was done by breathing and wiping 1203 and the substance being found free from all electrical excitement was then used in the experiment after which it was removed and again examined to ascertain that it had received no charge but had acted really as a dielectric with all these precautions the results were the same and it is thus very satisfactory to obtain the curved inductive action through solid bodies as any possible effect from the translation of charged particles in fluids or gases which some persons might imagine to be the case is here entirely negatived  1229 in these experiments with solid dielectrics the degree of charge assumed by the carrier ball at the situations n o p fig 112 was decidedly greater than that given to the ball at the same places when air only intervened between it and the metal hemisphere this effect is consistent with what will hereafter be found to be the respective relations of these bodies as to their power of facilitating induction through them 1269 1273 1277  1230 i might quote many other forms of experiment some old and some new in which induction in curved or contorted lines takes place but think it unnecessary after the preceding results i shall therefore mention but two if a conductor a fig 111 be electrified and an uninsulated metallic ball b or even a plate provided the edges be not too thin be held before it a small electrometer at c or at d uninsulated will give signs of electricity opposite in its nature to that of a and therefore caused by induction although the influencing and influenced bodies cannot be joined by a right line passing through the air or if the electrometers being removed a point be fixed at the back of the ball in its uninsulated state as at c this point will become luminous and discharge the conductor a the latter experiment is described by nicholsona who however reasons erroneously upon it as to its introduction here though it is a case of discharge the discharge is preceded by induction and that induction must be in curved lines    a encyclopædia britannica vol vi p 504  1231 as argument against the received theory of induction and in favour of that which i have ventured to put forth i cannot see how the preceding results can be avoided the effects are clearly inductive effects produced by electricity not in currents but in its statical state and this induction is exerted in lines of force which though in many experiments they may be straight are here curved more or less according to circumstances i use the term line of inductive force merely as a temporary conventional mode of expressing the direction of the power in cases of induction and in the experiments with the hemisphere 1224 it is curious to see how when certain lines have terminated on the under surface and edge of the metal those which were before lateral to them expand and open out from each other some bending round and terminating their action on the upper surface of the hemisphere and others meeting as it were above in their progress outwards uniting their forces to give an increased charge to the carrier ball at an increased distance from the source of power and influencing each other so as to cause a second flexure in the contrary direction from the first one all this appears to me to prove that the whole action is one of contiguous particles related to each other not merely in the lines which they may be conceived to form through the dielectric between the inductric and the inducteous surfaces 1483 but in other lateral directions also it is this which gives an effect equivalent to a lateral repulsion or expansion in the lines of force i have spoken of and enables induction to turn a corner 1304 the power instead of being like that of gravity which causes particles to act on each other through straight lines whatever other particles may be between them is more analogous to that of a series of magnetic needles or to the condition of the particles considered as forming the whole of a straight or a curved magnet so that in whatever way i view it and with great suspicion of the influence of favourite notions over myself i cannot perceive how the ordinary theory applied to explain induction can be a correct representation of that great natural principle of electrical action  1232 i have had occasion in describing the precautions necessary in the use of the inductive apparatus to refer to one founded on induction in curved lines 1203 and after the experiments already described it will easily be seen how great an influence the shelllac stem may exert upon the charge of the carrier ball when applied to the apparatus 1218 unless that precaution be attended to  1233 i think it expedient next in the course of these experimental researches to describe some effects due to conduction obtained with such bodies as glass lac sulphur c which had not been anticipated being understood they will make us acquainted with certain precautions necessary in investigating the great question of specific inductive capacity  1234 one of the inductive apparatus already described 1187 c had a hemispherical cup of shelllac introduced which being in the interval between the inner bull and the lower hemisphere nearly occupied the space there consequently when the apparatus was charged the lac was the dielectric or insulating medium through which the induction took place in that part when this apparatus was first charged with electricity 1198 up to a certain intensity as 400° measured by the coulombs electrometer 1180 it sank much faster from that degree than if it had been previously charged to a higher point and had gradually fallen to 400° or than it would do if the charge were by a second application raised up again to 400° all other things remaining the same again if after having been charged for some time as fifteen or twenty minutes it was suddenly and perfectly discharged even the stem having all electricity removed from it 1203 then the apparatus being left to itself would gradually recover a charge which in nine or ten minutes would rise up to 50° or 60° and in one instance to 80°  1235 the electricity which in these cases returned from an apparently latent to a sensible state was always of the same kind as that which had been given by the charge the return took place at both the inducing surfaces for if after the perfect discharge of the apparatus the whole was insulated as the inner ball resumed a positive state the outer sphere acquired a negative condition  1236 this effect was at once distinguished from that produced by the excited stem acting in curved lines of induction 1203 1232 by the circumstance that all the returned electricity could be perfectly and instantly discharged it appeared to depend upon the shelllac within and to be in some way due to electricity evolved from it in consequence of a previous condition into which it had been brought by the charge of the metallic coatings or balls  1237 to examine this state more accurately the apparatus with the hemispherical cup of shelllac in it was charged for about fortyfive minutes to above 600° with positive electricity at the balls h and b fig 104 above and within it was then discharged opened the shelllac taken out and its state examined this was done by bringing the carrier ball near the shelllac uninsulating it insulating it and then observing what charge it had acquired as it would be a charge by induction the state of the ball would indicate the opposite state of electricity in that surface of the shelllac which had produced it at first the lac appeared quite free from any charge but gradually its two surfaces assumed opposite states of electricity the concave surface which had been next the inner and positive ball assuming a positive state and the convex surface which had been in contact with the negative coating acquiring a negative state these states gradually increased in intensity for some time  1238 as the return action was evidently greatest instantly after the discharge i again put the apparatus together and charged it for fifteen minutes as before the inner ball positively i then discharged it instantly removing the upper hemisphere with the interior ball and leaving the shelllac cup in the lower uninsulated hemisphere examined its inner surface by the carrier ball as before 1237 in this way i found the surface of the shelllac actually negative or in the reverse state to the ball which had been in it this state quickly disappeared and was succeeded by a positive condition gradually increasing in intensity for some time in the same manner as before the first negative condition of the surface opposite the positive charging ball is a natural consequence of the state of things the charging ball being in contact with the shelllac only in a few points it does not interfere with the general result and peculiar state now under consideration except that it assists in illustrating in a very marked manner the ultimate assumption by the surfaces of the shelllac of an electrified condition similar to that of the metallic surfaces opposed to or against them  1239 glass was then examined with respect to its power of assuming this peculiar state i had a thick flintglass hemispherical cup formed which would fit easily into the space o of the lower hemisphere 1188 1189 it had been heated and varnished with a solution of shelllac in alcohol for the purpose of destroying the conducting power of the vitreous surface 1254 being then wellwarmed and experimented with i found it could also assume the same state but not apparently to the same degree the return action amounting in different cases to quantities from 6° to 18°  1240 spermaceti experimented with in the same manner gave striking results when the original charge had been sustained for fifteen or twenty minutes at about 500° the return charge was equal to 95° or 100° and was about fourteen minutes arriving at the maximum effect a charge continued for not more than two or three seconds was here succeeded by a return charge of 50° or 60° the observations formerly made 1234 held good with this substance spermaceti though it will insulate a low charge for some time is a better conductor than shelllac glass and sulphur and this conducting power is connected with the readiness with which it exhibits the particular effect under consideration  1241 sulphuri was anxious to obtain the amount of effect with this substance first because it is an excellent insulator and in that respect would illustrate the relation of the effect to the degree of conducting power possessed by the dielectric 1247 and in the next place that i might obtain that body giving the smallest degree of the effect now under consideration for the investigation of the question of specific inductive capacity 1277  1242 with a good hemispherical cup of sulphur cast solid and sound i obtained the return charge but only to an amount of 17° or 18° thus glass and sulphur which are bodily very bad conductors of electricity and indeed almost perfect insulators gave very little of this return charge  1243 i tried the same experiment having air only in the inductive apparatus after a continued high charge for some time i could obtain a little effect of return action but it was ultimately traced to the shelllac of the stem  1244 i sought to produce something like this state with one electric power and without induction for upon the theory of an electric fluid or fluids that did not seem impossible and then i should have obtained an absolute charge 1169 1177 or something equivalent to it in this i could not succeed i excited the outside of a cylinder of shelllac very highly for some time and then quickly discharging it 1203 waited and watched whether any return charge would appear but such was not the case this is another fact in favour of the inseparability of the two electric forces 1177 and another argument for the view that induction and its concomitant phenomena depend upon a polarity of the particles of matter  1245 although inclined at first to refer these effects to a peculiar masked condition of a certain portion of the forces i think i have since correctly traced them to known principles of electrical action the effects appear to be due to an actual penetration of the charge to some distance within the electric at each of its two surfaces by what we call conduction so that to use the ordinary phrase the electric forces sustaining the induction are not upon the metallic surfaces only but upon and within the dielectric also extending to a greater or smaller depth from the metal linings let c fig 113 be the section of a plate of any dielectric a and b being the metallic coatings let b be uninsulated and a be charged positively after ten or fifteen minutes if a and b be discharged insulated and immediately examined no electricity will appear in them but in a short time upon a second examination they will appear charged in the same way though not to the same degree as they were at first now suppose that a portion of the positive force has under the coercing influence of all the forces concerned penetrated the dielectric and taken up its place at the line p a corresponding portion of the negative force having also assumed its position at the line n that in fact the electric at these two parts has become charged positive and negative then it is clear that the induction of these two forces will be much greater one towards the other and less in an external direction now that they are at the small distance np from each other than when they were at the larger interval ab then let a and b be discharged the discharge destroys or neutralizes all external induction and the coatings are therefore found by the carrier ball unelectrified but it also removes almost the whole of the forces by which the electric charge was driven into the dielectric and though probably a part of that charge goes forward in its passage and terminates in what we call discharge the greater portion returns on its course to the surfaces of c and consequently to the conductors a and b and constitutes the recharge observed  1246 the following is the experiment on which i rest for the truth of this view two plates of spermaceti d and f fig 114 were put together to form the dielectric a and b being the metallic coatings of this compound plate as before the system was charged then discharged insulated examined and found to give no indications of electricity to the carrier ball the plates d and fwere then separated from each other and instantly a with d was found in a positive state and b with f in a negative state nearly all the electricity being in the linings a and b hence it is clear that of the forces sought for the positive was in onehalf of the compound plate and the negative in the other half for when removed bodily with the plates from each others inductive influence they appeared in separate places and resumed of necessity their power of acting by induction on the electricity of surrounding bodies had the effect depended upon a peculiar relation of the contiguous particles of matter only then each halfplate d and f should have shown positive force on one surface and negative on the other  1247 thus it would appear that the best solid insulators such as shelllac glass and sulphur have conductive properties to such an extent that electricity can penetrate them bodily though always subject to the overruling condition of induction 1178 as to the depth to which the forces penetrate in this form of charge of the particles theoretically it should be throughout the mass for what the charge of the metal does for the portion of dielectric next to it should be close by the charged dielectric for the portion next beyond it again but probably in the best insulators the sensible charge is to a very small depth only in the dielectric for otherwise more would disappear in the first instance whilst the original charge is sustained less time would be required for the assumption of the particular state and more electricity would reappear as return charge  1248 the condition of time required for this penetration of the charge is important both as respects the general relation of the cases to conduction and also the removal of an objection that might otherwise properly be raised to certain results respecting specific inductive capacities hereafter to be given 1269 1277  1249 it is the assumption for a time of this charged state of the glass between the coatings in the leyden jar which gives origin to a wellknown phenomenon usually referred to the diffusion of electricity over the uncoated portion of the glass namely the residual charge the extent of charge which can spontaneously be recovered by a large battery after perfect uninsulation of both surfaces is very considerable and by far the largest portion of this is due to the return of electricity in the manner described a plate of shelllac six inches square and half an inch thick or a similar plate of spermaceti an inch thick being coated on the sides with tinfoil as a leyden arrangement will show this effect exceedingly well                                       1250 the peculiar condition of dielectrics which has now been described is evidently capable of producing an effect interfering with the results and conclusions drawn from the use of the two inductive apparatus when shelllac glass c is used in one or both of them 1192 1207 for upon dividing the charge in such cases according to the method described 1198 1207 it is evident that the apparatus just receiving its half charge must fall faster in its tension than the other for suppose app i first charged and app ii used to divide with it though both may actually lose alike yet app i which has been diminished onehalf will be sustained by a certain degree of return action or charge 1234 whilst app ii will sink the more rapidly from the coming on of the particular state i have endeavoured to avoid this interference by performing the whole process of comparison as quickly as possible and taking the force of app ii immediately after the division before any sensible diminution of the tension arising from the assumption of the peculiar state could be produced and i have assumed that as about three minutes pass between the first charge of app i and the division and three minutes between the division and discharge when the force of the nontransferable electricity is measured the contrary tendencies for those periods would keep that apparatus in a moderately steady and uniform condition for the latter portion of time  1251 the particular action described occurs in the shelllac of the stems as well as in the dielectric used within the apparatus it therefore constitutes a cause by which the outside of the stems may in some operations become charged with electricity independent of the action of dust or carrying particles 1203   ¶ v on specific induction or specific inductive capacity  1252 i now proceed to examine the great question of specific inductive capacity ie whether different dielectric bodies actually do possess any influence over the degree of induction which takes place through them if any such difference should exist it appeared to me not only of high importance in the further comprehension of the laws and results of induction but an additional and very powerful argument for the theory i have ventured to put forth that the whole depends upon a molecular action in contradistinction to one at sensible distances  the question may be stated thus suppose a an electrified plate of metal suspended in the air and b and c two exactly similar plates placed parallel to and on each side of a at equal distances and uninsulated a will then induce equally towards b and c if in this position of the plates some other dielectric than air as shelllac be introduced between a and c will the induction between them remain the same will the relation of c and b to a be unaltered notwithstanding the difference of the dielectrics interposed between thema    a refer for the practical illustration of this statement to the   supplementary note commencing 1307 cdec 1838  1253 as far as i recollect it is assumed that no change will occur under such variation of circumstances and that the relations of b find c to a depend entirely upon their distance i only remember one experimental illustration of the question and that is by coulomba in which he shows that a wire surrounded by shelllac took exactly the same quantity of electricity from a charged body as the same wire in air the experiment offered to me no proof of the truth of the supposition for it is not the mere films of dielectric substances surrounding the charged body which have to be examined and compared but the whole mass between that body and the surrounding conductors at which the induction terminates charge depends upon induction 1171 1178 and if induction is related to the particles of the surrounding dielectric then it is related to all the particles of that dielectric inclosed by the surrounding conductors and not merely to the few situated next to the charged body whether the difference i sought for existed or not i soon found reason to doubt the conclusion that might be drawn from coulombs result and therefore had the apparatus made which with its use has been already described 1187 c and which appears to me wellsuited for the investigation of the question    a mémoires de lacadémie 1787 pp 452 453  1254 glass and many bodies which might at first be considered as very fit to test the principle proved exceedingly unfit for that purpose glass principally in consequence of the alkali it contains however wellwarmed and dried it may be has a certain degree of conducting power upon its surface dependent upon the moisture of the atmosphere which renders it unfit for a test experiment resin wax naphtha oil of turpentine and many other substances were in turn rejected because of a slight degree of conducting power possessed by them and ultimately shelllac and sulphur were chosen after many experiments as the dielectrics best fitted for the investigation no difficulty can arise in perceiving how the possession of a feeble degree of conducting power tends to make a body produce effects which would seem to indicate that it had a greater capability of allowing induction through it than another body perfect in its insulation this source of error has been that which i have found most difficult to obviate in the proving experiments                                       1255 induction through shelllacas a preparatory experiment i first ascertained generally that when a part of the surface of a thick plate of shelllac was excited or charged there was no sensible difference in the character of the induction sustained by that charged part whether exerted through the air in the one direction or through the shelllac of the plate in the other provided the second surface of the plate had not by contact with conductors the action of dust or any other means become charged 1203 its solid condition enabled it to retain the excited particles in a permanent position but that appeared to be all for these particles acted just as freely through the shelllac on one side as through the air on the other the same general experiment was made by attaching a disc of tinfoil to one side of the shelllac plate and electrifying it and the results were the same scarcely any other solid substance than shelllac and sulphur and no liquid substance that i have tried will bear this examination glass in its ordinary state utterly fails yet it was essentially necessary to obtain this prior degree of perfection in the dielectric used before any further progress could be made in the principal investigation  1256 shelllac and air were compared in the first place for this purpose a thick hemispherical cup of shelllac was introduced into the lower hemisphere of one of the inductive apparatus 1187 c so as nearly to fill the lower half of the space o o fig 104 between it and the inner ball and then charges were divided in the manner already described 1198 1207 each apparatus being used in turn to receive the first charge before its division by the other as the apparatus were known to have equal inductive power when air was in both 1209 1211 any differences resulting from the introduction of the shelllac would show a peculiar action in it and if unequivocally referable to a specific inductive influence would establish the point sought to be sustained i have already referred to the precautions necessary in making the experiments 1199 c and with respect to the error which might be introduced by the assumption of the peculiar state it was guarded against as far as possible in the first place by operating quickly 1248 and afterwards by using that dielectric as glass or sulphur which assumed the peculiar state most slowly and in the least degree 1239 1241  1257 the shelllac hemisphere was put into app i and app ii left filled with air the results of an experiment in which the charge through air was divided and reduced by the shelllac app were as follows  app i lac   app ii air         balls 255°      0°                   304°              297       charge divided    113                   121      0           after being discharged                7 after being discharged  1258 here 297° minus 7° or 290° may be taken as the divisible charge of app ii the 7° being fixed stem action 1203 1232 of which 145° is the half the lac app i gave 113° as the power or tension it had acquired after division and the air app ii gave 121° minus 7° or 114° as the force it possessed from what it retained of the divisible charge of 290° these two numbers should evidently be alike and they are very nearly so indeed far within the errors of experiment and observation but these numbers differ very much from 145° or the force which the half charge would have had if app i had contained air instead of shelllac and it appears that whilst in the division the induction through the air has lost 176° of force that through the lac has only gained 113°  1259 if this difference be assumed as depending entirely on the greater facility possessed by shelllac of allowing or causing inductive action through its substance than that possessed by air then this capacity for electric induction would be inversely as the respective loss and gain indicated above and assuming the capacity of the air apparatus as 1 that of the shelllac apparatus would be 176113 or 155  1260 this extraordinary difference was so unexpected in its amount as to excite the greatest suspicion of the general accuracy of the experiment though the perfect discharge of app i after the division showed that the 113° had been taken and given up readily it was evident that if it really existed it ought to produce corresponding effects in the reverse order and that when induction through shelllac was converted into induction through air the force or tension of the whole ought to be increased the app i was therefore charged in the first place and its force divided with app ii the following were the results  app i lac   app ii air                0°   215°        204             charge divided              118   118                      0 after being discharged     0            after being discharged  1261 here 204° must be the utmost of the divisible charge the app i and app ii present 118° as their respective forces both now much above the half of the first force or 102° whereas in the former case they were below it the lac app i has lost only 86° yet it has given to the air app ii 118° so that the lac still appears much to surpass the air the capacity of the lac app i to the air app ii being as 137 to 1  1262 the difference of 155 and 137 as the expression of the capacity for the induction of shelllac seems considerable but is in reality very admissible under the circumstances for both are in error in contrary directions thus in the last experiment the charge fell from 215° to 204° by the joint effects of dissipation and absorption 1192 1250 during the time which elapsed in the electrometer operations between the applications of the carrier ball required to give those two results nearly an equal time must have elapsed between the application of the carrier which gave the 204° result and the division of the charge between the two apparatus and as the fall in force progressively decreases in amount 1192 if in this case it be taken at 6° only it will reduce the whole transferable charge at the time of division to 198° instead of 204° this diminishes the loss of the shelllac charge to 80° instead of 86° and then the expression of specific capacity for it is increased and instead of 137 is 147 times that of air  1263 applying the same correction to the former experiment in which air was first charged the result is of the contrary kind no shelllac hemisphere was then in the apparatus and therefore the loss would be principally from dissipation and not from absorption hence it would be nearer to the degree of loss shown by the numbers 304° and 297° and being assumed as 6° would reduce the divisible charge to 284° in that case the air would have lost 170° and communicated only 113° to the shelllac and the relative specific capacity of the latter would appear to be 150 which is very little indeed removed from 147 the expression given by the second experiment when corrected in the same way  1264 the shelllac was then removed from app i and put into app ii and the experiments of division again made i give the results because i think the importance of the point justifies and even requires them  app i air   app ii lac         balls 200°                 0°   286°        283             charge divided              110   109                      025 after discharge trace               after discharge  here app i retained 109° having lost 174° in communicating 110° to app ii and the capacity of the air app is to the lac app therefore as 1 to 158 if the divided charge be corrected for an assumed loss of only 3° being the amount of previous loss in the same time it will make the capacity of the shelllac app 155 only  1265 then app ii was charged and the charge divided thus  app i air   app ii lac     0°                     250°               251       charge divided   146                      149 a little              after discharge              a little after discharge  here app i acquired a charge of 146° while app ii lost only 102° in communicating that amount of force the capacities being therefore to each other as 1 to 143 if the whole transferable charge be corrected for a loss of 4° previous to division it gives the expression of l49 for the capacity of the shelllac apparatus  1266 these four expressions of 147 150 155 and 149 for the power of the shelllac apparatus through the different variations of the experiment are very near to each other the average is close upon 15 which may hereafter be used as the expression of the result it is a very important result and showing for this particular piece of shelllac a decided superiority over air in allowing or causing the act of induction it proved the growing necessity of a more close and rigid examination of the whole question  1267 the shelllac was of the best quality and had been carefully selected and cleaned but as the action of any conducting particles in it would tend virtually to diminish the quantity or thickness of the dielectric used and produce effects as if the two inducing surfaces of the conductors in that apparatus were nearer together than in the one with air only i prepared another shelllac hemisphere of which the material had been dissolved in strong spirit of wine the solution filtered and then carefully evaporated this is not an easy operation for it is difficult to drive off the last portions of alcohol without injuring the lac by the heat applied and unless they be dissipated the substance left conducts too well to be used in these experiments i prepared two hemispheres this way one of them unexceptionable and with it i repeated the former experiments with all precautions the results were exactly of the same kind the following expressions for the capacity of the shelllac apparatus whether it were app i or ii being given directly by the experiments 146 150 152 151 the average of these and several others being very nearly 15  1268 as a final check upon the general conclusion i then actually brought the surfaces of the air apparatus corresponding to the place of the shelllac in its apparatus nearer together by putting a metallic lining into the lower hemisphere of the one not containing the lac 1213 the distance of the metal surface from the carrier ball was in this way diminished from 062 of an inch to 0435 of an inch whilst the interval occupied by the lac in the other apparatus remained o62 of an inch as before notwithstanding this change the lac apparatus showed its former superiority and whether it or the air apparatus was charged first the capacity of the lac apparatus to the air apparatus was by the experimental results as 145 to 1  1269 from all the experiments i have made and their constant results i cannot resist the conclusion that shelllac does exhibit a case of specific inductive capacity i have tried to check the trials in every way and if not remove at least estimate every source of error that the final result is not due to common conduction is shown by the capability of the apparatus to retain the communicated charge that it is not due to the conductive power of inclosed small particles by which they could acquire a polarized condition as conductors is shown by the effects of the shelllac purified by alcohol and that it is not due to any influence of the charged state formerly described 1250 first absorbing and then evolving electricity is indicated by the instantaneous assumption and discharge of those portions of the power which are concerned in the phenomena that instantaneous effect occurring in these cases as in all others of ordinary induction by charged conductors the latter argument is the more striking in the case where the air apparatus is employed to divide the charge with the lac apparatus for it obtains its portion of electricity in an instant and yet is charged far above the mean  1270 admitting for the present the general fact sought to be proved then 15 though it expresses the capacity of the apparatus containing the hemisphere of shelllac by no means expresses the relation of lac to air the lac only occupies onehalf of the space o o of the apparatus containing it through which the induction is sustained the rest is filled with air as in the other apparatus and if the effect of the two upper halves of the globes be abstracted then the comparison of the shelllac powers in the lower half of the one with the power of the air in the lower half of the other will be as 21 and even this must be less than the truth for the induction of the upper part of the apparatus ie of the wire and ball b fig 104 to external objects must be the same in both and considerably diminish the difference dependent upon and really producible by the influence of the shelllac within                                       1271 glassi next worked with glass as the dielectric it involved the possibility of conduction on its surface but it excluded the idea of conducting particles within its substance 1267 other than those of its own mass besides this it does not assume the charged state 1239 so readily or to such an extent as shelllac  1272 a thin hemispherical cup of glass being made hot was covered with a coat of shelllac dissolved in alcohol and after being dried for many hours in a hot place was put into the apparatus and experimented with it exhibited effects so slight that though they were in the direction indicating a superiority of glass over air they were allowed to pass as possible errors of experiment and the glass was considered as producing no sensible effect  1273 i then procured a thick hemispherical flint glass cup resembling that of shelllac 1239 but not filling up the space o o so well its average thickness was 04 of an inch there being an additional thickness of air averaging 022 of an inch to make up the whole space of 062 of an inch between the inductive metallic surfaces it was covered with a film of shelllac as the former was 1272 and being made very warm was introduced into the apparatus also warmed and experiments made with it as in the former instances 1257 c the general results were the same as with shelllac ie glass surpassed air in its power of favouring induction through it the two best results as respected the state of the apparatus for retention of charge c gave when the air apparatus was charged first 1336 and when the glass apparatus was charged first 145 as the specific inductive capacity for glass both being without correction the average of nine results four with the glass apparatus first charged and five with the air apparatus first charged gave 138 as the power of the glass apparatus 122 and 146 being the minimum and maximum numbers with all the errors of experiment upon them in all the experiments the glass apparatus took up its inductive charge instantly and lost it as readily 1269 and during the short time of each experiment acquired the peculiar state in a small degree only so that the influence of this state and also of conduction upon the results must have been small  1274 allowing specific inductive capacity to be proved and active in this case and 138 as the expression for the glass apparatus then the specific inductive capacity of flint glass will be above 176 not forgetting that this expression is for a piece of glass of such thickness as to occupy not quite twothirds of the space through which the induction is sustained 1253 1273                                       1275 sulphurthe same hemisphere of this substance was used in app ii as was formerly referred to 1242 the experiments were well made ie the sulphur itself was free from charge both before and after each experiment and no action from the stem appeared 1203 1232 so that no correction was required on that account the following are the results when the air apparatus was first charged and divided  app i air   app ii sulphur         balls 280°      0°                     0°

having lost 276° in communicating 162° to app ii and the capacity of the air apparatus is to that of the sulphur apparatus as 1 to 166  1276 then the sulphur apparatus was charged first thus                 0°     0°                   395              388       charge divided   237                    238     0            after discharge                0 after discharge  here app ii retained 238° and gave up 150° in communicating a charge of 237° to app i and the capacity of the air apparatus is to that of the sulphur apparatus as 1 to 158 these results are very near to each other and we may take the mean 162 as representing the specific inductive capacity of the sulphur apparatus in which case the specific inductive capacity of sulphur itself as compared to air  1 1270 will be about or above 224  1277 this result with sulphur i consider as one of the most unexceptionable the substance when fused was perfectly clear pellucid and free from particles of dirt 1267 so that no interference of small conducting bodies confused the result the substance when solid is an excellent insulator and by experiment was found to take up with great slowness that state 1244 1242 which alone seemed likely to disturb the conclusion the experiments themselves also were free from any need of correction yet notwithstanding these circumstances so favourable to the exclusion of error the result is a higher specific inductive capacity for sulphur than for any other body as yet tried and though this may in part be clue to the sulphur being in a better shape ie filling up more completely the space o o fig 104 than the cups of shelllac and glass still i feel satisfied that the experiments altogether fully prove the existence of a difference between dielectrics as to their power of favouring an inductive action through them which difference may for the present be expressed by the term specific inductive capacity  1278 having thus established the point in the most favourable cases that i could anticipate i proceeded to examine other bodies amongst solids liquids and gases these results i shall give with all convenient brevity                                       1279 spermacetia good hemisphere of spermaceti being tried as to conducting power whilst its two surfaces were still in contact with the tinfoil moulds used in forming it was found to conduct sensibly even whilst warm on removing it from the moulds and using it in one of the apparatus it gave results indicating a specific inductive capacity between 13 and 16 for the apparatus containing it but as the only mode of operation was to charge the air apparatus and then after a quick contact with the spermaceti apparatus ascertain what was left in the former 1281 no great confidence can be placed in the results they are not in opposition to the general conclusion but cannot be brought forward as argument in favour of it                                       1280 i endeavoured to find some liquids which would insulate well and could be obtained in sufficient quantity for these experiments oil of turpentine native naphtha rectified and the condensed oil gas fluid appeared by common experiments to promise best as to insulation being left in contact with fused carbonate of potassa chloride of lime and quick lime for some days and then filtered they were found much injured in insulating power but after distillation acquired their best state though even then they proved to be conductors when extensive metallic contact was made with them  1281 oil of turpentine rectifiedi filled the lower half of app i with the fluid and as it would not hold a charge sufficiently to enable me first to measure and then divide it i charged app ii containing air and dividing its charge with app i by a quick contact measured that remaining in app ii for theoretically if a quick contact would divide up to equal tension between the two apparatus yet without sensible loss from the conducting power of app i and app ii were left charged to a degree of tension above half the original charge it would indicate that oil of turpentine had less specific inductive capacity than air or if left charged below that mean state of tension it would imply that the fluid had the greater inductive capacity in an experiment of this kind app ii gave as its charge 390° before division with app i and 175° afterwards which is less than the half of 390° again being at 176° before division it was 79° after which is also less than half the divided charge being at 79° it was a third time divided and then fell to 36° less than the half of 79° such are the best results i could obtain they are not inconsistent with the belief that oil of turpentine has a greater specific capacity than air but they do not prove the fact since the disappearance of more than half the charge may be due to the conducting power merely of the fluid  1282 naphthathis liquid gave results similar in their nature and direction to those with oil of turpentine                                       1283 a most interesting class of substances in relation to specific inductive capacity now came under review namely the gases or aëriform bodies these are so peculiarly constituted and are bound together by so many striking physical and chemical relations that i expected some remarkable results from them air in various states was selected for the first experiments  1284 air rare and densesome experiments of division 1208 seemed to show that dense and rare air were alike in the property under examination a simple and better process was to attach one of the apparatus to an airpump to charge it and then examine the tension of the charge when the air within was more or less rarefied under these circumstances it was found that commencing with a certain charge that charge did not change in its tension or force as the air was rarefied until the rarefaction was such that discharge across the space o o fig 104 occurred this discharge was proportionate to the rarefaction but having taken place and lowered the tension to a certain degree that degree was not at all affected by restoring the pressure and density of the air to their first quantities                      inches of mercury thus at a pressure of 30   the charge was        88° again                 30   the charge was        88 again                 30   the charge was        87 reduced to            11   the charge was        87 raised again to       30   the charge was        86 being now reduced to   34 the charge fell to    81 raised again to       30   the charge was still  81  1285 the charges were low in these experiments first that they might not pass off at low pressure and next that little loss by dissipation might occur i now reduced them still lower that i might rarefy further and for this purpose in the following experiment used a measuring interval in the electrometer of only 15° 1185 the pressure of air within the apparatus being reduced to 19 inches of mercury the charge was found to be 29° then letting in air till the pressure was 30 inches the charge was still 29°  1286 these experiments were repeated with pure oxygen with the same consequences  1287 this result of no variation in the electric tension being produced by variation in the density or pressure of the air agrees perfectly with those obtained by mr harrisa and described in his beautiful and important investigations contained in the philosophical transactions namely that induction is the same in rare and dense air and that the divergence of an electrometer under such variations of the air continues the same provided no electricity pass away from it the effect is one entirely independent of that power which dense air has of causing a higher charge to be retained upon the surface of conductors in it than can be retained by the same conductors in rare air a point i propose considering hereafter    a philosophical transactions 1834 pp 223 224 237 244  1288 i then compared hot and cold air together by raising the temperature of one of the inductive apparatus as high as it could be without injury and then dividing charges between it and the other apparatus containing cold air the temperatures were about 50° and 200° still the power or capacity appeared to be unchanged and when i endeavoured to vary the experiment by charging a cold apparatus and then warming it by a spirit lamp i could obtain no proof that the inductive capacity underwent any alteration  1289 i compared damp and dry air together but could find no difference in the results                                       1290 gasesa very long series of experiments was then undertaken for the purpose of comparing different gases one with another they were all found to insulate well except such as acted on the shelllac of the supporting stem these were chlorine ammonia and muriatic acid they were all dried by appropriate means before being introduced into the apparatus it would have been sufficient to have compared each with air but in consequence of the striking result which came out namely that all had the same power of or capacity for sustaining induction through them which perhaps might have been expected after it was found that no variation of density or pressure produced any effect i was induced to compare them experimentally two and two in various ways that no difference might escape me and that the sameness of result might stand in full opposition to the contrast of property composition and condition which the gases themselves presented  1291 the experiments were made upon the following pairs of gases   1  nitrogen and       oxygen  2  oxygen             air  3  hydrogen           air  4  muriatic acid gas  air  5  oxygen             hydrogen  5  oxygen             carbonic acid  7  oxygen             olefiant gas  8  oxygen             nitrous gas  9  oxygen             sulphurous acid 10 oxygen              ammonia 11 hydrogen            carbonic acid 12  hydrogen            olefiant gas 13 hydrogen            sulphurous acid 14 hydrogen            fluosilicic acid 15 hydrogen            ammonia 16 hydrogen            arseniuretted hydrogen 17 hydrogen            sulphuretted hydrogen 18 nitrogen            olefiant gas 19 nitrogen            nitrous gas 20 nitrogen            nitrous oxide 21 nitrogen            ammonia 22 carbonic oxide      carbonic acid 23 carbonic oxide      olefiant gas 24 nitrous oxide       nitrous gas 25 ammonia             sulphurous acid  1292 notwithstanding the striking contrasts of all kinds which these gases present of property of density whether simple or compound anions or cations 665 of high or low pressure 1284 1286 hot or cold 1288 not the least difference in their capacity to favour or admit electrical induction through them could be perceived considering the point established that in all these gases induction takes place by an action of contiguous particles this is the more important and adds one to the many striking relations which hold between bodies having the gaseous condition and form another equally important electrical relation which will be examined in the next papera is that which the different gases have to each other at the same pressure of causing the retention of the same or different degrees of charge upon conductors in them these two results appear to bear importantly upon the subject of electrochemical excitation and decomposition for as all these phenomena different as they seem to be must depend upon the electrical forces of the particles of matter the very distance at which they seem to stand from each other will do much if properly considered to illustrate the principle by which they are held in one common bond and subject as they must be to one common law    a see in relation to this point 1382 cdec 1838  1293 it is just possible that the gases may differ from each other in their specific inductive capacity and yet by quantities so small as not to be distinguished in the apparatus i have used it must be remembered however that in the gaseous experiments the gases occupy all the space o o fig 104 between the inner and the outer ball except the small portion filled by the stem and the results therefore are twice as delicate as those with solid dielectrics  1294 the insulation was good in all the experiments recorded except nos 10 15 21 and 25 being those in which ammonia was compared with other gases when shelllac is put into ammoniacal gas its surface gradually acquires conducting power and in this way the lac part of the stem within was so altered that the ammonia apparatus could not retain a charge with sufficient steadiness to allow of division in these experiments therefore the other apparatus was charged its charge measured and divided with the ammonia apparatus by a quick contact and what remained untaken away by the division again measured 1281 it was so nearly onehalf of the original charge as to authorize with this reservation the insertion of ammoniacal gas amongst the other gases as having equal power with them   ¶ vi general results as to induction  1295 thus induction appears to be essentially an action of contiguous particles through the intermediation of which the electric force originating or appearing at a certain place is propagated to or sustained at a distance appearing there as a force of the same kind exactly equal in amount but opposite in its direction and tendencies 1164 induction requires no sensible thickness in the conductors which may be used to limit its extent an uninsulated leaf of gold may be made very highly positive on one surface and as highly negative on the other without the least interference of the two states whilst the inductions continue nor is it affected by the nature of the limiting conductors provided time be allowed in the case of those which conduct slowly for them to assume their final state 1170  1296 but with regard to the dielectrics or insulating media matters are very different 1167 their thickness has an immediate and important influence on the degree of induction as to their quality though all gases and vapours are alike whatever their state yet amongst solid bodies and between them and gases there are differences which prove the existence of specific inductive capacities these differences being in some cases very great  1297 the direct inductive force which may be conceived to be exerted in lines between the two limiting and charged conducting surfaces is accompanied by a lateral or transverse force equivalent to a dilatation or repulsion of these representative lines 1224 or the attractive force which exists amongst the particles of the dielectric in the direction of the induction is accompanied by a repulsive or a diverging force in the transverse direction 1304  1298 induction appears to consist in a certain polarized state of the particles into which they are thrown by the electrified body sustaining the action the particles assuming positive and negative points or parts which are symmetrically arranged with respect to each other and the inducting surfaces or particlesa the state must be a forced one for it is originated and sustained only by force and sinks to the normal or quiescent state when that force is removed it can be continued only in insulators by the same portion of electricity because they only can retain this state of the particles 1304    a the theory of induction which i am stating does not pretend to   decide whether electricity be a fluid or fluids or a mere power or   condition of recognized matter that is a question which i may be   induced to consider in the next or following series of these   researches  1299 the principle of induction is of the utmost generality in electric action it constitutes charge in every ordinary case and probably in every case it appears to be the cause of all excitement and to precede every current the degree to which the particles are affected in this their forced state before discharge of one kind or another supervenes appears to constitute what we call intensity  1300 when a leyden jar is charged the particles of the glass are forced into this polarized and constrained condition by the electricity of the charging apparatus discharge is the return of these particles to their natural state from their state of tension whenever the two electric forces are allowed to be disposed of in some other direction  1301 all charge of conductors is on their surface because being essentially inductive it is there only that the medium capable of sustaining the necessary inductive state begins if the conductors are hollow and contain air or any other dielectric still no charge can appear upon that internal surface because the dielectric there cannot assume the polarized state throughout in consequence of the opposing actions in different directions  1302 the known influence of form is perfectly consistent with the corpuscular view of induction set forth an electrified cylinder is more affected by the influence of the surrounding conductors which complete the condition of charge at the ends than at the middle because the ends are exposed to a greater sum of inductive forces than the middle and a point is brought to a higher condition than a ball because by relation to the conductors around more inductive force terminates on its surface than on an equal surface of the ball with which it is compared here too especially can be perceived the influence of the lateral or transverse force 1297 which being a power of the nature of or equivalent to repulsion causes such a disposition of the lines of inductive force in their course across the dielectric that they must accumulate upon the point the end of the cylinder or any projecting part  1303 the influence of distance is also in harmony with the same view there is perhaps no distance so great that induction cannot take place through ita but with the same constraining force 1298 it takes place the more easily according as the extent of dielectric through which it is exerted is lessened and as it is assumed by the theory that the particles of the dielectric though tending to remain in a normal state are thrown into a forced condition during the induction so it would seem to follow that the fewer there are of these intervening particles opposing their tendency to the assumption of the new state the greater degree of change will they suffer ie the higher will be the condition they assume and the larger the amount of inductive action exerted through them    a i have traced it experimentally from a ball placed in the middle   of the large cube formerly described 1173 to the sides of the cube   six feet distant and also from the same ball placed in the middle of   our large lectureroom to the walls of the room at twentysix feet   distance the charge sustained upon the ball in these cases being   solely due to induction through these distances  1304 i have used the phrases lines of inductive force and curved lines of force 1231 1297 1298 1302 in a general sense only just as we speak of the lines of magnetic force the lines are imaginary and the force in any part of them is of course the resultant of compound forces every molecule being related to every other molecule in all directions by the tension and reaction of those which are contiguous the transverse force is merely this relation considered in a direction oblique to the lines of inductive force and at present i mean no more than that by the phrase with respect to the term polarity also i mean at present only a disposition of force by which the same molecule acquires opposite powers on different parts the particular way in which this disposition is made will come into consideration hereafter and probably varies in different bodies and so produces variety of electrical relationa all i am anxious about at present is that a more particular meaning should not be attached to the expressions used than i contemplate further inquiry i trust will enable us by degrees to restrict the sense more and more and so render the explanation of electrical phenomena day by day more and more definite    a see now 1685 cdec 1838  1305 as a test of the probable accuracy of my views i have throughout this experimental examination compared them with the conclusions drawn by m poisson from his beautiful mathematical inquiriesa i am quite unfit to form a judgment of these admirable papers but as far as i can perceive the theory i have set forth and the results i have obtained are not in opposition to such of those conclusions as represent the final disposition and state of the forces in the limited number of cases be has considered his theory assumes a very different mode of action in induction to that which i have ventured to support and would probably find its mathematical test in the endeavour to apply it to cases of induction in curved lines to my feeling it is insufficient in accounting for the retention of electricity upon the surface of conductors by the pressure of the air an effect which i hope to show is simple and consistent according to the present viewb and it does not touch voltaic electricity or in any way associate it and what is called ordinary electricity under one common principle    a mémoires de linstitut 1811 tom xii the first page 1 and the second paging 163    b refer to 1377 1378 1379 1398dec 1838  i have also looked with some anxiety to the results which that indefatigable philosopher harris has obtained in his investigation of the laws of inductiona knowing that they were experimental and having a full conviction of their exactness but i am happy in perceiving no collision at present between them and the views i have taken    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 213  1306 finally i beg to say that i put forth my particular view with doubt and fear lest it should not bear the test of general examination for unless true it will only embarrass the progress of electrical science it has long been on my mind but i hesitated to publish it until the increasing persuasion of its accordance with all known facts and the manner in which it linked together effects apparently very different in kind urged me to write the present paper i as yet see no inconsistency between it and nature but on the contrary think i perceive much new light thrown by it on her operations and my next papers will be devoted to a review of the phenomena of conduction electrolyzation current magnetism retention discharge and some other points with an application of the theory to these effects and an examination of it by them   royal institution november 16 1837                                       supplementary note to experimental researches in electricity  eleventh series  received march 29 1838   1307 i have recently put into an experimental form that general statement of the question of specific inductive capacity which is given at no 1252 of series xi and the result is such as to lead me to hope the council of the royal society will authorize its addition to the paper in the form of a supplementary note three circular brass plates about five inches in diameter were mounted side by side upon insulating pillars the middle one a was a fixture but the outer plates b and c were moveable on slides so that all three could be brought with their sides almost into contact or separated to any required distance two gold leaves were suspended in a glass jar from insulated wires one of the outer plates b was connected with one of the gold leaves and the other outer plate with the other leaf the outer plates b and c were adjusted at the distance of an inch and a quarter from the middle plate a and the gold leaves were fixed at two inches apart a was then slightly charged with electricity and the plates b and c with their gold leaves thrown out of insulation at the same time and then left insulated in this state of things a was charged positive inductrically and b and c negative inducteously the same dielectric air being in the two intervals and the gold leaves hanging of course parallel to each other in a relatively unelectrified state  1308 a plate of shelllac threequarters of an inch in thickness and four inches square suspended by clean white silk thread was very carefully deprived of all charge 1203 so that it produced no effect on the gold leaves if a were uncharged and then introduced between plates a and b the electric relation of the three plates was immediately altered and the gold leaves attracted each other on removing the shelllac this attraction ceased on introducing it between a and c it was renewed on removing it the attraction again ceased and the shelllac when examined by a delicate coulomb electrometer was still without charge  1309 as a was positive b and c were of course negative but as the specific inductive capacity of shelllac is about twice that of air 1270 it was expected that when the lac was introduced between a and b a would induce more towards b than towards c that therefore b would become more negative than before towards a and consequently because of its insulated condition be positive externally as at its back or at the gold leaves whilst c would be less negative towards a and therefore negative outwards or at the gold leaves this was found to be the case for on whichever side of a the shelllac was introduced the external plate at that side was positive and the external plate on the other side negative towards each other and also to uninsulated external bodies  1310 on employing a plate of sulphur instead of shelllac the same results were obtained consistent with the conclusions drawn regarding the high specific inductive capacity of that body already given 1276  1311 these effects of specific inductive capacity can be exalted in various ways and it is this capability which makes the great value of the apparatus thus i introduced the shelllac between a and b and then for a moment connected b and c uninsulated them and finally left them in the insulated state the gold leaves were of course hanging parallel to each other on removing the shelllac the gold leaves attracted each other on introducing the shelllac between a and c this attraction was increased as had been anticipated from theory and the leaves came together though not more than four inches long and hanging three inches apart  1312 by simply bringing the gold leaves nearer to each other i was able to show the difference of specific inductive capacity when only thin plates of shelllac were used the rest of the dielectric space being filled with air by bringing b and c nearer to a another great increase of sensibility was made by enlarging the size of the plates still further power was gained by diminishing the extent of the wires c connected with the gold leaves another improvement resulted so that in fact the gold leaves became in this manner as delicate a test of specific inductive action as they are in bennets and singers electrometers of ordinary electrical charge  1313 it is evident that by making the three plates the sides of cells with proper precautions as regards insulation c this apparatus may be used in the examination of gases with far more effect than the former apparatus 1187 1290 and may perhaps bring out differences which have as yet escaped me 1292 1293  1314 it is also evident that two metal plates are quite sufficient to form the instrument the state of the single inducteous plate when the dielectric is changed being examined either by bringing a body excited in a known manner towards its gold leaves or what i think will be better employing a carrier ball in place of the leaf and examining that ball by the coulomb electrometer 1180 the inductive and inducteous surfaces may even be balls the latter being itself the carrier ball of the coulombs electrometer 1181 1229  1315 to increase the effect a small condenser may be used with great advantage thus if when two inducteous plates are used a little condenser were put in the place of the gold leaves i have no doubt the three principal plates might be reduced to an inch or even half an inch in diameter even the gold leaves act to each other for the time as the plates of a condenser if only two plates were used by the proper application of the condenser the same reduction might take place this expectation is fully justified by an effect already observed and described 1229  1316 in that case the application of the instrument to very extensive research is evident comparatively small masses of dielectrics could be examined as diamonds and crystals an expectation that the specific inductive capacity of crystals will vary in different directions according as the lines of inductive force 1304 are parallel to or in other positions in relation to the axes of the crystals can be testeda i purpose that these and many other thoughts which arise respecting specific inductive action and the polarity of the particles of dielectric matter shall be put to the proof as soon as i can find time    a refer for this investigation to 16801698dec 1838  1317 hoping that this apparatus will form an instrument of considerable use i beg to propose for it at the suggestion of a friend the

disruptive dischargeinsulationsparkbrushdifference of discharge at the positive and negative surfaces of conductors  received january 11read february 8 1838   1318 i proceed now according to my promise to examine by the great facts of electrical science that theory of induction which i have ventured to put forth 1165 1295 c the principle of induction is so universal that it pervades all electrical phenomena but the general case which i purpose at present to go into consists of insulation traced into and terminating with discharge with the accompanying effects this case includes the various modes of discharge and also the condition and characters of a current the elements of magnetic action being amongst the latter i shall necessarily have occasion to speak theoretically and even hypothetically and though these papers profess to be experimental researches i hope that considering the facts and investigations contained in the last series in support of the particular view advanced i shall not be considered as taking too much liberty on the present occasion or as departing too far from the character which they ought to have especially as i shall use every opportunity which presents itself of returning to that strong test of truth experiment  1319 induction has as yet been considered in these papers only in cases of insulation opposed to insulation is discharge the action or effect which may be expressed by the general term discharge may take place as far as we are aware at present in several modes thus that which is called simply conduction involves no chemical action and apparently no displacement of the particles concerned a second mode may be called electrolytic discharge in it chemical action does occur and particles must to a certain degree be displaced a third mode namely that by sparks or brushes may because of its violent displacement of the particles of the dielectric in its course be called the disruptive discharge and a fourth may perhaps be conveniently distinguished for a time by the words convection or carrying discharge being that in which discharge is effected either by the carrying power of solid particles or those of gases and liquids hereafter perhaps all these modes may appear as the result of one common principle but at present they require to be considered apart and i will now speak of the first mode for amongst all the forms of discharge that which we express by the term conduction appears the most simple and the most directly in contrast with insulation   ¶ vii conduction or conductive discharge  1320 though assumed to be essentially different yet neither cavendish nor poisson attempt to explain by or even state in their theories what the essential difference between insulation and conduction is nor have i anything perhaps to offer in this respect except that according to my view of induction insulation and conduction depend upon the same molecular action of the dielectrics concerned are only extreme degrees of one common condition or effect and in any sufficient mathematical theory of electricity must be taken as cases of the same kind hence the importance of the endeavour to show the connection between them under my theory of the electrical relations of contiguous particles  1321 though the action of the insulating dielectric in the charged leyden jar and that of the wire in discharging it may seem very different they may be associated by numerous intermediate links which carry us on from one to the other leaving i think no necessary connection unsupplied we may observe some of these in succession for information respecting the whole case  1322 spermnceti has been examined and found to be a dielectric through which induction can take place 1240 1246 its specific inductive capacity being about or above 18 1279 and the inductive action has been considered in it as in all other substances an action of contiguous particles  1323 but spermaceti is also a conductor though in so low a degree that we can trace the process of conduction as it were step by step through the mass 1247 and even when the electric force has travelled through it to a certain distance we can by removing the coercitive which is at the same time the inductive force cause it to return upon its path and reappear in its first place 1245 1246 here induction appears to be a necessary preliminary to conduction it of itself brings the contiguous particles of the dielectric into a certain condition which if retained by them constitutes insulation but if lowered by the communication of power from one particle to another constitutes conduction  1324 if glass or shelllac be the substances under consideration the same capabilities of suffering either induction or conduction through them appear 1233 1239 1247 but not in the same degree the conduction almost disappears 1239 1242 the induction therefore is sustained ie the polarized state into which the inductive force has brought the contiguous particles is retained there being little discharge action between them and therefore the insulation continues but what discharge there is appears to be consequent upon that condition of the particles into which the induction throws them and thus it is that ordinary insulation and conduction are closely associated together or rather are extreme cases of one common condition  1325 in ice or water we have a better conductor than spermaceti and the phenomena of induction and insulation therefore rapidly disappear because conduction quickly follows upon the assumption of the inductive state but let a plate of cold ice have metallic coatings on its sides and connect one of these with a good electrical machine in work and the other with the ground and it then becomes easy to observe the phenomena of induction through the ice by the electrical tension which can be obtained and continued on both the coatings 419 426 for although that portion of power which at one moment gave the inductive condition to the particles is at the next lowered by the consequent discharge due to the conductive act it is succeeded by another portion of force from the machine to restore the inductive state if the ice be converted into water the same succession of actions can be just as easily proved provided the water be distilled and if the machine be not powerful enough a voltaic battery be employed  1326 all these considerations impress my mind strongly with the conviction that insulation and ordinary conduction cannot be properly separated when we are examining into their nature that is into the general law or laws under which their phenomena are produced they appear to me to consist in an action of contiguous particles dependent on the forces developed in electrical excitement these forces bring the particles into a state of tension or polarity which constitutes both induction and insulation and being in this state the continuous particles have a power or capability of communicating their forces one to the other by which they are lowered and discharge occurs every body appears to discharge 444 987 but the possession of this capability in a greater or smaller degree in different bodies makes them better or worse conductors worse or better insulators and both induction and conduction appear to be the same in their principle and action 1320 except that in the latter an effect common to both is raised to the highest degree whereas in the former it occurs in the best cases in only an almost insensible quantity  1327 that in our attempts to penetrate into the nature of electrical action and to deduce laws more general than those we are at present acquainted with we should endeavour to bring apparently opposite effects to stand side by side in harmonious arrangement is an opinion of long standing and sanctioned by the ablest philosophers i hope therefore i may be excused the attempt to look at the highest cases of conduction as analogous to or even the same in kind with those of induction and insulation  1328 if we consider the slight penetration of sulphur 1241 1242 or shelllac 1234 by electricity or the feebler insulation sustained by spermaceti 1279 1240 as essential consequences and indications of their conducting power then may we look on the resistance of metallic wires to the passage of electricity through them as insulating power of the numerous wellknown cases fitted to show this resistance in what are called the perfect conductors the experiments of professor wheatstone best serve my present purpose since they were carried to such an extent as to show that time entered as an element into the conditions of conductiona even in metals when discharge was made through a copper wire 2640 feet in length and 115th of an inch in diameter so that the luminous sparks at each end of the wire and at the middle could be observed in the same place the latter was found to be sensibly behind the two former in time they being by the conditions of the experiment simultaneous hence a proof of retardation and what reason can be given why this retardation should not be of the same kind as that in spermaceti or in lac or sulphur but as in them retardation is insulation and insulation is induction why should we refuse the same relation to the same exhibitions of force in the metals    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 583  1329 we learn from the experiment that if time be allowed the retardation is gradually overcome and the same thing obtains for the spermaceti the lac and glass 1248 give but time in proportion to the retardation and the latter is at last vanquished but if that be the case and all the results are alike in kind the only difference being in the length of time why should we refuse to metals the previous inductive action which is admitted to occur in the other bodies the diminution of time is no negation of the action nor is the lower degree of tension requisite to cause the forces to traverse the metal as compared to that necessary in the cases of water spermaceti or lac these differences would only point to the conclusion that in metals the particles under induction can transfer their forces when at a lower degree of tension or polarity and with greater facility than in the instances of the other bodies  1330 let us look at mr wheatstones beautiful experiment in another point of view if leaving the arrangement at the middle and two ends of the long copper wire unaltered we remove the two intervening portions and replace them by wires of iron or platina we shall have a much greater retardation of the middle spark than before if removing the iron we were to substitute for it only five or six feet of water in a cylinder of the same diameter as the metal we should have still greater retardation if from water we passed to spermaceti either directly or by gradual steps through other bodies even though we might vastly enlarge the bulk for the purpose of evading the occurrence of a spark elsewhere 1331 than at the three proper intervals we should have still greater retardation until at last we might arrive by degrees so small as to be inseparable from each other at actual and permanent insulation what then is to separate the principle of these two extremes perfect conduction and perfect insulation from each other since the moment we leave in the smallest degree perfection at either extremity we involve the element of perfection at the opposite end especially too as we have not in nature the case of perfection either at one extremity or the other either of insulation or conduction  1331 again to return to this beautiful experiment in the various forms which may be given to it the forces are not all in the wire after they have left the leyden jar during the whole time 1328 occupied by the discharge they are disposed in part through the surrounding dielectric under the wellknown form of induction and if that dielectric be air induction takes place from the wire through the air to surrounding conductors until the ends of the wire are electrically related through its length and discharge has occurred ie for the time during which the middle spark is retarded beyond the others this is well shown by the old experiment in which a long wire is so bent that two parts plate viii fig 115 a b near its extremities shall approach within a short distance as a quarter of an inch of each other in the air if the discharge of a leyden jar charged to a sufficient degree be sent through such a wire by far the largest portion of the electricity will pass as a spark across the air at the interval and not by the metal does not the middle part of the wire therefore act here as an insulating medium though it be of metal and is not the spark through the air an indication of the tension simultaneous with induction of the electricity in the ends of this single wire why should not the wire and the air both be regarded as dielectrics and the action at its commencement and whilst there is tension as an inductive action if it acts through the contorted lines of the wire so it also does in curved and contorted lines through air 1219 1224 1231 and other insulating dielectrics 1228 and we can apparently go so far in the analogy whilst limiting the case to the inductive action only as to show that amongst insulating dielectrics some lead away the lines of force from others 1229 as the wire will do from worse conductors though in it the principal effect is no doubt due to the ready discharge between the particles whilst in a low state of tension the retardation is for the time insulation and it seems to me we may just as fairly compare the air at the interval a b fig 115 and the wire in the circuit as two bodies of the same kind and acting upon the same principles as far as the first inductive phenomena are concerned notwithstanding the different forms of discharge which ultimately followa as we may compare according to coulombs investigationsb different lengths of different insulating bodies required to produce the same amount of insulating effect    a these will be examined hereafter 1348 c    b mémoires de lacadémie 1785 p 612 or ency britann first   supp vol i p 614  1332 this comparison is still more striking when we take into consideration the experiment of mr harris in which he stretched a fine wire across a glass globe the air within being rarefieda on sending a charge through the joint arrangement of metal and rare air as much if not more electricity passed by the latter as by the former in the air rarefied as it was there can be no doubt the discharge was preceded by induction 1284 and to my mind all the circumstances indicate that the same was the case with the metal that in fact both substances are dielectrics exhibiting the same effects in consequence of the action of the same causes the only variation being one of degree in the different substances employed    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 212  1333 judging on these principles velocity of discharge through the same wire may be varied greatly by attending to the circumstances which cause variations of discharge through spermaceti or sulphur thus for instance it must vary with the tension or intensity of the first urging force 1234 1240 which tension is charge and induction so if the two ends of the wire in professor wheatstones experiment were immediately connected with two large insulated metallic surfaces exposed to the air so that the primary act of induction after making the contact for discharge might be in part removed from the internal portion of the wire at the first instant and disposed for the moment on its surface jointly with the air and surrounding conductors then i venture to anticipate that the middle spark would be more retarded than before and if these two plates were the inner and outer coating of a large jar or a leyden battery then the retardation of that spark would be still greater  1334 cavendish was perhaps the first to show distinctly that discharge was not always by one channela but if several are present by many at once we may make these different channels of different bodies and by proportioning their thicknesses and lengths may include such substances as air lac spermaceti water protoxide of iron iron and silver and by one discharge make each convey its proportion of the electric force perhaps the air ought to be excepted as its discharge by conduction is questionable at present 1336 but the others may all be limited in their mode of discharge to pure conduction yet several of them suffer previous induction precisely like the induction through the air it being a necessary preliminary to their discharging action how can we therefore separate any one of these bodies from the others as to the principles and mode of insulating and conducting except by mere degree all seem to me to be dielectrics acting alike and under the same common laws    a philosophical transactions 1776 p 197  1335 i might draw another argument in favour of the general sameness in nature and action of good and bad conductors and all the bodies i refer to are conductors more or less from the perfect equipoise in action of very different bodies when opposed to each other in magnetoelectric inductive action as formerly described 213 but am anxious to be as brief as is consistent with the clear examination of the probable truth of my views  1336 with regard to the possession by the gases of any conducting power of the simple kind now under consideration the question is a very difficult one to determine at present experiments seem to indicate that they do insulate certain low degrees of tension perfectly and that the effects which may have appeared to be occasioned by conduction have been the result of the carrying power of the charged particles either of the air or of dust in it it is equally certain however that with higher degrees of tension or charge the particles discharge to one another and that is conduction if the gases possess the power of insulating a certain low degree of tension continuously and perfectly such a result may be due to their peculiar physical state and the condition of separation under which their particles are placed but in that or in any case we must not forget the fine experiments of cagniard de la toura in which he has shown that liquids and their vapours can be made to pass gradually into each other to the entire removal of any marked distinction of the two states thus hot dry steam and cold water pass by insensible gradations into each other yet the one is amongst the gases as an insulator and the other a comparatively good conductor as to conducting power therefore the transition from metals even up to gases is gradual substances make but one series in this respect and the various cases must come under one condition and law 444 the specific differences of bodies as to conducting power only serves to strengthen the general argument that conduction like insulation is a result of induction and is an action of contiguous particles    a annales de chimie xxi pp 127 178 or quarterly journal of   science xv 145  1337 i might go on now to consider induction and its concomitant conduction through mixed dielectrics as for instance when a charged body instead of acting across air to a distant uninsulated conductor acts jointly through it and an interposed insulated conductor in such a case the air and the conducting body are the mixed dielectrics and the latter assumes a polarized condition as a mass like that which my theory assumes each particle of the air to possess at the same time 1679 but i fear to be tedious in the present condition of the subject and hasten to the consideration of other matter  1338 to sum up in some degree what has been said i look upon the first effect of an excited body upon neighbouring matters to be the production of a polarized state of their particles which constitutes induction and this arises from its action upon the particles in immediate contact with it which again act upon those contiguous to them and thus the forces are transferred to a distance if the induction remain undiminished then perfect insulation is the consequence and the higher the polarized condition which the particles can acquire or maintain the higher is the intensity which may be given to the acting forces if on the contrary the contiguous particles upon acquiring the polarized state have the power to communicate their forces then conduction occurs and the tension is lowered conduction being a distinct act of discharge between neighbouring particles the lower the state of tension at which this discharge between the particles of a body takes place the better conductor is that body in this view insulators may be said to be bodies whose particles can retain the polarized state whilst conductors are those whose particles cannot be permanently polarized if i be right in my view of induction then i consider the reduction of these two effects which have been so long held distinct to an action of contiguous particles obedient to one common law as a very important result and on the other hand the identity of character which the two acquire when viewed by the theory 1326 is additional presumptive proof in favour of the correctness of the latter                                       1339 that heat has great influence over simple conduction is well known 445 its effect being in some cases almost an entire change of the characters of the body 432 1340 harris has however shown that it in no respect affects gaseous bodies or at least aira and davy has taught us that as a class metals have their conducting power diminished by itb    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 230    b ibid 1821 p 431  1340 i formerly described a substance sulphuret of silver whose conducting power was increased by heat 433 437 438 and i have since then met with another as strongly affected in the same way this is fluoride of lead when a piece of that substance which had been fused and cooled was introduced into the circuit of a voltaic battery it stopped the current being heated it acquired conducting powers before it was visibly redhot in daylight and even sparks could be taken against it whilst still solid the current alone then raised its temperature as in the case of sulphuret of silver until it fused after which it seemed to conduct as well as the metallic vessel containing it for whether the wire used to complete the circuit touched the fused fluoride only or was in contact with the platina on which it was supported no sensible difference in the force of the current was observed during all the time there was scarcely a trace of decomposing action of the fluoride and what did occur seemed referable to the air and moisture of the atmosphere and not to electrolytic action  1341 i have now very little doubt that periodide of mercury 414 448 691 is a case of the same kind and also corrosive sublimate 692 i am also inclined to think since making the above experiments that the anomalous action of the protoxide of antimony formerly observed and described 693 801 may be referred in part to the same cause  1342 i have no intention at present of going into the particular relation of heat and electricity but we may hope hereafter to discover by experiment the law which probably holds together all the above effects with those of the evolution and the disappearance of heat by the current and the striking and beautiful results of thermoelectricity in one common bond   ¶ viii electrolytic discharge  1343 i have already expressed in a former paper 1164 the view by which i hope to associate ordinary induction and electrolyzation under that view the discharge of electric forces by electrolyzation is rather an effect superadded in a certain class of bodies to those already described as constituting induction and insulation than one independent of and distinct from these phenomena  1344 electrolytes as respects their insulating and conducting forces belong to the general category of bodies 1320 1334 and if they are in the solid state as nearly all can assume that state they retain their place presenting then no new phenomenon 426 c or if one occur being in so small a proportion as to be almost unimportant when liquefied they also belong to the same list whilst the electric intensity is below a certain degree but at a given intensity 910 912 1007 fixed for each and very low in all known cases they play a new part causing discharge in proportion 783 to the development of certain chemical effects of combination and decomposition and at this point move out from the general class of insulators and conductors to form a distinct one by themselves the former phenomena have been considered 1320 1338 it is the latter which have now to be revised and used as a test of the proposed theory of induction  1345 the theory assumes that the particles of the dielectric now an electrolyte are in the first instance brought by ordinary inductive action into a polarized state and raised to a certain degree of tension or intensity before discharge commences the inductive state being in fact a necessary preliminary to discharge by taking advantage of those circumstances which bear upon the point it is not difficult to increase the tension indicative of this state of induction and so make the state itself more evident thus if distilled water be employed and a long narrow portion of it placed between the electrodes of a powerful voltaic battery we have at once indications of the intensity which can be sustained at these electrodes by the inductive action through the water as a dielectric for sparks may be obtained gold leaves diverged and leyden bottles charged at their wires the water is in the condition of the spermaceti 1322 1323 a bad conductor and a bad insulator but what it does insulate is by virtue of inductive action and that induction is the preparation for and precursor of discharge 1338  1346 the induction and tension which appear at the limits of the portion of water in the direction of the current are only the sums of the induction and tension of the contiguous particles between those limits and the limitation of the inductive tension to a certain degree shows time entering in each case as an important element of the result that when the particles have acquired a certain relative state discharge or a transfer of forces equivalent to ordinary conduction takes place  1347 in the inductive condition assumed by water before discharge comes on the particles polarized are the particles of the water that being the dielectric useda but the discharge between particle and particle is not as before a mere interchange of their powers or forces at the polar parts but an actual separation of them into their two elementary particles the oxygen travelling in one direction and carrying with it its amount of the force it had acquired during the polarization and the hydrogen doing the same thing in the other direction until they each meet the next approaching particle which is in the same electrical state with that they have left and by association of their forces with it produce what constitutes discharge this part of the action may be regarded as a carrying one 1319 1572 1622 performed by the constituent particles of the dielectric the latter is always a compound body 664 823 and by those who have considered the subject and are acquainted with the philosophical view of transfer which was first put forth by grotthussb its particles may easily be compared to a series of metallic conductors under inductive action which whilst in that state are divisible into these elementary moveable halves    a see 16991708dec 1838    b annales de chimie lviii 60 and lxiii 20  1348 electrolytic discharge depends of necessity upon the nonconduction of the dielectric as a whole and there are two steps or acts in the process first a polarization of the molecules of the substance and then a lowering of the forces by the separation advance in opposite directions and recombination of the elements of the molecules these being as it were the halves of the originally polarized conductors or particles  1349 these views of the decomposition of electrolytes and the consequent effect of discharge which as to the particular case are the same with those of grotthuss 481 and davy 482 though they differ from those of biot 487 de la rive 490 and others seem to me to be fully in accordance not merely with the theory i have given of induction generally 1165 but with all the known facts of common induction conduction and electrolytic discharge and in that respect help to confirm in my mind the truth of the theory set forth the new mode of discharge which electrolyzation presents must surely be an evidence of the action of contiguous particles and as this appears to depend directly upon a previous inductive state which is the same with common induction it greatly strengthens the argument which refers induction in all cases to an action of contiguous particles also 1295 c  1350 as an illustration of the condition of the polarized particles in a dielectric under induction i may describe an experiment put into a glass vessel some clear rectified oil of turpentine and introduce two wires passing through glass tubes where they coincide with the surface of the fluid and terminating either in balls or points cut some very clean dry white silk into small particles and put these also into the liquid then electrify one of the wires by an ordinary machine and discharge by the other the silk will immediately gather from all parts of the liquid and form a band of particles reaching from wire to wire and if touched by a glass rod will show considerable tenacity yet the moment the supply of electricity ceases the band will fall away and disappear by the dispersion of its parts the conduction by the silk is in this case very small and after the best examination i could give to the effects the impression on my mind is that the adhesion of the whole is due to the polarity which each filament acquires exactly as the particles of iron between the poles of a horseshoe magnet are held together in one mass by a similar disposition of forces the particles of silk therefore represent to me the condition of the molecules of the dielectric itself which i assume to be polar just as that of the silk is in all cases of conductive discharge the contiguous polarized particles of the body are able to effect a neutralization of their forces with greater or less facility as the silk does also in a very slight degree further we are not able to carry the parallel except in imagination but if we could divide each particle of silk into two halves and let each half travel until it met and united with the next half in an opposite state it would then exert its carrying power 1347 and so far represent electrolytic discharge  1351 admitting that electrolytic discharge is a consequence of previous induction then how evidently do its numerous cases point to induction in curved lines 521 1216 and to the divergence or lateral action of the lines of inductive force 1231 and so strengthen that part of the general argument in the former paper if two balls of platina forming the electrodes of a voltaic battery are put into a large vessel of dilute sulphuric acid the whole of the surfaces are covered with the respective gases in beautifully regulated proportions and the mind has no difficulty in conceiving the direction of the curved lines of discharge and even the intensity of force of the different lines by the quantity of gas evolved upon the different parts of the surface from this condition of the lines of inductive force arise the general effects of diffusion the appearance of the anions or cathions round the edges and on the further side of the electrodes when in the form of plates and the manner in which the current or discharge will follow all the forms of the electrolyte however contorted hence also the effects which nobili has so well examined and describeda in his papers on the distribution of currents in conducting masses all these effects indicate the curved direction of the currents or discharges which occur in and through the dielectrics and these are in every case preceded by equivalent inductive actions of the contiguous particles    a bibliothèque universelle 1835 lix 263 416  1352 hence also the advantage when the exciting forces are weak or require assistance of enlarging the mass of the electrolyte of increasing the size of the electrodes of making the coppers surround the zincsall is in harmony with the view of induction which i am endeavouring to examine i do not perceive as yet one fact against it  1353 there are many points of electrolytic discharge which ultimately will require to be very closely considered though i can but slightly touch upon them it is not that as far as i have investigated them they present any contradiction to the view taken for i have carefully though unsuccessfully sought for such cases but simply want of time as yet to pursue the inquiry which prevents me from entering upon them here  1354 one point is that different electrolytes or dielectrics require different initial intensities for their decomposition 912 this may depend upon the degree of polarization which the particles require before electrolytic discharge commences it is in direct relation to the chemical affinity of the substances concerned and will probably be found to have a relation or analogy to the specific inductive capacity of different bodies 1252 1296 it thus promises to assist in causing the great truths of those extensive sciences which are occupied in considering the forces of the particles of matter to fall into much closer order and arrangement than they have heretofore presented  1355 another point is the facilitation of electrolytic conducting power or discharge by the addition of substances to the dielectric employed this effect is strikingly shown where water is the body whose qualities are improved but as yet no general law governing all the phenomena has been detected thus some acids as the sulphuric phosphoric oxalic and nitric increase the power of water enormously whilst others as the tartaric and citric acids give but little power and others again as the acetic and boracic acids do not produce a change sensible to the voltameter 739 ammonia produces no effect but its carbonate does the caustic alkalies and their carbonates produce a fair effect sulphate of soda nitre 753 and many soluble salts produce much effect percyanide of mercury and corrosive sublimate produce no effect nor does iodine gum or sugar the test being a voltameter in many cases the added substance is acted on either directly or indirectly and then the phenomena are more complicated such substances are muriatic acid 758 the soluble protochlorides 766 and iodides 769 nitric acid 752 c in other cases the substance added is not when alone subject to or a conductor of the powers of the voltaic battery and yet both gives and receives power when associated with water m de la rive has pointed this result out in sulphurous acida iodine and bromineb the chloride of arsenic produces the same effect a far more striking case however is presented by that very influential body sulphuric acid 681 and probably phosphoric acid also is in the same peculiar relation    a quarterly journal xxvii 407 or bibliothèque universelle xl   205 kemp says sulphurous acid is a very good conductor quarterly   journal 1831 p 613    b quarterly journal xxiv 465 or annales de chimie xxxv 161  1356 it would seem in the cases of those bodies which suffer no change themselves as sulphuric acid and perhaps in all that they affect water in its conducting power only as an electrolyte for whether little or much improved the decomposition is proportionate to the quantity of electricity passing 727 730 and the transfer is therefore due to electrolytic discharge this is in accordance with the fact already stated as regards water 984 that the conducting power is not improved for electricity of force below the electrolytic intensity of the substance acting as the dielectric but both facts and some others are against the opinion which i formerly gave that the power of salts c might depend upon their assumption of the liquid state by solution in the water employed 410 it occurs to me that the effect may perhaps be related to and have its explanation in differences of specific inductive capacities  1357 i have described in the last paper cases where shelllac was rendered a conductor by absorption of ammonia 1294 the same effect happens with muriatic acid yet both these substances when gaseous are nonconductors and the ammonia also when in strong solution 718 mr harris has mentioned instancesa in which the conducting power of metals is seriously altered by a very little alloy these may have no relation to the former cases but nevertheless should not be overlooked in the general investigation which the whole question requires    a philosophical transactions 1827 p 22  1358 nothing is perhaps more striking in that class of dielectrics which we call electrolytes than the extraordinary and almost complete suspension of their peculiar mode of effecting discharge when they are rendered solid 380 c even though the intensity of the induction acting through them may be increased a hundredfold or more 419 it not only establishes a very general relation between the physical properties of these bodies and electricity acting by induction through them but draws both their physical and chemical relations so near together as to make us hope we shall shortly arrive at the full comprehension of the influence they mutually possess over each other   ¶ ix disruptive discharge and insulation  1359 the next form of discharge has been distinguished by the adjective disruptive 1319 as it in every case displaces more or less the particles amongst and across which it suddenly breaks i include under it discharge in the form of sparks brushes and glow 1405 but exclude the cases of currents of air fluids c which though frequently accompanying the former are essentially distinct in their nature  1360 the conditions requisite for the production of an electric spark in its simplest form are wellknown an insulating dielectric must be interposed between two conducting surfaces in opposite states of electricity and then if the actions be continually increased in strength or otherwise favoured either by exalting the electric state of the two conductors or bringing them nearer to each other or diminishing the density of the dielectric a spark at last appears and the two forces are for the time annihilated for discharge has occurred  1361 the conductors which may be considered as the termini of the inductive action are in ordinary cases most generally metals whilst the dielectrics usually employed are common air and glass in my view of induction however every dielectric becomes of importance for as the results are considered essentially dependent on these bodies it was to be expected that differences of action never before suspected would be evident upon close examination and so at once give fresh confirmation of the theory and open new doors of discovery into the extensive and varied fields of our science this hope was especially entertained with respect to the gases because of their high degree of insulation their uniformity in physical condition and great difference in chemical properties  1362 all the effects prior to the discharge are inductive and the degree of tension which it is necessary to attain before the spark passes is therefore in the examination i am now making of the new view of induction a very important point it is the limit of the influence which the dielectric exerts in resisting discharge it is a measure consequently of the conservative power of the dielectric which in its turn may be considered as becoming a measure and therefore a representative of the intensity of the electric forces in activity  1363 many philosophers have examined the circumstances of this limiting action in air but as far as i know none have come near mr harris as to the accuracy with and the extent to which he has carried on his investigationsa some of his results i must very briefly notice premising that they are all obtained with the use of air as the dielectric between the conducting surfaces    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 225  1364 first as to the distance between the two balls used or in other words the thickness of the dielectric across which the induction was sustained the quantity of electricity measured by a unit jar or otherwise on the same principle with the unit jar in the charged or inductive ball necessary to produce spark discharge was found to vary exactly with the distance between the balls or between the discharging points and that under very varied and exact forms of experimenta    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 225  1365 then with respect to variation in the pressure or density of the air the quantities of electricity required to produce discharge across a constant interval varied exactly with variations of the density the quantity of electricity and density of the air being in the same simple ratio or if the quantity was retained the same whilst the interval and density of the air were varied then these were found in the inverse simple ratio of each other the same quantity passing across twice the distance with air rarefied to onehalfa    a philosophical transactions 1834 p229  1366 it must be remembered that these effects take place without any variation of the inductive force by condensation or rarefaction of the air that force remains the same in aira and in all gases 1284 1292 whatever their rarefaction may be    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 237 244  1367 variation of the temperature of the air produced no variation of the quantity of electricity required to cause discharge across a given intervala    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 230  such are the general results which i have occasion for at present obtained by mr harris and they appear to me to be unexceptionable  1368 in the theory of induction founded upon a molecular action of the dielectric we have to look to the state of that body principally for the cause and determination of the above effects whilst the induction continues it is assumed that the particles of the dielectric are in a certain polarized state the tension of this state rising higher in each particle as the induction is raised to a higher degree either by approximation of the inducing surfaces variation of form increase of the original force or other means until at last the tension of the particles having reached the utmost degree which they can sustain without subversion of the whole arrangement discharge immediately after takes place  1369 the theory does not assume however that all the particles of the dielectric subject to the inductive action are affected to the same amount or acquire the same tension what has been called the lateral action of the lines of inductive force 1231 1297 and the diverging and occasionally curved form of these lines is against such a notion the idea is that any section taken through the dielectric across the lines of inductive force and including all of them would be equal in the sum of the forces to the sum of the forces in any other section and that therefore the whole amount of tension for each such section would be the same  1370 discharge probably occurs not when all the particles have attained to a certain degree of tension but when that particle which is most affected has been exalted to the subverting or turning point 1410 for though all the particles in the line of induction resist charge and are associated in their actions so as to give a sum of resisting force yet when any one is brought up to the overturning point all must give way in the case of a spark between ball and ball the breaking down of that one must of necessity cause the whole barrier to be overturned for it was at its utmost degree of resistance when it possessed the aiding power of that one particle in addition to the power of the rest and the power of that one is now lost hence tension or intensitya may according to the theory be considered as represented by the particular condition of the particles or the amount in them of forced variation from their normal state 1298 1368    a see harris on proposed particular meaning of these terms   philosophical transactions 1834 p 222  1371 the whole effect produced by a charged conductor on a distant conductor insulated or not is by my theory assumed to be due to an action propagated from particle to particle of the intervening and insulating dielectric all the particles being considered as thrown for the time into a forced condition from which they endeavour to return to their normal or natural state the theory therefore seems to supply an easy explanation of the influence of distance in affecting induction 1303 1364 as the distance is diminished induction increases for there are then fewer particles in the line of inductive force to oppose their united resistance to the assumption of the forced or polarized state and vice versa again as the distance diminishes discharge across happens with a lower charge of electricity for if as in harriss experiments 1364 the interval be diminished to onehalf then half the electricity required to discharge across the first interval is sufficient to strike across the second and it is evident also that at that time there are only half the number of interposed molecules uniting their forces to resist the discharge  1372 the effect of enlarging the conducting surfaces which are opposed to each other in the act of induction is if the electricity be limited in its supply to lower the intensity of action and this follows as a very natural consequence from the increased area of the dielectric across which the induction is effected for by diffusing the inductive action which at first was exerted through one square inch of sectional area of the dielectric over two or three square inches of such area twice or three times the number of molecules of the dielectric are brought into the polarized condition and employed in sustaining the inductive action and consequently the tension belonging to the smaller number on which the limited force was originally accumulated must fall in a proportionate degree  1373 for the same reason diminishing these opposing surfaces must increase the intensity and the effect will increase until the surfaces become points but in this case the tension of the particles of the dielectric next the points is higher than that of particles midway because of the lateral action and consequent bulging as it were of the lines of inductive force at the middle distance 1369  1374 the more exalted effects of induction on a point p or any small surface as the rounded end of a rod when it is opposed to a large surface as that of a ball or plate rather than to another point or end the distance being in both cases the same fall into harmonious relation with my theory 1302 for in the latter case the small surface p is affected only by those particles which are brought into the inductive condition by the equally small surface of the opposed conductor whereas when that is a ball or plate the lines of inductive force from the latter are concentrated as it were upon the end p now though the molecules of the dielectric against the large surface may have a much lower state of tension than those against the corresponding smaller surface yet they are also far more numerous and as the lines of inductive force converge towards a point are able to communicate to the particles contained in any cross section 1369 nearer the small surface an amount of tension equal to their own and consequently much higher for each individual particle so that at the surface of the smaller conductor the tension of a particle rises much and if that conductor were to terminate in a point the tension would rise to an infinite degree except that it is limited as before 1368 by discharge the nature of the discharge from small surfaces and points under induction will be resumed hereafter 1425 c  1375 rarefaction of the air does not alter the intensity of inductive action 1284 1287 nor is there any reason as far as i can perceive why it should if the quantity of electricity and the distance remain the same and the air be rarefied onehalf then though onehalf of the particles of the dielectric are removed the other half assume a double degree of tension in their polarity and therefore the inductive forces are balanced and the result remains unaltered as long as the induction and insulation are sustained but the case of discharge is very different for as there are only half the number of dielectric particles in the rarefied atmosphere so these are brought up to the discharging intensity by half the former quantity of electricity discharge therefore ensues and such a consequence of the theory is in perfect accordance with mr harriss results 1365  1376 the increase of electricity required to cause discharge over the same distance when the pressure of the air or its density is increased flows in a similar manner and on the same principle 1375 from the molecular theory  1377 here i think my view of induction has a decided advantage over others especially over that which refers the retention of electricity on the surface of conductors in air to the pressure of the atmosphere 1305 the latter is the view which being adopted by poisson and biota is also i believe that generally received and it associates two such dissimilar things as the ponderous air and the subtile and even hypothetical fluid or fluids of electricity by gross mechanical relations by the bonds of mere static pressure my theory on the contrary sets out at once by connecting the electric forces with the particles of matter it derives all its proofs and even its origin in the first instance from experiment and then without any further assumption seems to offer at once a full explanation of these and many other singular peculiar and i think heretofore unconnected effects    a encyclopædia britannica supplement vol iv article electricity   pp 76 81 c  1378 an important assisting experimental argument may here be adduced derived from the difference of specific inductive capacity of different dielectrics 1269 1274 1278 consider an insulated sphere electrified positively and placed in the centre of another and larger sphere uninsulated a uniform dielectric as air intervening the case is really that of my apparatus 1187 and also in effect that of any ball electrified in a room and removed to some distance from irregularlyformed conductors whilst things remain in this state the electricity is distributed so to speak uniformly over the surface of the electrified sphere but introduce such a dielectric as sulphur or lac into the space between the two conductors on one side only or opposite one part of the inner sphere and immediately the electricity on the latter is diffused unequally 1229 1270 1309 although the form of the conducting surfaces their distances and the pressure of the atmosphere remain perfectly unchanged  1379 fusinieri took a different view from that of poisson biot and others of the reason why rarefaction of air caused easy diffusion of electricity he considered the effect as due to the removal of the obstacle which the air presented to the expansion of the substances from which the electricity passeda but platina balls show the phenomena in vacuo as well as volatile metals and other substances besides which when the rarefaction is very considerable the electricity passes with scarcely any resistance and the production of no sensible heat so that i think fusinieris view of the matter is likely to gain but few assents    a bib univ 1831 xlviii 375  1380 i have no need to remark upon the discharging or collecting power of flame or hot air i believe with harris that the mere heat does nothing 1367 the rarefaction only being influential the effect of rarefaction has been already considered generally 1375 and that caused by the heat of a burning light with the pointed form of the wick and the carrying power of the carbonaceous particles which for the time are associated with it are fully sufficient to account for all the effects  1381 we have now arrived at the important question how will the inductive tension requisite for insulation and disruptive discharge be sustained in gases which having the same physical state and also the same pressure and the same temperature as air differ from it in specific gravity in chemical qualities and it may be in peculiar relations which not being as yet recognized are purely electrical 1361  1382 into this question i can enter now only as far as is essential for the present argument namely that insulation and inductive tension do not depend merely upon the charged conductors employed but also and essentially upon the interposed dielectric in consequence of the molecular action of its particles 1292  1383 a glass vessel a fig 127a was ground at the top and bottom so as to be closed by two ground brass plates b and c b carried a stuffingbox with a sliding rod d terminated by a brass ball s below and a ring above the lower plate was connected with a foot stopcock and socket e f and g and also with a brass ball l which by means of a stem attached to it and entering the socket g could be fixed at various heights the metallic parts of this apparatus were not varnished but the glass was wellcovered with a coat of shelllac previously dissolved in alcohol on exhausting the vessel at the airpump it could be filled with any other gas than air and in such cases the gas so passed in was dried whilst entering by fused chloride of calcium    a the drawing is to a scale of 16  1384 the other part of the apparatus consisted of two insulating pillars h and i to which were fixed two brass balls and through these passed two sliding rods k and m terminated at each end by brass balls n is the end of an insulated conductor which could be rendered either positive or negative from an electrical machine o and p are wires connecting it with the two parts previously described and q is a wire which connecting the two opposite sides of the collateral arrangements also communicates with a good discharging train r 292  1385 it is evident that the discharge from the machine electricity may pass either between s and l or s and l the regulation adopted in the first experiments was to keep s and l with their distance unchanged but to introduce first one gas and then another into the vessel a and then balance the discharge at the one place against that at the other for by making the interval at a sufficiently small all the discharge would pass there or making it sufficiently large it would all occur at the interval v in the receiver on principle it seemed evident that in this way the varying interval u might be taken as a measure or rather indication of the resistance to discharge through the gas at the constant interval v the following are the constant dimensions    ball s        093 of an inch   ball s          096 of an inch   ball l        202 of an inch   ball l          062 of an inch   interval v    062 of an inch  1386 on proceeding to experiment it was found that when air or any gas was in the receiver a the interval u was not a fixed one it might be altered through a certain range of distance and yet sparks pass either there or at v in the receiver the extremes were therefore noted ie the greatest distance short of that at which the discharge always took place at v in the gas and the least distance short of that at which it always took place at u in the air thus with air in the receiver the extremes at u were 056 and 079 of an inch the range of 023 between these distances including intervals at which sparks passed occasionally either at one place or the other  1387 the small balls s and s could be rendered either positive or negative from the machine and as gases were expected and were found to differ from each other in relation to this change 1399 the results obtained under these differences of charge were also noted  1388 the following is a table of results the gas named is that in the vessel a the smallest greatest and mean interval at u in air is expressed in parts of an inch the interval v being constantly 062 of an inch                                    smallest   greatest

0780   olefiant gas s and s pos      066       127       0965  i did not notice the difference of the barometer on the days of experimenta    a similar experiments in different gases are described at 1507   1508dec 1838  1390 one would have expected only two distances one for each interval for which the discharge might happen either at one or the other and that the least alteration of either would immediately cause one to predominate constantly over the other but that under common circumstances is not the case with air in the receiver the variation amounted to 02 of an inch nearly on the smaller interval of 06 and with muriatic acid gas the variation was above 04 on the smaller interval of 09 why is it that when a fixed interval the one in the receiver will pass a spark that cannot go across 06 of air at one time it will immediately after and apparently under exactly similar circumstances not pass a spark that can go across 08 of air  1391 it is probable that part of this variation will be traced to particles of dust in the air drawn into and about the circuit 1568 i believe also that part depends upon a variable charged condition of the surface of the glass vessel a that the whole of the effect is not traceable to the influence of circumstances in the vessel a may be deduced from the fact that when sparks occur between balls in free air they frequently are not straight and often pass otherwise than by the shortest distance these variations in air itself and at different parts of the very same balls show the presence and influence of circumstances which are calculated to produce effects of the kind now under consideration  1392 when a spark had passed at either interval then generally more tended to appear at the same interval as if a preparation had been made for the passing of the latter sparks so also on continuing to work the machine quickly the sparks generally followed at the same place this effect is probably due in part to the warmth of the air heated by the preceding spark in part to dust and i suspect in part to something unperceived as yet in the circumstances of discharge  1393 a very remarkable difference which is constant in its direction occurs when the electricity communicated to the balls s and s is changed from positive to negative or in the contrary direction it is that the range of variation is always greater when the small bulls are positive than when they are negative this is exhibited in the following table drawn from the former experiments                             pos      neg in air the range was       019      009    oxygen                  019      002    nitrogen                018      011    hydrogen                014      005    carbonic acid           016      002    olefiant gas            022      008    coal gas                024      012    muriatic acid           043      008  i have no doubt these numbers require considerable correction but the general result is striking and the differences in several cases very great                                       1394 though in consequence of the variation of the striking distance 1386 the interval in air fails to be a measure as yet of the insulating or resisting power of the gas in the vessel yet we may for present purposes take the mean interval as representing in some degree that power on examining these mean intervals as they are given in the third column 1388 it will be very evident that gases when employed as dielectrics have peculiar electrical relations to insulation and therefore to induction very distinct from such as might be supposed to depend upon their mere physical qualities of specific gravity or pressure  1395 first it is clear that at the same pressure they are not alike the difference being as great as 37 and 110 when the small balls are charged positively and with the same surfaces and the same pressure muriatic acid gas has three times the insulating or restraining power 1362 of hydrogen gas and nearly twice that of oxygen nitrogen or air  1396 yet it is evident that the difference is not due to specific gravity for though hydrogen is the lowest and therefore lower than oxygen oxygen is much beneath nitrogen or olefiant gas and carbonic acid gas though considerably heavier than olefiant gas or muriatic acid gas is lower than either oxygen as a heavy and olefiant as a light gas are in strong contrast with each other and if we may reason of olefiant gas from harriss results with air 1365 then it might be rarefied to twothirds its usual density or to a specific gravity of 93 hydrogen being 1 and having neither the same density nor pressure as oxygen would have equal insulating powers with it or equal tendency to resist discharge  1397 experiments have already been described 1291 1292 which show that the gases are sensibly alike in their inductive capacity this result is not in contradiction with the existence of great differences in their restraining power the same point has been observed already in regard to dense and rare air 1375  1398 hence arises a new argument proving that it cannot be mere pressure of the atmosphere which prevents or governs discharge 1377 1378 but a specific electric quality or relation of the gaseous medium hence also additional argument for the theory of molecular inductive action  1399 other specific differences amongst the gases may be drawn from the preceding series of experiments rough and hasty as they are thus the positive and negative series of mean intervals do not give the same differences it has been already noticed that the negative numbers are lower than the positive 1393 but besides that the order of the positive and negative results is not the same thus on comparing the mean numbers which represent for the present insulating tension it appears that in air hydrogen carbonic acid olefiant gas and muriatic acid the tension rose higher when the smaller ball was made positive than when rendered negative whilst in oxygen nitrogen and coal gas the reverse was the case now though the numbers cannot be trusted as exact and though air oxygen and nitrogen should probably be on the same side yet some of the results as for instance those with muriatic acid fully show a peculiar relation and difference amongst gases in this respect this was further proved by making the interval in air 08 of an inch whilst muriatic acid gas was in the vessel a for on charging the small balls s and s positively all the discharge took place through the air but on charging them negatively all the discharge took place through the muriatic acid gas  1400 so also when the conductor n was connected only with the muriatic acid gas apparatus it was found that the discharge was more facile when the small ball s was negative than when positive for in the latter case much of the electricity passed off as brush discharge through the air from the connecting wire p but in the former case it all seemed to go through the muriatic acid  1401 the consideration however of positive and negative discharge across air and other gases will be resumed in the further part of this or in the next paper 1465 1525  1402 here for the present i must leave this part of the subject which had for its object only to observe how far gases agreed or differed as to their power of retaining a charge on bodies acting by induction through them all the results conspire to show that induction is an action of contiguous molecules 1295 c but besides confirming this the first principle placed for proof in the present inquiry they greatly assist in developing the specific properties of each gaseous dielectric at the same time showing that further and extensive experimental investigation is necessary and holding out the promise of new discovery as the reward of the labour required                                       1403 when we pass from the consideration of dielectrics like the gases to that of bodies having the liquid and solid condition then our reasonings in the present state of the subject assume much more of the character of mere supposition still i do not perceive anything adverse to the theory in the phenomena which such bodies present if we take three insulating dielectrics as air oil of turpentine and shelllac and use the same balls or conductors at the same intervals in these three substances increasing the intensity of the induction until discharge take place we shall find that it must be raised much higher in the fluid than for the gas and higher still in the solid than for the fluid nor is this inconsistent with the theory for with the liquid though its molecules are free to move almost as easily as those of the gas there are many more particles introduced into the given interval and such is also the case when the solid body is employed besides that with the solid the cohesive force of the body used will produce some effect for though the production of the polarized states in the particle of a solid may not be obstructed but on the contrary may in some cases be even favoured 1164 1344 by its solidity or other circumstances yet solidity may well exert an influence on the point of final subversion just as it prevents discharge in an electrolyte and so enable inductive intensity to rise to a much higher degree  1404 in the cases of solids and liquids too bodies may and most probably do possess specific differences as to their ability of assuming the polarized state and also as to the extent to which that polarity must rise before discharge occurs an analogous difference exists in the specific inductive capacities already pointed out in a few substances 1278 in the last paper such a difference might even account for the various degrees of insulating and conducting power possessed by different bodies and if it should be found to exist would add further strength to the argument in favour of the molecular theory of inductive action                                       1405 having considered these various cases of sustained insulation in nonconducting dielectrics up to the highest point which they can attain we find that they terminate at last in disruptive discharge the peculiar condition of the molecules of the dielectric which was necessary to the continuous induction being equally essential to the occurrence of that effect which closes all the phenomena this discharge is not only in its appearance and condition different to the former modes by which the lowering of the powers was effected 1320 1343 but whilst really the same in principle varies much from itself in certain characters and thus presents us with the forms of spark brush and glow 1359 i will first consider the spark limiting it for the present to the case of discharge between two oppositely electrified conducting surfaces  the electric spark or flash  1406 the spark is consequent upon a discharge or lowering of the polarized inductive state of many dielectric particles by a particular action of a few of the particles occupying a very small and limited space all the previously polarized particles returning to their first or normal condition in the inverse order in which they left it and uniting their powers meanwhile to produce or rather to continue 14171436 the discharge effect in the place where the subversion of force first occurred my impression is that the few particles situated where discharge occurs are not merely pushed apart but assume a peculiar state a highly exulted condition for the time ie have thrown upon them all the surrounding forces in succession and rising up to a proportionate intensity of condition perhaps equal to that of chemically combining atoms discharge the powers possibly in the same manner as they do theirs by some operation at present unknown to us and so the end of the whole the ultimate effect is exactly as if a metallic wire had been put into the place of the discharging particles and it does not seem impossible that the principles of action in both cases may hereafter prove to be the same  1407 the path of the spark or of the discharge depends on the degree of tension acquired by the particles in the line of discharge circumstances which in every common case are very evident and by the theory easy to understand rendering it higher in them than in their neighbours and by exalting them first to the requisite condition causing them to determine the course of the discharge hence the selection of the path and the solution of the wonder which harris has so well describeda as existing under the old theory all is prepared amongst the molecules beforehand by the prior induction for the path either of the electric spark or of lightning itself    a nautical magazine 1834 p 229  1408 the same difficulty is expressed as a principle by nobili for voltaic electricity almost in mr harriss words namelya electricity directs itself towards the point where it can most easily discharge itself and the results of this as a principle he has well wrought out for the case of voltaic currents but the solution of the difficulty or the proximate cause of the effects is the same induction brings the particles up to or towards a certain degree of tension 1370 and by those which first attain it is the discharge first and most efficiently performed    a bibliothèque universelle 1835 lix 275  1409 the moment of discharge is probably determined by that molecule of the dielectric which from the circumstances has its tension most quickly raised up to the maximum intensity in all cases where the discharge passes from conductor to conductor this molecule must be on the surface of one of them but when it passes between a conductor and a nonconductor it is perhaps not always so 1453 when this particle has acquired its maximum tension then the whole barrier of resistance is broken down in the line or lines of inductive action originating at it and disruptive discharge occurs 1370 and such an inference drawn as it is from the theory seems to me in accordance with mr harriss facts and conclusions respecting the resistance of the atmosphere namely that it is not really greater at any one discharging distance than anothera    a philosophical transactions 1834 pp 227 229  1410 it seems probable that the tension of a particle of the same dielectric as air which is requisite to produce discharge is a constant quantity whatever the shape of the part of the conductor with which it is in contact whether ball or point whatever the thickness or depth of dielectric throughout which induction is exerted perhaps even whatever the state as to rarefaction or condensation of the dielectric and whatever the nature of the conductor good or bad with which the particle is for the moment associated in saying so much i do not mean to exclude small differences which may be caused by the reaction of neighbouring particles on the deciding particle and indeed it is evident that the intensity required in a particle must be related to the condition of those which are contiguous but if the expectation should be found to approximate to truth what a generality of character it presents and in the definiteness of the power possessed by a particular molecule may we not hope to find an immediate relation to the force which being electrical is equally definite and constitutes chemical affinity  1411 theoretically it would seem that at the moment of discharge by the spark in one line of inductive force not merely would all the other lines throw their forces into this one 1406 but the lateral effect equivalent to a repulsion of these lines 1224 1297 would be relieved and perhaps followed by a contrary action amounting to a collapse or attraction of these parts having long sought for some transverse force in statical electricity which should be the equivalent to magnetism or the transverse force of current electricity and conceiving that it might be connected with the transverse action of the lines of inductive force already described 1297 i was desirous by various experiments of bringing out the effect of such a force and making it tell upon the phenomena of electromagnetism and magnetoelectricitya    a see further investigations of this subject 16581666   17091735dec 1838  1412 amongst other results i expected and sought for the mutual affection or even the lateral coalition of two similar sparks if they could be obtained simultaneously side by side and sufficiently near to each other for this purpose two similar leyden jars were supplied with rods of copper projecting from their balls in a horizontal direction the rods being about 02 of an inch thick and rounded at the ends the jars were placed upon a sheet of tinfoil and so adjusted that their rods a and b were near together in the position represented in plan at fig 116 c and d were two brass balls connected by a brass rod and insulated e was also a brass ball connected by a wire with the ground and with the tinfoil upon which the leyden jars were placed by laying an insulated metal rod across from a to b charging the jars and removing the rod both the jars could be brought up to the same intensity of charge 1370 then making the ball e approach the ball d at the moment the spark passed there two sparks passed between the rods n o and the ball c and as far as the eye could judge or the conditions determine they were simultaneous  1413 under these circumstances two modes of discharge took place either each end had its own particular spark to the ball or else one end only was associated by a spark with the ball but was at the same time related to the other end by a spark between the two  1414 when the ball c was about an inch in diameter the ends n and o about half an inch from it and about 04 of an inch from each other the two sparks to the ball could be obtained when for the purpose of bringing the sparks nearer together the ends n and o were brought closer to each other then unless very carefully adjusted only one end had a spark with the ball the other having a spark to it and the least variation of position would cause either n or o to be the end which giving the direct spark to the ball was also the one through or by means of which the other discharged its electricity  1415 on making the ball c smaller i found that then it was needful to make the interval between the ends n and o larger in proportion to the distance between them and the ball c on making c larger i found i could diminish the interval and so bring the two simultaneous separate sparks closer together until at last the distance between them was not more at the widest part than 06 of their whole length  1416 numerous sparks were then passed and carefully observed they were very rarely straight but either curved or bent irregularly in the average of cases they were i think decidedly convex towards each other perhaps twothirds presented more or less of this effect the rest bulging more or less outwards i was never able however to obtain sparks which separately leaving the ends of the wires n and o conjoined into one spark before they reached or communicated with the ball c at present therefore though i think i saw a tendency in the sparks to unite i cannot assert it as a fact  1417 but there is one very interesting effect here analogous to and it may be in part the same with that i was searching for i mean the increased facility of discharge where the spark passes for instance in the cases where one end as n discharged the electricity of both ends to the ball c fig 116 the electricity of the other end o had to pass through an interval of air 15 times as great as that which it might have taken by its direct passage between the end and the ball itself in such cases the eye could not distinguish even by the use of wheatstones meansa that the spark from the end n which contained both portions of electricity was a double spark it could not have consisted of two sparks taking separate courses for such an effect would have been visible to the eye but it is just possible that the spark of the first end n and its jar passing at the smallest interval of time before that of the other o had heated and expanded the air in its course and made it so much more favourable to discharge that the electricity of the end o preferred leaping across to it and taking a very circuitous route rather than the more direct one to the ball it must however be remarked in answer to this supposition that the one spark between d and e would by its influence tend to produce simultaneous discharges at n and o and certainly did so when no preponderance was given to one wire over the other as to the previous inductive effect 1414    a philosophical transactions 1834 pp 584 585  1418 the fact however is that disruptive discharge is favourable to itself it is at the outset a case of tottering equilibrium and if time be an element in discharge in however minute a proportion 1436 then the commencement of the act at any point favours its continuance and increase there and portions of power will be discharged by a course which they would not otherwise have taken  1419 the mere heating and expansion of the air itself by the first portion of electricity which passes must have a great influence in producing this result  1420 as to the result itself we see its effect in every electric spark for it is not the whole quantity which passes that determines the discharge but merely that small portion of force which brings the deciding molecule 1370 up to its maximum tension then when its forces are subverted and discharge begins all the rest passes by the same course from the influence of the favouring circumstances just referred to and whether it be the electricity on a square inch or a thousand square inches of charged glass the discharge is complete hereafter we shall find the influence of this effect in the formation of brushes 1435 and it is not impossible that we may trace it producing the jagged spark and the forked lightning                                       1421 the characters of the electric spark in different gases vary and the variation may be due simply to the effect of the heat evolved at the moment but it may also be due to that specific relation of the particles and the electric forces which i have assumed as the basis of a theory of induction the facts do not oppose such a view and in that view the variation strengthens the argument for molecular action as it would seem to show the influence of the latter in every part of the electrical effect 1423 1454  1422 the appearances of the sparks in different gases have often been observed and recordeda but i think it not out of place to notice briefly the following results they were obtained with balls of brass platina surfaces would have been better and at common pressures in air the sparks have that intense light and bluish colour which are so well known and often have faint or dark parts in their course when the quantity of electricity passing is not great in nitrogen they are very beautiful having the same general appearance as in air but have decidedly more colour of a bluish or purple character and i thought were remarkably sonorous in oxygen the sparks were whiter than in air or nitrogen and i think not so brilliant in hydrogen they had a very fine crimson colour not due to its rarity for the character passed away as the atmosphere was rarefied 1459b very little sound was produced in this gas but that is a consequence of its physical conditionc in carbonic acid gas the colour was similar to that of the spark in air but with a little green in it the sparks were remarkably irregular in form more so than in common air they could also under similar circumstances as to size of ball c be obtained much longer than in air the gas showing a singular readiness to cause the discharge in the form of spark in muriatic acid gas the spark was nearly white it was always bright throughout never presenting those dark parts which happen in air nitrogen and some other gases the gas was dry and during the whole experiment the surface of the glass globe within remained quite dry and bright in coal gas the spark was sometimes green sometimes red and occasionally one part was green and another red black parts also occur very suddenly in the line of the spark ie they are not connected by any dull part with bright portions but the two seem to join directly one with the other    a see van marums description of the teylerian machine vol i p   112 and vol ii p 196 also ency britan vol vi article   electricity pp 505 507    b van marum says they are about four times as large in hydrogen as   in air vol i p 122    c leslie cambridge phil transactions 267  1423 these varieties of character impress my mind with a feeling that they are due to a direct relation of the electric powers to the particles of the dielectric through which the discharge occurs and are not the mere results of a casual ignition or a secondary kind of action of the electricity upon the particles which it finds in its course and thrusts aside in its passage 1454  1424 the spark may be obtained in media which are far denser than air as in oil of turpentine olive oil resin glass c it may also be obtained in bodies which being denser likewise approximate to the condition of conductors as spermaceti water c but in these cases nothing occurs which as far as i can perceive is at all hostile to the general views i have endeavoured to advocate  the electrical brush  1425 the brush is the next form of disruptive discharge which i shall consider there are many ways of obtaining it or rather of exalting its characters and all these ways illustrate the principles upon which it is produced if an insulated conductor connected with the positive conductor of an electrical machine have a metal rod 03 of an inch in diameter projecting from it outwards from the machine and terminating by a rounded end or a small ball it will generally give good brushes or if the machine be not in good action then many ways of assisting the formation of the brush can be resorted to thus the hand or any large conducting surface may be approached towards the termination to increase inductive force 1374 or the termination may be smaller and of badly conducting matter as wood or sparks may be taken between the prime conductor of the machine and the secondary conductor to which the termination giving brushes belongs or which gives to the brushes exceedingly fine characters and great magnitude the air around the termination may be rarefied more or less either by heat or the airpump the former favourable circumstances being also continued  1426 the brush when obtained by a powerful machine on a ball about 07 of an inch in diameter at the end of a long brass rod attached to the positive prime conductor had the general appearance as to form represented in fig 117 a short conical bright part or root appeared at the middle part of the ball projecting directly from it which at a little distance from the ball broke out suddenly into a wide brush of pale ramifications having a quivering motion and being accompanied at the same time with a low dull chattering sound  1427 at first the brush seems continuous but professor wheatstone has shown that the whole phenomenon consists of successive intermitting dischargesa if the eye be passed rapidly not by a motion of the head but of the eyeball itself across the direction of the brush by first looking steadfastly about 10° or 15° above and then instantly as much below it the general brush will be resolved into a number of individual brushes standing in a row upon the line which the eye passed over each elementary brush being the result of a single discharge and the space between them representing both the time during which the eye was passing over that space and that which elapsed between one discharge and another    a philosophical transactions 1834 p 586  1428 the single brushes could easily be separated to eight or ten times their own width but were not at the same time extended ie they did not become more indefinite in shape but on the contrary less so each being more distinct in form ramification and character because of its separation from the others in its effects upon the eye each therefore was instantaneous in its existence 1436 each had the conical root complete 1426  1429 on using a smaller ball the general brush was smaller and the sound though weaker more continuous on resolving the brush into its elementary parts as before these were found to occur at much shorter intervals of time than in the former case but still the discharge was intermitting  1430 employing a wire with a round end the brush was still smaller but as before separable into successive discharges the sound though feebler was higher in pitch being a distinct musical note  1431 the sound is in fact due to the recurrence of the noise of each separate discharge and these happening at intervals nearly equal under ordinary circumstances cause a definite note to be heard which rising in pitch with the increased rapidity and regularity of the intermitting discharges gives a ready and accurate measure of the intervals and so may be used in any case when the discharge is heard even though the appearances may not be seen to determine the element of time so when by bringing the hand towards a projecting rod or ball the pitch of the tone produced by a brushy discharge increases the effect informs us that we have increased the induction 1374 and by that means increased the rapidity of the alternations of charge and discharge  1432 by using wires with finer terminations smaller brushes were obtained until they could hardly be distinguished as brushes but as long as sound was heard the discharge could be ascertained by the eye to be intermitting and when the sound ceased the light became continuous as a glow 1359 1405 15261543  1433 to those not accustomed to use the eye in the manner i have described or in cases where the recurrence is too quick for any unassisted eye the beautiful revolving mirror of professor wheatstonea will be useful for such developments of condition as those mentioned above another excellent process is to produce the brush or other luminous phenomenon on the end of a rod held in the hand opposite to a charged positive or negative conductor and then move the rod rapidly from side to side whilst the eye remains still the successive discharges occur of course in different places and the state of things before at and after a single coruscation or brush can be exceedingly well separated    a philosophical transactions 1834 pp 581 585  1434 the brush is in reality a discharge between a bad or a nonconductor and either a conductor or another nonconductor under common circumstances the brush is a discharge between a conductor and air and i conceive it to take place in something like the following manner when the end of an electrified rod projects into the middle of a room induction takes place between it and the walls of the room across the dielectric air and the lines of inductive force accumulate upon the end in greater quantity than elsewhere or the particles of air at the end of the rod are more highly polarized than those at any other part of the rod for the reasons already given 1374 the particles of air situated in sections across these lines of force are least polarized in the sections towards the walls and most polarized in those nearer to the end of the wires 1369 thus it may well happen that a particle at the end of the wire is at a tension that will immediately terminate in discharge whilst in those even only a few inches off the tension is still beneath that point but suppose the rod to be charged positively a particle of air a fig 118 next it being polarized and having of course its negative force directed towards the rod and its positive force outwards the instant that discharge takes place between the positive force of the particle of the rod opposite the air and the negative force of the particle of air towards the rod the whole particle of air becomes positively electrified and when the next instant the discharged part of the rod resumes its positive state by conduction from the surface of metal behind it not only acts on the particles beyond a by throwing a into a polarized state again but a itself because of its charged state exerts a distinct inductive act towards these further particles and the tension is consequently so much exalted between a and b that discharge takes place there also as well as again between the metal and a  1435 in addition to this effect it has been shown that the act of discharge having once commenced the whole operation like a case of unstable equilibrium is hastened to a conclusion 1370 1418 the rest of the act being facilitated in its occurrence and other electricity than that which caused the first necessary tension hurrying to the spot when therefore disruptive discharge has once commenced at the root of a brush the electric force which has been accumulating in the conductor attached to the rod finds a more ready discharge there than elsewhere and will at once follow the course marked out as it were for it thus leaving the conductor in a partially discharged state and the air about the end of the wire in a charged condition and the time necessary for restoring the full charge of the conductor and the dispersion of the charged air in a greater or smaller degree by the joint forces of repulsion from the conductor and attraction towards the walls of the room to which its inductive action is directed is just that time which forms the interval between brush and brush 1420 1427 1431 1447  1436 the words of this description are long but there is nothing in the act or the forces on which it depends to prevent the discharge being instantaneous as far as we can estimate and measure it the consideration of time is however important in several points of view 1418 and in reference to disruptive discharge it seemed from theory far more probable that it might be detected in a brush than in a spark for in a brush the particles in the line through which the discharge passes are in very different states as to intensity and the discharge is already complete in its act at the root of the brush before the particles at the extremity of the ramifications have yet attained their maximum intensity  1437 i consider brush discharge as probably a successive effect in this way discharge begins at the root 1426 1553 and extending itself in succession to all parts of the single brush continues to go on at the root and the previously formed parts until the whole brush is complete then by the fall in intensity and power at the conductor it ceases at once in all parts to be renewed when that power has risen again to a sufficient degree but in a spark the particles in the line of discharge being from the circumstances nearly alike in their intensity of polarization suffer discharge so nearly at the same moment as to make the time quite insensible to us  1438 mr wheatstone has already made experiments which fully illustrate this point he found that the brush generally had a sensible duration but that with his highest capabilities he could not detect any such effect in the sparka i repeated his experiment on the brush though with more imperfect means to ascertain whether i could distinguish a longer duration in the stem or root of the brush than in the extremities and the appearances were such as to make me think an effect of this kind was produced    a philosophical transactions 1836 pp 586 590  1439 that the discharge breaks into several ramifications and by them passes through portions of air alike or nearly alike as to polarization and the degree of tension the particles there have acquired is a very natural result of the previous state of things and rather to be expected than that the discharge should continue to go straight out into space in a single line amongst those particles which being at a distance from the end of the rod are in a lower state of tension than those which are near and whilst we cannot but conclude that those parts where the branches of a single brush appear are more favourably circumstanced for discharge than the darker parts between the ramifications we may also conclude that in those parts where the light of concomitant discharge is equal there the circumstances are nearly equal also the single successive brushes are by no means of the same particular shape even when they are observed without displacement of the rod or surrounding objects 1427 1433 and the successive discharges may be considered as taking place into the mass of air around through different roads at each brush according as minute circumstances such as dust c 1391 1392 may have favoured the course by one set of particles rather than another  1440 brush discharge does not essentially require any current of the medium in which the brush appears the current almost always occurs but is a consequence of the brush and will be considered hereafter 15621610 on holding a blunt point positively charged towards uninsulated water a star or glow appeared on the point a current of air passed from it and the surface of the water was depressed but on bringing the point so near that sonorous brushes passed then the current of air instantly ceased and the surface of the water became level  1441 the discharge by a brush is not to all the particles of air that are near the electrified conductor from which the brush issues only those parts where the ramifications pass are electrified the air in the central dark parts between them receives no charge and in fact at the time of discharge has its electric and inductive tension considerably lowered for consider fig 128 to represent a single positive brushthe induction before the discharge is from the end of the rod outwards in diverging lines towards the distant conductors as the walls of the room c and a particle at a has polarity of a certain degree of tension and tends with a certain force to become charged but at the moment of discharge the air in the ramifications b and d acquiring also a positive state opposes its influence to that of the positive conductor on a and the tension of the particle at a is therefore diminished rather than increased the charged particles at b and d are now inductive bodies but their lines of inductive action are still outwards towards the walls of the room the direction of the polarity and the tendency of other particles to charge from these being governed by or in conformity with these lines of force  1442 the particles that are charged are probably very highly charged but the medium being a nonconductor they cannot communicate that state to their neighbours they travel therefore under the influence of the repulsive and attractive forces from the charged conductor towards the nearest uninsulated conductor or the nearest body in a different state to themselves just as charged particles of dust would travel and are then discharged each particle acting in its course as a centre of inductive force upon any bodies near which it may come the travelling of these charged particles when they are numerous causes wind and currents but these will come into consideration under carrying discharge 1319 1562 c  1443 when air is said to be electrified and it frequently assumes this state near electrical machines it consists according to my view of a mixture of electrified and unelectrified particles the latter being in very large proportion to the former when we gather electricity from air by a flame or by wires it is either by the actual discharge of these particles or by effects dependent on their inductive action a case of either kind being produceable at pleasure that the law of equality between the two forces or forms of force in inductive action is as strictly preserved in these as in other cases is fully shown by the fact formerly stated 1173 1174 that however strongly air in a vessel might be charged positively there was an exactly equal amount of negative force on the inner surface of the vessel itself for no residual portion of either the one or the other electricity could be obtained  1444 i have nowhere said nor does it follow that the air is charged only where the luminous brush appears the charging may extend beyond those parts which are visible ie particles to the right or left of the lines of light may receive electricity the parts which are luminous being so only because much electricity is passing by them to other parts 1437 just as in a spark discharge the light is greater as more electricity passes though it has no necessary relation to the quantity required to commence discharge 1370 1420 hence the form we see in a brush may by no means represent the whole quantity of air electrified for an invisible portion clothing the visible form to a certain depth may at the same time receive its charge 1552  1445 several effects which i have met with in muriatic acid gas tend to make me believe that that gaseous body allows of a dark discharge at the same time it is quite clear from theory that in some gases the reverse of this may occur ie that the charging of the air may not extend even so far as the light we do not know as yet enough of the electric light to be able to state on what it depends and it is very possible that when electricity bursts forth into air all the particles of which are in a state of tension light may be evolved by such as being very near to are not of those which actually receive a charge at the time  1446 the further a brush extends in a gas the further no doubt is the charge or discharge carried forward but this may vary between different gases and yet the intensity required for the first moment of discharge not vary in the same but in some other proportion thus with respect to nitrogen and muriatic acid gases the former as far as my experiments have proceeded produces far finer and larger brushes than the latter 1458 1462 but the intensity required to commence discharge is much higher for the muriatic acid than the nitrogen 1395 here again therefore as in many other qualities specific differences are presented by different gaseous dielectrics and so prove the special relation of the latter to the act and the phenomena of induction  1447 to sum up these considerations respecting the character and condition of the brush i may state that it is a spark to air a diffusion of electric force to matter not by conduction but disruptive discharge a dilute spark which passing to very badly conducting matter frequently discharges but a small portion of the power stored up in the conductor for as the air charged reacts on the conductor whilst the conductor by loss of electricity sinks in its force 1435 the discharge quickly ceases until by the dispersion of the charged air and the renewal of the excited conditions of the conductor circumstances have risen up to their first effective condition again to cause discharge and again to fall and rise  1448 the brush and spark gradually pass into one another making a small ball positive by a good electrical machine with a large prime conductor and approaching a large uninsulated discharging ball towards it very beautiful variations from the spark to the brush may be obtained the drawings of long and powerful sparks given by van maruma harrisb and others also indicate the same phenomena as far as i have observed whenever the spark has been brushy in air of common pressures the whole of the electricity has not been discharged but only portions of it more or less according to circumstances whereas whenever the effect has been a distinct spark throughout the whole of its course the discharge has been perfect provided no interruption had been made to it elsewhere in the discharging circuit than where the spark occurred    a description of the teylerian machine vol i pp 28 32 vol   ii p 226 c    b philosophical transactions 1834 p 213  1449 when an electrical brush from an inch to six inches in length or more is issuing into free air it has the form given fig 117 but if the hand a ball of any knobbed conductor be brought near the extremities of the coruscations turn towards it and each other and the whole assumes various forms according to circumstances as in figs 119 120 and 121 the influence of the circumstances in each case is easily traced and i might describe it here but that i should be ashamed to occupy the time of the society in things so evident but how beautifully does the curvature of the ramifications illustrate the curved form of the lines of inductive force existing previous to the discharge for the former are consequences of the latter and take their course in each discharge where the previous inductive tension had been raised to the proper degree they represent these curves just as well as iron filings represent magnetic curves the visible effects in both cases being the consequences of the action of the forces in the places where the effects appear the phenomena therefore constitute additional and powerful testimony 1216 1230 to that already given in favour both of induction through dielectrics in curved lines 1231 and of the lateral relation of these lines by an effect equivalent to a repulsion producing divergence or as in the cases figured the bulging form  1450 in reference to the theory of molecular inductive action i may also add the proof deducible from the long brushy ramifying spark which may be obtained between a small ball on the positive conductor of an electrical machine and a larger one at a distance 1448 1504 what a fine illustration that spark affords of the previous condition of all the particles of the dielectric between the surfaces of discharge and how unlike the appearances are to any which would be deduced from the theory which assumes inductive action to be action at a distance in straight lines only and charge as being electricity retained upon the surface of conductors by the mere pressure of the atmosphere                                       1451 when the brush is obtained in rarefied air the appearances vary greatly according to circumstances and are exceedingly beautiful sometimes a brush may be formed of only six or seven branches these being broad and highly luminous of a purple colour and in some parts an inch or more apart by a spark discharge at the prime conductor 1455 single brushes may be obtained at pleasure discharge in the form of a brush is favoured by rarefaction of the air in the same manner and for the same reason as discharge in the form of a spark 1375 but in every case there is previous induction and charge through the dielectric and polarity of its particles 1437 the induction being as in any other instance alternately raised by the machine and lowered by the discharge in certain experiments the rarefaction was increased to the utmost degree and the opposed conducting surfaces brought as near together as possible without producing glow 1529 the brushes then contracted in their lateral dimensions and recurred so rapidly as to form an apparently continuous arc of light from metal to metal still the discharge could be observed to intermit 1427 so that even under these high conditions induction preceded each single brush and the tense polarized condition of the contiguous particles was a necessary preparation for the discharge itself  1452 the brush form of disruptive discharge may be obtained not only in air and gases but also in much denser media i procured it in oil of turpentine from the end of a wire going through a glass tube into the fluid contained in a metal vessel the brush was small and very difficult to obtain the ramifications were simple and stretched out from each other diverging very much the light was exceedingly feeble a perfectly dark room being required for its observation when a few solid particles as of dust or silk were in the liquid the brush was produced with much greater facility  1453 the running together or coalescence of different lines of discharge 1412 is very beautifully shown in the brush in air this point may present a little difficulty to those who are not accustomed to see in every discharge an equal exertion of power in opposite directions a positive brush being considered by such perhaps in consequence of the common phrase direction of a current as indicating a breaking forth in different directions of the original force rather than a tendency to convergence and union in one line of passage but the ordinary case of the brush may be compared for its illustration with that in which by holding the knuckle opposite to highly excited glass a discharge occurs the ramifications of a brush then leading from the glass and converging into a spark on the knuckle though a difficult experiment to make it is possible to obtain discharge between highly excited shelllac and the excited glass of a machine when the discharge passes it is from the nature of the charged bodies brush at each end and spark in the middle beautifully illustrating that tendency of discharge to facilitate like action which i have described in a former page 1418  1454 the brush has specific characters in different gases indicating a relation to the particles of these bodies even in a stronger degree than the spark 1422 1423 this effect is in strong contrast with the nonvariation caused by the use of different substances as conductors from which the brushes are to originate thus using such bodies as wood card charcoal nitre citric acid oxalic acid oxide of lead chloride of lead carbonate of potassa potassa fusa strong solution of potash oil of vitriol sulphur sulphuret of antimony and hæmatite no variation in the character of the brushes was obtained except that dependent upon their effect as better or worse conductors of causing discharge with more or less readiness and quickness from the machinea    a exception must of course be made of those cases where the root   of the brush becoming a spark causes a little diffusion or even   decomposition of the matter there and so gains more or less of a   particular colour at that part  1455 the following are a few of the effects i observed in different gasses at the positively charged surfaces and with atmospheres varying in their pressure the general effect of rarefaction was the same for all the gases at first sparks passed these gradually were converted into brushes which became larger and more distinct in their ramifications until upon further rarefaction the latter began to collapse and draw in upon each other till they formed a stream across from conductor to conductor then a few lateral streams shot out towards the glass of the vessel from the conductors these became thick and soft in appearance and were succeeded by the full constant glow which covered the discharging wire the phenomena varied with the size of the vessel 1477 the degree of rarefaction and the discharge of electricity from the machine when the latter was in successive sparks they were most beautiful the effect of a spark from a small machine being equal to and often surpassing that produced by the constant discharge of a far more powerful one  1456 airfine positive brushes are easily obtained in air at common pressures and possess the wellknown purplish light when the air is rarefied the ramifications are very long filling the globe 1477 the light is greatly increased and is of a beautiful purple colour with an occasional rose tint in it  1457 oxygenat common pressures the brush is very close and compressed and of a dull whitish colour in rarefied oxygen the form and appearance are better the colour somewhat purplish but all the characters very poor compared to those in air  1458 nitrogen gives brushes with great facility at the positive surface far beyond any other gas i have tried they are almost always fine in form light and colour and in rarefied nitrogen are magnificent they surpass the discharges in any other gas as to the quantity of light evolved  1459 hydrogen at common pressures gave a better brush than oxygen but did not equal nitrogen the colour was greenish gray in rarefied hydrogen the ramifications were very fine in form and distinctness but pale in colour with a soft and velvety appearance and not at all equal to those in nitrogen in the rarest state of the gas the colour of the light was a pale gray green  1460 coal gasthe brushes were rather difficult to produce the contrast with nitrogen being great in this respect they were short and strong generally of a greenish colour and possessing much of the spark character for occurring on both the positive and negative terminations often when there was a dark interval of some length between the two brushes still the quick sharp sound of the spark was produced as if the discharge had been sudden through this gas and partaking in that respect of the character of a spark in rare coal gas the brush forms were better but the light very poor and the colour gray  1461 carbonic acid gas produces a very poor brush at common pressures as regards either size light or colour and this is probably connected with the tendency which this gas has to discharge the electricity as a spark 1422 in rarefied carbonic acid the brush is better in form but weak as to light being of a dull greenish or purplish line varying with the pressure and other circumstances  1462 muriatic acid gasit is very difficult to obtain the brush in this gas at common pressures on gradually increasing the distance of the rounded ends the sparks suddenly ceased when the interval was about an inch and the discharge which was still through the gas in the globe was silent and dark occasionally a very short brush could for a few moments be obtained but it quickly disappeared even when the intermitting spark current 1455 from the machine was used still i could only with difficulty obtain a brush and that very short though i used rods with rounded terminations about 025 of an inch in diameter which had before given them most freely in air and nitrogen during the time of this difficulty with the muriatic gas magnificent brushes were passing off from different parts of the machine into the surrounding air on rarefying the gas the formation of the brush was facilitated but it was generally of a low squat form very poor in light and very similar on both the positive and negative surfaces on rarefying the gas still more a few large ramifications were obtained of a pale bluish colour utterly unlike those in nitrogen                                       1463 in all the gases the different forms of disruptive discharge may be linked together and gradually traced from one extreme to the other ie from the spark to the glow 1405 1526 or it may be to a still further condition to be called dark discharge 15441560 but it is nevertheless very surprising to see what a specific character each keeps whilst under the predominance of the general law thus in muriatic acid the brush is very difficult to obtain and there comes in its place almost a dark discharge partaking of the readiness of the spark action moreover in muriatic acid i have never observed the spark with any dark interval in it in nitrogen the spark readily changes its character into that of brush in carbonic acid gas there seems to be a facility to occasion spark discharge whilst yet that gas is unlike nitrogen in the facility of the latter to form brushes and unlike muriatic acid in its own facility to continue the spark these differences add further force first to the observations already made respecting the spark in various gases 1422 1423 and then to the proofs deducible from it of the relation of the electrical forces to the particles of matter  1464 the peculiar characters of nitrogen in relation to the electric discharge 1422 1458 must evidently have an important influence over the form and even the occurrence of lightning being that gas which most readily produces coruscations and by them extends discharge to a greater distance than any other gas tried it is also that which constitutes fourfifths of our atmosphere and as in atmospheric electrical phenomena one and sometimes both the inductive forces are resident on the particles of the air which though probably affected as to conducting power by the aqueous particles in it cannot be considered as a good conductor so the peculiar power possessed by nitrogen to originate and effect discharge in the form of a brush or of ramifications has probably an important relation to its electrical service in nature as it most seriously affects the character and condition of the discharge when made the whole subject of discharge from and through gases is of great interest and if only in reference to atmospheric electricity deserves extensive and close experimental investigation  difference of discharge at the positive and negative conducting surfaces  1465 i have avoided speaking of this wellknown phenomenon more than was quite necessary that i might bring together here what i have to say on the subject when the brush discharge is observed in air at the positive and negative surfaces there is a very remarkable difference the true and full comprehension of which would no doubt be of the utmost importance to the physics of electricity it would throw great light on our present subject ie the molecular action of dielectrics under induction and its consequences and seems very open to and accessible by experimental inquiry  1466 the difference in question used to be expressed in former times by saying that a point charged positively gave brushes into the air whilst the same point charged negatively gave a star this is true only of bad conductors or of metallic conductors charged intermittingly or otherwise controlled by collateral induction if metallic points project freely into the air the positive and negative light upon them differ very little in appearance and the difference can be observed only upon close examination  1467 the effect varies exceedingly under different circumstances but as we must set out from some position may perhaps be stated thus if a metallic wire with a rounded termination in free air be used to produce the brushy discharge then the brushes obtained when the wire is charged negatively are very poor and small by comparison with those produced when the charge is positive or if a large metal ball connected with the electrical machine be charged positively and a fine uninsulated point be gradually brought towards it a star appears on the point when at a considerable distance which though it becomes brighter does not change its form of a star until it is close up to the ball whereas if the ball be charged negatively the point at a considerable distance has a star on it as before but when brought nearer in my case to the distance of 112 inch a brush formed on it extending to the negative ball and when still nearer at 18 of an inch distance the brush ceased and bright sparks passed these variations i believe include the whole series of differences and they seem to show at once that the negative surface tends to retain its discharging character unchanged whilst the positive surface under similar circumstances permits of great variation  1468 there are several points in the character of the negative discharge to air which it is important to observe a metal rod 03 of an inch in diameter with a rounded end projecting into the air was charged negatively and gave a short noisy brush fig 122 it was ascertained both by sight 1427 1433 and sound 1431 that the successive discharges were very rapid in their recurrence being seven or eight times more numerous in the same period than those produced when the rod was charged positively to an equal degree when the rod was positive it was easy by working the machine a little quicker to replace the brush by a glow 1405 1463 but when it was negative no efforts could produce this change even by bringing the hand opposite the wire the only effect was to increase the number of brush discharges in a given period raising at the same time the sound to a higher pitch  1469 a point opposite the negative brush exhibited a star and as it was approximated caused the size and sound of the negative brush to diminish and at last to cease leaving the negative end silent and dark yet effective as to discharge  1470 when the round end of a smaller wire fig 123 was advanced towards the negative brush it becoming positive by induction exhibited the quiet glow at 8 inches distance the negative brush continuing when nearer the pitch of the sound of the negative brush rose indicating quicker intermittences 1431 still nearer the positive end threw off ramifications and distinct brushes at the same time the negative brush contracted in its lateral directions and collected together giving a peculiar narrow longish brush in shape like a hair pencil the two brushes existing at once but very different in their form and appearance and especially in the more rapid recurrence of the negative discharges than of the positive on using a smaller positive wire for the same experiment the glow first appeared on it and then the brush the negative brush being affected at the same time and the two at one distance became exceedingly alike in appearance and the sounds i thought were in unison at all events they were in harmony so that the intermissions of discharge were either isochronous or a simple ratio existed between the intervals with a higher action of the machine the wires being retained unaltered the negative surface became dark and silent and a glow appeared on the positive one a still higher action changed the latter into a spark finer positive wires gave other variations of these effects the description of which i must not allow myself to go into here  1471 a thinner rod was now connected with the negative conductor in place of the larger one 1468 its termination being gradually diminished to a blunt point as in fig 124 and it was beautiful to observe that notwithstanding the variation of the brush the same general order of effects was produced the end gave a small sonorous negative brush which the approach of the hand or a large conducting surface did not alter until it was so near as to produce a spark a fine point opposite to it was luminous at a distance being nearer it did not destroy the light and sound of the negative brush but only tended to have a brush produced on itself which at a still less distance passed into a spark joining the two surfaces  1472 when the distinct negative and positive brushes are produced simultaneously in relation to each other in air the former almost always has a contracted form as in fig 125 very much indeed resembling the figure which the positive brush itself has when influenced by the lateral vicinity of positive parts acting by induction thus a brush issuing from a point in the reentering angle of a positive conductor has the same compressed form fig 126  1473 the character of the negative brush is not affected by the chemical nature of the substances of the conductors 1454 but only by their possession of the conducting power in a greater or smaller degree  1474 rarefaction of common air about a negative ball or blunt point facilitated the development of the negative brush the effect being i think greater than on a positive brush though great on both extensive ramifications could be obtained from a ball or end electrified negatively to the plate of the airpump on which the jar containing it stood  1475 a very important variation of the relative forms and conditions of the positive and negative brush takes place on varying the dielectric in which they are produced the difference is so very great that it points to a specific relation of this form of discharge to the particular gas in which it takes place and opposes the idea that gases are but obstructions to the discharge acting one like another and merely in proportion to their pressure 1377  1476 in air the superiority of the positive brush is well known 1467 1472 in nitrogen it is as great or even greater than in air 1458 in hydrogen the positive brush loses a part of its superiority not being so good as in nitrogen or air whilst the negative brush does not seem injured 1459 in oxygen the positive brush is compressed and poor 1457 whilst the negative did not become less the two were so alike that the eye frequently could not tell one from the other and this similarity continued when the oxygen was gradually rarefied in coal gas the brushes are difficult of production as compared to nitrogen 1460 and the positive not much superior to the negative in its character either at common or low pressures in carbonic acid gas this approximation of character also occurred in muriatic acid gas the positive brush was very little better than the negative and both difficult to produce 1462 as compared with the facility in nitrogen or air  1477 these experiments were made with rods of brass about a quarter of an inch thick having rounded ends these being opposed in a glass globe 7 inches in diameter containing the gas to be experimented with the electric machine was used to communicate directly sometimes the positive and sometimes the negative state to the rod in connection with it  1478 thus we see that notwithstanding there is a general difference in favour of the superiority of the positive brush over the negative that difference is at its maximum in nitrogen and air whilst in carbonic acid muriatic acid coal gas and oxygen it diminishes and at last almost disappears so that in this particular effect as in all others yet examined the evidence is in favour of that view which refers the results to a direct relation of the electric forces with the molecules of the matter concerned in the action 1421 1423 1463 even when special phenomena arise under the operation of the general law the theory adopted seems fully competent to meet the case  1479 before i proceed further in tracing the probable cause of the difference between the positive and negative brush discharge i wish to know the results of a few experiments which are in course of preparation and thinking this series of researches long enough i shall here close it with the expectation of being able in a few weeks to renew the inquiry and entirely redeem my pledge 1306  royal institution dec 23rd 1837     thirteenth series   § 18 on induction

a vacuum to electrical phenomena § 19 nature of the electrical current  received february 22read march 15 1838   ¶ ix disruptive discharge continued   1480 let us now direct our attention to the general difference of the positive and negative disruptive discharge with the object of tracing as far as possible the cause of that difference and whether it depends on the charged conductors principally or on the interposed dielectric and as it appears to be great in air and nitrogen 1476 let us observe the phenomena in air first  1481 the general case is best understood by a reference to surfaces of considerable size rather than to points which involve as a secondary effect the formation of currents 1562 my investigation therefore was carried on with balls and terminations of different diameters and the following are some of the principal results  1482 if two balls of very different dimensions as for instance onehalf an inch and the other three inches in diameter be arranged at the ends of rods so that either can be electrified by a machine and made to discharge by sparks to the other which is at the same time uninsulated then as is well known far longer sparks are obtained when the small ball is positive and the large ball negative than when the small ball is negative and the large ball positive in the former case the sparks are 10 or 12 inches in length in the latter an inch or an inch and a half only                                       1483 but previous to the description of further experiments i will mention two words for which with many others i am indebted to a friend and which i think it would be expedient to introduce and use it is important in ordinary inductive action to distinguish at which charged surface the induction originates and is sustained ie if two or more metallic balls or other masses of matter are in inductive relation to express which are charged originally and which are brought by them into the opposite electrical condition i propose to call those bodies which are originally charged inductric bodies and those which assume the opposite state in consequence of the induction inducteous bodies this distinction is not needful because there is any difference between the sums of the inductric and the inducteous forces but principally because when a ball a is inductric it not merely brings a ball b which is opposite to it into an inducteous state but also many other surrounding conductors though some of them may be a considerable distance off and the consequence is that the balls do not bear the same precise relation to each other when first one and then the other is made the inductric ball though in each case the same ball be made to assume the same state  1484 another liberty which i may also occasionally take in language i will explain and limit it is that of calling a particular spark or brush positive or negative according as it may be considered as originating at a positive or a negative surface we speak of the brush as positive or negative when it shoots out from surfaces previously in those states and the experiments of mr wheatstone go to prove that it really begins at the charged surface and from thence extends into the air 1437 1438 or other dielectric according to my view sparks also originate or are determined at one particular spot 1370 namely that where the tension first rises up to the maximum degree and when this can be determined as in the simultaneous use of large and small balls in which case the discharge begins or is determined by the latter i would call that discharge which passes at once a positive spark if it was at the positive surface that the maximum intensity was first obtained or a negative spark if that necessary intensity was first obtained at the negative surface                                      1485 an apparatus was arranged as in fig 129 plate viii a and b were brass balls of very different diameters attached to metal rods moving through sockets on insulating pillars so that the distance between the balls could be varied at pleasure the large ball a 2 inches in diameter was connected with an insulated brass conductor which could be rendered positive or negative directly from a cylinder machine the small ball b 025 of an inch in diameter was connected with a discharging train 292 and perfectly uninsulated the brass rods sustaining the balls were 02 of an inch in thickness  1486 when the large ball was positive and inductric 1483 negative sparks occurred until the interval was 049 of an inch then mixed brush and spark between that and 051 and from 052 and upwards negative brush alone when the large ball was made negative and inductric then positive spark alone occurred until the interval was as great as 115 inches spark and brush from that up to 155 and to have the positive brush alone it required an interval of at least 165 inches  1487 the balls a and b were now changed for each other then making the small ball b inductric positively the positive sparks alone continued only up to 067 spark and brush occurred from 068 up to 072 and positive brush alone from 074 and upwards rendering the small ball b inductric and negative negative sparks alone occurred up to 040 then spark and brush at 042 whilst from 044 and upwards the noisy negative brush alone took place  1488 we thus find a great difference as the balls are rendered inductric or inducteous the small ball rendered positive inducteously giving a spark nearly twice as long as that produced when it was charged positive inductrically and a corresponding difference though not under the circumstances to the same extent was manifest when it was rendered negativea    a for similar experiments on different gases see 1518dec 1838  1489 other results are that the small ball rendered positive gives a much longer spark than when it is rendered negative and that the small ball rendered negative gives a brush more readily than when positive in relation to the effect produced by increasing the distance between the two balls  1490 when the interval was below 04 of an inch so that the small ball should give sparks whether positive or negative i could not observe that there was any constant difference either in their ready occurrence or the number which passed in a given time but when the interval was such that the small ball when negative gave a brush then the discharges from it as separate negative brushes were far more numerous than the corresponding discharges from it when rendered positive whether those positive discharges were as sparks or brushes  1491 it is therefore evident that when a ball is discharging electricity in the form of brushes the brushes are far more numerous and each contains or carries off far less electric force when the electricity so discharged is negative than when it is positive  1492 in all such experiments as those described the point of change from spark to brush is very much governed by the working state of the electrical machine and the size of the conductor connected with the discharging ball if the machine be in strong action and the conductor large so that much power is accumulated quickly for each discharge then the interval is greater at which the sparks are replaced by brushes but the general effect is the samea    a for similar experiments in different gases see 15101517dec   1838  1493 these results though indicative of very striking and peculiar relations of the electric force or forces do not show the relative degrees of charge which the small ball acquires before discharge occurs ie they do not tell whether it acquires a higher condition in the negative or in the positive state immediately preceding that discharge to illustrate this important point i arranged two places of discharge as represented fig 130 a and d are brass balls 2 inches diameter b and c are smaller brass balls 025 of an inch in diameter the forks l and r supporting them were of brass wire 02 of an inch in diameter the space between the large and small ball on the same fork was 5 inches that the two places of discharge n and o might be sufficiently removed from each others influence the fork l was connected with a projecting cylindrical conductor which could be rendered positive or negative at pleasure by an electrical machine and the fork r was attached to another conductor but thrown into an uninsulated state by connection with a discharging train 292 the two intervals or places of discharge n and o could be varied at pleasure their extent being measured by the occasional introduction of a diagonal scale it is evident that as the balls a and b connected with the same conductor are always charged at once and that discharge may take place to either of the balls connected with the discharging train the intervals of discharge n and o may be properly compared to each other as respects the influence of large and small balls when charged positively and negatively in air  1494 when the intervals n and o were each made  09 of an inch and the balls a and b inductric positively the discharge was all at n from the small ball of the conductor to the large ball of the discharging train and mostly by positive brush though once by a spark when the balls a and b were made inductric negatively the discharge was still from the same small ball at n by a constant negative brush  1495 i diminished the intervals n and o to 06 of an inch when a and b were inductric positively all the discharge was at n as a positive brush when a and b were inductric negatively still all the discharge was at n as a negative brush  1496 the facility of discharge at the positive and negative small balls therefore did not appear to be very different if a difference had existed there were always two small balls one in each state that the discharge might happen at that most favourable to the effect the only difference was that one was in the inductric and the other in the inducteous state but whichsoever happened for the time to be in that state whether positive or negative had the advantage  1497 to counteract this interfering influence i made the interval n  079 and interval o  058 of an inch then when the balls a and b were inductric positive the discharge was about equal at both intervals when on the other hand the balls a and b were inductric negative there was discharge still at both but most at n as if the small ball negative could discharge a little easier than the same ball positive  1498 the small balls and terminations used in these and similar experiments may very correctly be compared in their action to the same balls and ends when electrified in free air at a much greater distance from conductors than they were in those cases from each other in the first place the discharge even when as a spark is according to my view determined and so to speak begins at a spot on the surface of the small ball 1374 occurring when the intensity there has risen up to a certain maximum degree 1370 this determination of discharge at a particular spot first being easily traced from the spark into the brush by increasing the distance so as at last even to render the time evident which is necessary for the production of the effect 1436 1438 in the next place the large balls which i have used might be replaced by larger balls at a still greater distance and so by successive degrees may be considered as passing into the sides of the rooms these being under general circumstances the inducteous bodies whilst the small ball rendered either positive or negative is the inductric body  1499 but as has long been recognised the small ball is only a blunt end and electrically speaking a point only a small ball so that when a point or blunt end is throwing out its brushes into the air it is acting exactly as the small balls have acted in the experiments already described and by virtue of the same properties and relations  1500 it may very properly be said with respect to the experiments that the large negative ball is as essential to the discharge as the small positive ball and also that the large negative ball shows as much superiority over the large positive ball which is inefficient in causing a spark from its opposed small negative ball as the small positive ball does over the small negative ball and probably when we understand the real cause of the difference and refer it rather to the condition of the particles of the dielectric than to the sizes of the conducting balls we may find much importance in such an observation but for the present and whilst engaged in investigating the point we may admit what is the fact that the forces are of higher intensity at the surfaces of the smaller balls than at those of the larger 1372 1374 that the former therefore determine the discharge by first rising up to that exalted condition which is necessary for it and that whether brought to this condition by induction towards the walls of a room or the large balls i have used these may fairly be compared one with the other in their influence and actions  1501 the conclusions i arrive at are first that when two equal small conducting surfaces equally placed in air are electrified one positively and the other negatively that which is negative can discharge to the air at a tension a little lower than that required for the positive ball second that when discharge does take place much more passes at each time from the positive than from the negative surface 1491 the last conclusion is very abundantly proved by the optical analysis of the positive and negative brushes already described 1468 the latter set of discharges being found to recur five or six times oftener than the formera    a a very excellent mode of examining the relation of small positive   and negative surfaces would be by the use of drops of gum water   solutions or other liquids see onwards 1581 1593  1502 if now a small ball be made to give brushes or brushy sparks by a powerful machine we can in some measure understand and relate the difference perceived when it is rendered positive or negative it is known to give when positive a much larger and more powerful spark than when negative and with greater facility 1482 in fact the spark although it takes away so much more electricity at once commences at a tension higher only in a small degree if at all on the other hand if rendered negative though discharge may commence at a lower degree it continues but for a very short period very little electricity passing away each time these circumstances are directly related for the extent to which the positive spark can reach and the size and extent of the positive brush are consequences of the capability which exists of much electricity passing off at one discharge from the positive surface 1468 1501  1503 but to refer these effects only to the form and size of the conductor would according to my notion of induction be a very imperfect mode of viewing the whole question 1523 1600 i apprehend that the effects are due altogether to the mode in which the particles of the interposed dielectric polarize and i have already given some experimental indications of the differences presented by different electrics in this respect 1475 1476 the modes of polarization as i shall have occasion hereafter to show may be very diverse in different dielectrics with respect to common air what seems to be the consequence of a superiority in the positive force at the surface of the small ball may be due to the more exalted condition of the negative polarity of the particles of air or of the nitrogen in it the negative part being perhaps more compressed whilst the positive part is more diffuse or vice versa 1687 c for such a condition could determine certain effects at the positive ball which would not take place to the same degree at the negative ball just as well as if the positive ball had possessed some special and independent power of its own  1504 the opinion that the effects are more likely to be dependent upon the dielectric than the ball is supported by the character of the two discharges if a small positive ball be throwing off brushes with ramifications ten inches long how can the ball affect that part of a ramification which is five inches from it yet the portion beyond that place has the same character as that preceding it and no doubt has that character impressed by the same general principle and law looking upon the action of the contiguous particles of a dielectric as fully proved i see in such a ramification a propagation of discharge from particle to particle each doing for the one next it what was done for it by the preceding particle and what was done for the first particle by the charged metal against which it was situated  1505 with respect to the general condition and relations of the positive and negative brushes in dense or rare air or in other media and gases if they are produced at different times and places they are of course independent of each other but when they are produced from opposed ends or balls at the same time in the same vessel of gas 1470 1477 they are frequently related and circumstances may be so arranged that they shall be isochronous occurring in equal numbers in equal times or shall occur in multiples ie with two or three negatives to one positive or shall alternate or be quite irregular all these variations i have witnessed and when it is considered that the air in the vessel and also the glass of the vessel can take a momentary charge it is easy to comprehend their general nature and cause                                       1506 similar experiments to those in air 1485 1493 were made in different gases the results of which i will describe as briefly as possible the apparatus is represented fig 131 consisting of a bellglass eleven inches in diameter at the widest part and ten and a half inches high up to the bottom of the neck the balls are lettered as in fig 130 and are in the same relation to each other but a and b were on separate sliding wires which however were generally joined by a cross wire w above and that connected with the brass conductor which received its positive or negative charge from the machine the rods of a and b were graduated at the part moving through the stuffingbox so that the application of a diagonal scale applied there told what was the distance between these balls and those beneath them as to the position of the balls in the jar and their relation to each other c and d were three and a quarter inches apart their height above the pump plate five inches and the distance between any of the balls and the glass of the jar one inch and three quarters at least and generally more the balls a and d were two inches in diameter as before 1493 the balls b and c only 015 of an inch in diameter  another apparatus was occasionally used in connection with that just described being an open discharger fig 132 by which a comparison of the discharge in air and that in gases could be obtained the balls e and f each 06 of an inch in diameter were connected with sliding rods and other balls and were insulated when used for comparison the brass conductor was associated at the same time with the balls a and b of figure 131 and ball e of this apparatus fig 132 whilst the balls c d and f were connected with the discharging train  1507 i will first tabulate the results as to the restraining power of the gases over discharge the balls a and c fig 131 were thrown out of action by distance and the effects at b and d or the interval n in the gas compared with those at the interval p in the air between e and f fig 132 the table sufficiently explains itself it will be understood that all discharge was in the air when the interval there was less than that expressed in the first or third columns of figures and all the discharge in the gas when the interval in air was greater than that in the second or fourth column of figures at intermediate distances the discharge was occasionally at both places ie sometimes in the air sometimes in the gas                                                                                                interval p in parts of an inch

the last series 1388 and confirm the conclusion that different gases restrain discharge in very different proportions they are probably not so good as the former ones for the glass jar not being varnished acted irregularly sometimes taking a certain degree of charge as a nonconductor and at other times acting as a conductor in the conveyance and derangement of that charge another cause of difference in the ratios is no doubt the relative sizes of the discharge balls in air in the former case they were of very different size here they were alike  1509 in future experiments intended to have the character of accuracy the influence of these circumstances ought to be ascertained and above all things the gases themselves ought to be contained in vessels of metal and not of glass                                       1510 the next set of results are those obtained when the intervals n and o fig 131 were made equal to each other and relate to the greater facility of discharge at the small ball when rendered positive or negative 1493  1511 in air with the intervals  04 of an inch a and b being inductric and positive discharge was nearly equal at n and o when a and b were inductric and negative the discharge was mostly at n by negative brush when the intervals were  08 of an inch with a and b inductric positively all discharge was at n by positive brush with a and b inductric negatively all the discharge was at n by a negative brush it is doubtful therefore from these results whether the negative ball has any greater facility than the positive  1512 nitrogenintervals n and o  04 of an inch a b inductric positive discharge at both intervals most at n by positive sparks a b inductric negative discharge equal at n and o the intervals made  08 of an inch a b inductric positive discharge all at n by positive brush a b inductric negative discharge most at o by positive brush in this gas therefore though the difference is not decisive it would seem that the positive small ball caused the most ready discharge  1513 oxygenintervals n and o  04 of an inch a b inductric positive discharge nearly equal inductric negative discharge mostly at n by negative brush made the intervals  08 of an inch a b inductric positive discharge both at n and o inductric negative discharge all at o by negative brush so here the negative small ball seems to give the most ready discharge  1514 hydrogenintervals n and o  04 of an inch a b inductric positive discharge nearly equal inductric negative discharge mostly at o intervals  08 of an inch a and b inductric positive discharge mostly at n as positive brush inductric negative discharge mostly at o as positive brush here the positive discharge seems most facile  1515 coal gasn and o  04 of an inch a b inductric positive discharge nearly all at o by negative spark a b inductric negative discharge nearly all at n by negative spark intervals  08 of an inch and a b inductric positive discharge mostly at o by negative brush a b inductric negative discharge all at n by negative brush here the negative discharge most facile  1516 carbonic acid gasn and o  01 of an inch a b inductric positive discharge nearly all at o or negative a b inductric negative discharge nearly all at n or negative intervals  08 of an inch a b inductric positive discharge mostly at o or negative a b inductric negative discharge all at n or negative in this case the negative had a decided advantage in facility of discharge  1517 thus if we may trust this form of experiment the negative small ball has a decided advantage in facilitating disruptive discharge over the positive small ball in some gases as in carbonic acid gas and coal gas 1399 whilst in others that conclusion seems more doubtful and in others again there seems a probability that the positive small ball may be superior all these results were obtained at very nearly the same pressure of the atmosphere                                       1518 i made some experiments in these gases whilst in the air jar fig 131 as to the change from spark to brush analogous to those in the open air already described 1486 1487 i will give in a table the results as to when brush began to appear mingled with the spark but the after results were so varied and the nature of the discharge in different gases so different that to insert the results obtained without further investigation would be of little use at intervals less than those expressed the discharge was always by spark

1519 it is to be understood that sparks occurred at much higher intervals than these the table only expresses that distance beneath which all discharge was as spark some curious relations of the different gases to discharge are already discernible but it would be useless to consider them until illustrated by further experiments                                       1520 i ought not to omit noticing here that professor belli of milan has published a very valuable set of experiments on the relative dissipation of positive and negative electricity in the aira he finds the latter far more ready in this respect than the former    a bibliothèque universelle 1836 september p 152  1521 i made some experiments of a similar kind but with sustained high charges the results were less striking than those of signore belli and i did not consider them as satisfactory i may be allowed to mention in connexion with the subject an interfering effect which embarrassed me for a long time when i threw positive electricity from a given point into the air a certain intensity was indicated by an electrometer on the conductor connected with the point but as the operation continued this intensity rose several degrees then making the conductor negative with the same point attached to it and all other things remaining the same a certain degree of tension was observed in the first instance which also gradually rose as the operation proceeded returning the conductor to the positive state the tension was at first low but rose as before and so also when again made negative  1522 this result appeared to indicate that the point which had been giving off one electricity was by that more fitted for a short time to give off the other but on closer examination i found the whole depended upon the inductive reaction of that air which being charged by the point and gradually increasing in quantity before it as the positive or negative issue was continued diverted and removed a part of the inductive action of the surrounding wall and thus apparently affected the powers of the point whilst really it was the dielectric itself that was causing the change of tension                                       1523 the results connected with the different conditions of positive and negative discharge will have a far greater influence on the philosophy of electrical science than we at present imagine especially if as i believe they depend on the peculiarity and degree of polarized condition which the molecules of the dielectrics concerned acquire 1503 1600 thus for instance the relation of our atmosphere and the earth within it to the occurrence of spark or brush must be especial and not accidental 1464 it would not else consist with other meteorological phenomena also of course dependent on the special properties of the air and which being themselves in harmony the most perfect with the functions of animal and vegetable life are yet restricted in their actions not by loose regulations but by laws the most precise  1524 even in the passage through air of the voltaic current we see the peculiarities of positive and negative discharge at the two charcoal points and if these discharges are made to take place simultaneously to mercury the distinction is still more remarkable both as to the sound and the quantity of vapour produced  1525 it seems very possible that the remarkable difference recently observed and described by my friend professor daniella namely that when a zinc and a copper ball the same in size were placed respectively in copper and zinc spheres also the same in size and excited by electrolytes or dielectrics of the same strength and nature the zinc ball far surpassed the zinc sphere in action may also be connected with these phenomena for it is not difficult to conceive how the polarity of the particles shall be affected by the circumstance of the positive surface namely the zinc being the larger or the smaller of the two inclosing the electrolyte it is even possible that with different electrolytes or dielectrics the ratio may be considerably varied or in some cases even inverted    a philosophical transactions 1838 p 47                                       glow discharge  1526 that form of disruptive discharge which appears as a glow 1359 1405 is very peculiar and beautiful it seems to depend on a quick and almost continuous charging of the air close to and in contact with the conductor  1527 diminution of the charging surface will produce it thus when a rod 03 of an inch in diameter with a rounded termination was rendered positive in free air it gave fine brushes from the extremity but occasionally these disappeared and a quiet phosphorescent continuous glow took their place covering the whole of the end of the wire and extending a very small distance from the metal into the air with a rod 02 of an inch in diameter the glow was more readily produced with still smaller rods and also with blunt conical points it occurred still more readily and with a fine point i could not obtain the brush in free air but only this glow the positive glow and the positive star are in fact the same  1528 increase of power in the machine tends to produce the glow for rounded terminations which will give only brushes when the machine is in weak action will readily give the glow when it is in good order  1529 rarefaction of the air wonderfully favours the glow phenomena a brass ball two and a half inches in diameter being made positively inductric in an airpump receiver became covered with glow over an area of two inches in diameter when the pressure was reduced to 44 inches of mercury by a little adjustment the ball could be covered all over with this light using a brass ball 125 inches in diameter and making it inducteously positive by an inductric negative point the phenomena at high degrees of rarefaction were exceedingly beautiful the glow came over the positive ball and gradually increased in brightness until it was at last very luminous and it also stood up like a low flame half an inch or more in height on touching the sides of the glass jar this lambent flame was affected assumed a ring form like a crown on the top of the ball appeared flexible and revolved with a comparatively slow motion ie about four or five times in a second this ringshape and revolution are beautifully connected with the mechanical currents 1576 taking place within the receiver these glows in rarefied air are often highly exalted in beauty by a spark discharge at the conductor 1551 note  1530 to obtain a negative glow in air at common pressures is difficult i did not procure it on the rod 03 of an inch in diameter by my machine nor on much smaller rods and it is questionable as yet whether even on fine points what is called the negative star is a very reduced and minute but still intermitting brush or a glow similar to that obtained on a positive point  1531 in rarefied air the negative glow can easily be obtained if the rounded ends of two metal rods about o2 of an inch in diameter are introduced into a globe or jar the air within being rarefied and being opposite to each other are about four inches apart the glow can be obtained on both rods covering not only the ends but an inch or two of the part behind on using balls in the airpump jar and adjusting the distance and exhaustion the negative ball could be covered with glow whether it were the inductric or the inducteous surface  1532 when rods are used it is necessary to be aware that if placed concentrically in the jar or globe the light on one rod is often reflected by the sides of the vessel on to the other rod and makes it apparently luminous when really it is not so this effect may be detected by shifting the eye at the time of observation or avoided by using blackened rods  1533 it is curious to observe the relation of glow brush and spark to each other as produced by positive or negative surfaces thus beginning with spark discharge it passes into brush much sooner when the surface at which the discharge commences 1484 is negative than it does when positive but proceeding onwards in the order of change we find that the positive brush passes into glow long before the negative brush does so that though each presents the three conditions in the same general order the series are not precisely the same it is probable that when these points are minutely examined as they must be shortly we shall find that each different gas or dielectric presents its own peculiar results dependent upon the mode in which its particles assume polar electric condition  1534 the glow occurs in all gases in which i have looked for it these are air nitrogen oxygen hydrogen coal gas carbonic acid muriatic acid sulphurous acid and ammonia i thought also that i obtained it in oil of turpentine but if so it was very dull and small  1535 the glow is always accompanied by a wind proceeding either directly out from the glowing part or directly towards it the former being the most general case this takes place even when the glow occurs upon a ball of considerable size and if matters be so arranged that the ready and regular access of air to a part exhibiting the glow be interfered with or prevented the glow then disappears  1536 i have never been able to analyse or separate the glow into visible elementary intermitting discharges 1427 1433 nor to obtain the other evidence of intermitting action namely an audible sound 1431 the want of success as respects trials made by ocular means may depend upon the large size of the glow preventing the separation of the visible images and indeed if it does intermit it is not likely that all parts intermit at once with a simultaneous regularity  1537 all the effects tend to show that glow is due to a continuous charge or discharge of air in the former case being accompanied by a current from and in the latter by one to the place of the glow as the surrounding air comes up to the charged conductor on attaining that spot at which the tension of the particles is raised to the sufficient degree 1370 1410 it becomes charged and then moves off by the joint action of the forces to which it is subject and at the same time that it makes way for other particles to come and be charged in turn actually helps to form that current by which they are brought into the necessary position thus through the regularity of the forces a constant and quiet result is produced and that result is the charging of successive portions of air the production of a current and of a continuous glow  1538 i have frequently been able to make the termination of a rod which when left to itself would produce a brush produce in preference a glow simply by aiding the formation of a current of air at its extremity and on the other hand it is not at all difficult to convert the glow into brushes by affecting the current of air 1574 1579 or the inductive action near it  1539 the transition from glow on the one hand to brush and spark on the other and therefore their connexion may be established in various ways those circumstances which tend to facilitate the charge of the air by the excited conductor and also those which tend to keep the tension at the same degree notwithstanding the discharge assist in producing the glow whereas those which tend to resist the charge of the air or other dielectric and those which favour the accumulation of electric force prior to discharge which sinking by that act has to be exalted before the tension can again acquire the requisite degree favour intermitting discharge and therefore the production of brush or spark thus rarefaction of the air the removal of large conducting surfaces from the neighbourhood of the glowing termination the presentation of a sharp point towards it help to sustain or produce the glow but the condensation of the air the presentation of the hand or other large surface the gradual approximation of a discharging ball tend to convert the glow into brush or even spark all these circumstances may be traced and reduced in a manner easily comprehensible to their relative power of assisting to produce either a continuous discharge to the air which gives the glow or an interrupted one which produces the brush and in a more exalted condition the spark  1540 the rounded end of a brass rod 03 of an inch in diameter was covered with a positive glow by the working of an electrical machine on stopping the machine so that the charge of the connected conductor should fall the glow changed for a moment into brushes just before the discharge ceased altogether illustrating the necessity for a certain high continuous charge for a certain sized termination working the machine so that the intensity should be just low enough to give continual brushes from the end in free air the approach of a fine point changed these brushes into a glow working the machine so that the termination presented a continual glow in free air the gradual approach of the hand caused the glow to contract at the very end of the wire then to throw out a luminous point which becoming a foot stalk 1426 finally produced brushes with large ramifications all these results are in accordance with what is stated above 1539  1541 greasing the end of a rounded wire will immediately make it produce brushes instead of glow a ball having a blunt point which can be made to project more or less beyond its surface at pleasure can be made to produce every gradation from glow through brush to spark  1542 it is also very interesting and instructive to trace the transition from spark to glow through the intermediate condition of stream between ends in a vessel containing air more or less rarefied but i fear to be prolix  1543 all the effects show that the glow is in its nature exactly the same as the luminous part of a brush or ramification namely a charging of air the only difference being that the glow has a continuous appearance from the constant renewal of the same action in the same place whereas the ramification is due to a momentary independent and intermitting action of the same kind                                       dark discharge  1544 i will now notice a very remarkable circumstance in the luminous discharge accompanied by negative glow which may perhaps be correctly traced hereafter into discharges of much higher intensity two brass rods 03 of an inch in diameter entering a glass globe on opposite sides had their ends brought into contact and the air about them very much rarefied a discharge of electricity from the machine was then made through them and whilst that was continued the ends were separated from each other at the moment of separation a continuous glow came over the end of the negative rod the positive termination remaining quite dark as the distance was increased a purple stream or haze appeared on the end of the positive rod and proceeded directly outwards towards the negative rod elongating as the interval was enlarged but never joining the negative glow there being always a short dark space between this space of about 116th or 120th of an inch was apparently invariable in its extent and its position relative to the negative rod nor did the negative glow vary whether the negative end were inductric or inducteous the same effect was produced it was strange to see the positive purple haze diminish or lengthen as the ends were separated and yet this dark space and the negative glow remain unaltered fig 133  1545 two balls were then used in a large airpump receiver and the air rarefied the usual transitions in the character of the discharge took place but whenever the luminous stream which appears after the spark and the brush have ceased was itself changed into glow at the balls the dark space occurred and that whether the one or the other ball was made inductric or positive or negative  1546 sometimes when the negative ball was large the machine in powerful action and the rarefaction high the ball would be covered over half its surface with glow and then upon a hasty observation would seem to exhibit no dark space but this was a deception arising from the overlapping of the convex termination of the negative glow and the concave termination of the positive stream more careful observation and experiment have convinced me that when the negative glow occurs it never visibly touches the luminous part of the positive discharge but that the dark space is always there  1547 this singular separation of the positive and negative discharge as far as concerns their luminous character under circumstances which one would have thought very favourable to their coalescence is probably connected with their differences when in the form of brush and is perhaps even dependent on the same cause further there is every likelihood that the dark parts which occur in feeble sparks are also connected with these phenomenaa to understand them would be very important for it is quite clear that in many of the experiments indeed in all that i have quoted discharge is taking place across the dark part of the dielectric to an extent quite equal to what occurs in the luminous part this difference in the result would seem to imply a distinction in the modes by which the two electric forces are brought into equilibrium in the respective parts and looking upon all the phenomena as giving additional proofs that it is to the condition of the particles of the dielectric we must refer for the principles of induction and discharge so it would be of great importance if we could know accurately in what the difference of action in the dark and the luminous parts consisted    a see professor johnsons experiments sillimans journal xxv p 57  1548 the dark discharge through air 1552 which in the case mentioned is very evident 1544 leads to the inquiry whether the particles of air are generally capable of effecting discharge from one to another without becoming luminous and the inquiry is important because it is connected with that degree of tension which is necessary to originate discharge 1368 1370 discharge between air and conductors without luminous appearances are very common and nonluminous discharges by carrying currents of air and other fluids 1562 1595 are also common enough but these are not cases in point for they are not discharges between insulating particles  1549 an arrangement was made for discharge between two balls 1485 fig 129 but in place of connecting the inducteous ball directly with the discharging train it was put in communication with the inside coating of a leyden jar and the discharging train with the outside coating then working the machine it was found that whenever sonorous and luminous discharge occurred at the balls a b the jar became charged but that when these did not occur the jar acquired no charge and such was the case when small rounded terminations were used in place of the balls and also in whatever manner they were arranged under these circumstances therefore discharge even between the air and conductors was always luminous  1550 but in other cases the phenomena are such as to make it almost certain that dark discharge can take place across air if the rounded end of a metal rod 015 of an inch in diameter be made to give a good negative brush the approach of a smaller end or a blunt point opposite to it will at a certain distance cause a diminution of the brush and a glow will appear on the positive inducteous wire accompanied by a current of air passing from it now as the air is being charged both at the positive and negative surfaces it seems a reasonable conclusion that the charged portions meet somewhere in the interval and there discharge to each other without producing any luminous phenomena it is possible however that the air electrified positively at the glowing end may travel on towards the negative surface and actually form that atmosphere into which the visible negative brushes dart in which case dark discharge need not of necessity occur but i incline to the former opinion and think that the diminution in size of the negative brush as the positive glow comes on to the end of the opposed wire is in favour of that view  1551 using rarefied air as the dielectric it is very easy to obtain luminous phenomena as brushes or glow upon both conducting balls or terminations whilst the interval is dark and that when the action is so momentary that i think we cannot consider currents as effecting discharge across the dark part thus if two balls about an inch in diameter and 4 or more inches apart have the air rarefied about them and are then interposed in the course of discharge an interrupted or spark current being produced at the machinea each termination may be made to show luminous phenomena whilst more or less of the interval is quite dark the discharge will pass as suddenly as a retarded spark 295 334 ie in an interval of time almost inappreciably small and in such a case i think it must have passed across the dark part as true disruptive discharge and not by convection    a by spark current i mean one passing in a series of spark between   the conductor of the machine and the apparatus by a continuous   current one that passes through metallic conductors and in that   respect without interruption at the same place  1552 hence i conclude that dark disruptive discharge may occur 1547 1550 and also that in the luminous brush the visible ramifications may not show the full extent of the disruptive discharge 1444 1452 but that each may have a dark outside enveloping as it were every part through which the discharge extends it is probable even that there are such things as dark discharges analogous in form to the brush and the spark but not luminous in any part 1445  1553 the occurrence of dark discharge in any case shows at how low a tension disruptive discharge may occur 1548 and indicates that the light of the ultimate brush or spark is in no relation to the intensity required 1368 1370 so to speak the discharge begins in darkness and the light is a mere consequence of the quantity which after discharge has commenced flows to that spot and there finds its most facile passage 1418 1435 as an illustration of the growth generally of discharge i may remark that in the experiments on the transition in oxygen of the discharge from spark to brush 1518 every spark was immediately preceded by a short brush  1554 the phenomena relative to dark discharge in other gases though differing in certain characters from those in air confirm the conclusions drawn above the two rounded terminations 1544 fig 133 were placed in muriatic acid gas 1445 1463 at the pressure of 65 inches of mercury and a continuous machine current of electricity sent through the apparatus bright sparks occurred until the interval was about or above an inch when they were replaced by squat brushy intermitting glows upon both terminations with a dark part between when the current at the machine was in spark then each spark caused a discharge across the muriatic acid gas which with a certain interval was bright with a larger interval was straight across and flamy like a very exhausted and sudden but not a dense sharp spark and with a still larger interval produced a feeble brush on the inductric positive end and a glow on the inducteous negative end the dark part being between 1544 and at such times the spark at the conductor instead of being sudden and sonorous was dull and quiet 334  1555 on introducing more muriatic acid gas until the pressure was 2997 inches the same terminations gave bright sparks within at small distances but when they were about an inch or more apart the discharge was generally with very small brushes and glow and frequently with no light at all though electricity had passed through the gas whenever the bright spark did pass through the muriatic acid gas at this pressure it was bright throughout presenting no dark or dull space  1556 in coal gas at common pressures when the distance was about an inch the discharge was accompanied by short brushes on the ends and a dark interval of half an inch or more between them notwithstanding the discharge had the sharp quick sound of a dull spark and could not have depended in the dark part on convection 1562  1557 this gas presents several curious points in relation to the bright and dark parts of spark discharge when bright sparks passed between the rod ends 03 of an inch in diameter 1544 very sudden dark parts would occur next to the brightest portions of the spark again with these ends and also with balls 1422 the bright sparks would be sometimes red sometimes green and occasionally green and red in different parts of the same spark again in the experiments described 1518 at certain intervals a very peculiar pale dull yet sudden discharge would pass which though apparently weak was very direct in its course and accompanied by a sharp snapping noise as if quick in its occurrence  1558 hydrogen frequently gave peculiar sparks one part being bright red whilst the other was a dull pale gray or else the whole spark was dull and peculiar  1559 nitrogen presents a very remarkable discharge between two balls of the respective diameters of 015 and 2 inches 1506 1518 the smaller one being rendered negative either directly inducteously the peculiar discharge occurs at intervals between 042 and 068 and even at 14 inches when the large ball was inductric positively it consisted of a little brushy part on the small negative ball then a dark space and lastly a dull straight line on the large positive ball fig 134 the position of the dark space was very constant and is probably in direct relation to the dark space described when negative glow was produced 1544 when by any circumstance a bright spark was determined the contrast with the peculiar spark described was very striking for it always had a faint purple part but the place of this part was constantly near the positive ball  1560 thus dark discharge appears to be decidedly established but its establishment is accompanied by proofs that it occurs in different degrees and modes in different gases hence then another specific action added to the many 1296 1398 1399 1423 1454 1503 by which the electrical relations of insulating dielectrics are distinguished and established and another argument in favour of that molecular theory of induction which is at present under examinationa    a i cannot resist referring here by a note to biots philosophical   view of the nature of the light of the electric discharge annales de   chimie liii p 321                                       1561 what i have had to say regarding disruptive discharge has extended to some length but i hope will be excused in consequence of the importance of the subject before concluding my remarks i will again intimate in the form of a query whether we have not reason to consider the tension or retention and after discharge in air or other insulating dielectrics as the same thing with retardation and discharge in a metal wire differing only but almost infinitely in degree 1334 1336 in other words can we not by a gradual chain of association carry up discharge from its occurrence in air through spermaceti and water to solutions and then on to chlorides oxides and metals without any essential change in its character and at the same time connecting the insensible conduction of air through muriatic acid gas and the dark discharge with the better conduction of spermaceti water and the all but perfect conduction of the metals associate the phenomena at both extremes and may it not be that the retardation and ignition of a wire are effects exactly correspondent in their nature to the retention of charge and spark in air if so here again the two extremes in property amongst dielectrics will be found to be in intimate relation the whole difference probably depending upon the mode and degree in which their particles polarize under the influence of inductive actions 1338 1603 1610                                       ¶ x convection or carrying discharge  1562 the last kind of discharge which i have to consider is that effected by the motion of charged particles from place to place it is apparently very different in its nature to any of the former modes of discharge 1319 but as the result is the same may be of great importance in illustrating not merely the nature of discharge itself but also of what we call the electric current it often as before observed in cases of brush and glow 1440 1535 joins its effect to that of disruptive discharge to complete the act of neutralization amongst the electric forces  1563 the particles which being charged then travel may be either of insulating or conducting matter large or small the consideration in the first place of a large particle of conducting matter may perhaps help our conceptions  1564 a copper boiler 3 feet in diameter was insulated and electrified but so feebly that dissipation by brushes or disruptive discharge did not occur at its edges or projecting parts in a sensible degree a brass ball 2 inches in diameter suspended by a clean white silk thread was brought towards it and it was found that if the ball was held for a second or two near any part of the charged surface of the boiler at such distance two inches more or less as not to receive any direct charge from it it became itself charged although insulated the whole time and its electricity was the reverse of that of the boiler  1565 this effect was the strongest opposite the edges and projecting parts of the boiler and weaker opposite the sides or those extended portions of the surface which according to coulombs results have the weakest charge it was very strong opposite a rod projecting a little way from the boiler it occurred when the copper was charged negatively as well as positively it was produced also with small balls down to 02 of an inch and less in diameter and also with smaller charged conductors than the copper it is indeed hardly possible in some cases to carry an insulated ball within an inch or two of a charged plane or convex surface without its receiving a charge of the contrary kind to that of the surface  1566 this effect is one of induction between the bodies not of communication the ball when related to the positive charged surface by the intervening dielectric has its opposite sides brought into contrary states that side towards the boiler being negative and the outer side positive more inductric action is directed towards it than would have passed across the same place if the ball had not been there for several reasons amongst others because being a conductor the resistance of the particles of the dielectric which otherwise would have been there is removed 1298 and also because the reacting positive surface of the ball being projected further out from the boiler than when there is no introduction of conducting matter is more free therefore to act through the rest of the dielectric towards surrounding conductors and so favours the exaltation of that inductric polarity which is directed in its course it is as to the exaltation of force upon its outer surface beyond that upon the inductric surface of the boiler as if the latter were itself protuberant in that direction thus it acquires a state like but higher than that of the surface of the boiler which causes it and sufficiently exalted to discharge at its positive surface to the air or to affect small particles as it is itself affected by the boiler and they flying to it take a charge and pass off and so the ball as a whole is brought into the contrary inducteous state the consequence is that if free to move its tendency under the influence of all the forces to approach the boiler is increased whilst it at the same time becomes more and more exalted in its condition both of polarity and charge until at a certain distance discharge takes place it acquires the same state as the boiler is repelled and passing to that conductor most favourably circumstanced to discharge it there resumes its first indifferent condition  1567 it seems to me that the manner in which inductric bodies affect uncharged floating or moveable conductors near them is very frequently of this nature and generally so when it ends in a carrying operation 1562 1602 the manner in which whilst the dominant inductric body cannot give off its electricity to the air the inducteous body can effect the discharge of the same kind of force is curious and in the case of elongated or irregularly shaped conductors such as filaments or particles of dust the effect will often be very ready and the consequent attraction immediate  1568 the effect described is also probably influential in causing those variations in spark discharge referred to in the last series 1386 1390 1391 for if a particle of dust were drawn towards the axis of induction between the balls it would tend whilst at some distance from that axis to commence discharge at itself in the manner described 1566 and that commencement might so far facilitate the act 1417 1420 as to make the complete discharge as spark pass through the particle though it might not be the shortest course from ball to ball so also with equal balls at equal distances as in the experiments of comparison already described 1493 1506 a particle being between one pair of balls would cause discharge there in preference or even if a particle were between each difference of size or shape would give one for the time a predominance over the other  1569 the power of particles of dust to carry off electricity in cases of high tension is well known and i have already mentioned some instances of the kind in the use of the inductive apparatus 1201 the general operation is very well shown by large light objects as the toy called the electrical spider or if smaller ones are wanted for philosophical investigation by the smoke of a glowing green wax taper which presenting a successive stream of such particles makes their course visible  1570 on using oil of turpentine as the dielectric the action and course of small conducting carrying particles in it can be well observed a few short pieces of thread will supply the place of carriers and their progressive action is exceedingly interesting  1571 a very striking effect was produced on oil of turpentine which whether it was due to the carrying power of the particles in it or to any other action of them is perhaps as yet doubtful a portion of that fluid in a glass vessel had a large uninsulated silver dish at the bottom and an electrified metal rod with a round termination dipping into it at the top the insulation was very good and the attraction and other phenomena striking the rod end with a drop of gum water attached to it was then electrified in the fluid the gum water soon spun off in fine threads and was quickly dissipated through the oil of turpentine by the time that four drops had in this way been commingled with a pint of the dielectric the latter had lost by far the greatest portion of its insulating power no sparks could be obtained in the fluid and all the phenomena dependent upon insulation had sunk to a low degree the fluid was very slightly turbid upon being filtered through paper only it resumed its first clearness and now insulated as well as before the water therefore was merely diffused through the oil of turpentine not combined with or dissolved in it but whether the minute particles acted as carriers or whether they were not rather gathered together in the line of highest inductive tension 1350 and there being drawn into elongated forms by the electric forces combined their effects to produce a band of matter having considerable conducting power as compared with the oil of turpentine is as yet questionable  1572 the analogy between the action of solid conducting carrying particles and that of the charged particles of fluid insulating substances acting as dielectrics is very evident and simple but in the latter case the result is necessarily currents in the mobile media particles are brought by inductric action into a polar state and the latter after rising to a certain tension 1370 is followed by the communication of a part of the force originally on the conductor the particles consequently become charged and then under the joint influence of the repellent and attractive forces are urged towards a discharging place or to that spot where these inductric forces are most easily compensated by the contrary inducteous forces  1573 why a point should be so exceedingly favourable to the production of currents in a fluid insulating dielectric as air is very evident it is at the extremity of the point that the intensity necessary to charge the air is first acquired 1374 it is from thence that the charged particle recedes and the mechanical force which it impresses on the air to form a current is in every way favoured by the shape and position of the rod of which the point forms the termination at the same time the point having become the origin of an active mechanical force does by the very act of causing that force namely by discharge prevent any other part of the rod from acquiring the same necessary condition and so preserves and sustains its own predominance  1574 the very varied and beautiful phenomena produced by sheltering or enclosing the point illustrate the production of the current exceedingly well and justify the same conclusions it being remembered that in such cases the effect upon the discharge is of two kinds for the current may be interfered with by stopping the access of fresh uncharged air or retarding the removal of that which has been charged as when a point is electrified in a tube of insulating matter closed at one extremity or the electric condition of the point itself may be altered by the relation of other parts in its neighbourhood also rendered electric as when the point is in a metal tube by the metal itself or when it is in the glass tube by a similar action of the charged parts of the glass or even by the surrounding air which has been charged and which cannot escape  1575 whenever it is intended to observe such inductive phenomena in a fluid dielectric as have a direct relation to and dependence upon the fluidity of the medium such for instance as discharge from points or attractions and repulsions c then the mass of the fluid should be great and in such proportion to the distance between the inductric and inducteous surfaces as to include all the lines of inductive force 1369 between them otherwise the effects of currents attraction c which are the resultants of all these forces cannot be obtained the phenomena which occur in the open air or in the middle of a globe filled with oil of turpentine will not take place in the same media if confined in tubes of glass shelllac sulphur or other such substances though they be excellent insulating dielectrics nor can they be expected for in such cases the polar forces instead of being all dispersed amongst fluid particles which tend to move under their influence are now associated in many parts with particles that notwithstanding their tendency to motion are constrained by their solidity to remain quiescent  1576 the varied circumstances under which with conductors differently formed and constituted currents can occur all illustrate the same simplicity of production a ball if the intensity be raised sufficiently on its surface and that intensity be greatest on a part consistent with the production of a current of air up to and off from it will produce the effect like a point 1537 such is the case whenever the glow occurs upon a ball the current being essential to that phenomenon if as large a sphere as can well be employed with the production of glow be used the glow will appear at the place where the current leaves the ball and that will be the part directly opposite to the connection of the ball and rod which supports it but by increasing the tension elsewhere so as to raise it above the tension upon that spot which can easily be effected inductively then the place of the glow and the direction of the current will also change and pass to that spot which for the time is most favourable for their production 1591  1577 for instance approaching the hand towards the ball will tend to cause brush 1539 but by increasing the supply of electricity the condition of glow may be preserved then on moving the hand about from side to side the position of the glow will very evidently move with it  1578 a point brought towards a glowing ball would at twelve or fourteen inches distance make the glow break into brush but when still nearer glow was reproduced probably dependent upon the discharge of wind or air passing from the point to the ball and this glow was very obedient to the motion of the point following it in every direction  1579 even a current of wind could affect the place of the glow for a varnished glass tube being directed sideways towards the ball air was sometimes blown through it at the ball and sometimes not in the former case the place of the glow was changed a little as if it were blown away by the current and this is just the result which might have been anticipated all these effects illustrate beautifully the general causes and relations both of the glow and the current of air accompanying it 1574  1580 flame facilitates the production of a current in the dielectric surrounding it thus if a ball which would not occasion a current in the air have a flame whether large or small formed on its surface the current is produced with the greatest ease but not the least difficulty can occur in comprehending the effective action of the flame in this case if its relation as part of the surrounding dielectric to the electrified ball be but for a moment considered 1375 1380  1581 conducting fluid terminations instead of rigid points illustrate in a very beautiful manner the formation of the currents with their effects and influence in exalting the conditions under which they were commenced let the rounded end of a brass rod 03 of an inch or thereabouts in diameter point downwards in free air let it be amalgamated and have a drop of mercury suspended from it and then let it be powerfully electrized the mercury will present the phenomenon of glow a current of air will rush along the rod and set off from the mercury directly downwards and the form of the metallic drop will be slightly affected the convexity at a small part near the middle and lower part becoming greater whilst it diminishes all round at places a little removed from this spot the change is from the form of a fig 135 to that of b and is due almost if not entirely to the mechanical force of the current of air sweeping over its surface  1582 as a comparative observation let it be noticed that a ball gradually brought towards it converts the glow into brushes and ultimately sparks pass from the most projecting part of the mercury a point does the same but at much smaller distances  1583 take next a drop of strong solution of muriate of lime being electrified a part will probably be dissipated but a considerable portion if the electricity be not too powerful will remain forming a conical drop fig 136 accompanied by a strong current if glow be produced the drop will be smooth on the surface if a short low brush is formed a minute tremulous motion of the liquid will be visible but both effects coincide with the principal one to be observed namely the regular and successive charge of air the formation of a wind or current and the form given by that current to the fluid drop if a discharge ball be gradually brought toward the cone sparks will at last pass and these will be from the apex of the cone to the approached ball indicating a considerable degree of conducting power in this fluid  1584 with a drop of water the effects were of the same kind and were best obtained when a portion of gum water or of syrup hung from a ball fig 137 when the machine was worked slowly a fine large quiet conical drop with concave lateral outline and a small rounded end was produced on which the glow appeared whilst a steady wind issued in a direction from the point of the cone of sufficient force to depress the surface of uninsulated water held opposite to the termination when the machine was worked more rapidly some of the water was driven off the smaller pointed portion left was roughish on the surface and the sound of successive brush discharges was heard with still more electricity more water was dispersed that which remained was elongated and contracted with an alternating motion a stronger brush discharge was heard and the vibrations of the water and the successive discharges of the individual brushes were simultaneous when water from beneath was brought towards the drop it did not indicate the same regular strong contracted current of air as before and when the distance was such that sparks passed the water beneath was attracted rather than driven away and the current of air ceased  1585 when the discharging ball was brought near the drop in its first quiet glowing state 1582 it converted that glow into brushes and caused the vibrating motion of the drop when still nearer sparks passed but they were always from the metal of the rod over the surface of the water to the point and then across the air to the ball this is a natural consequence of the deficient conducting power of the fluid 1584 1585  1586 why the drop vibrated changing its form between the periods of discharging brushes so as to be more or less acute at particular instants to be most acute when the brush issued forth and to be isochronous in its action and how the quiet glowing liquid drop on assuming the conical form facilitated as it were the first action are points as to theory so evident that i will not stop to speak of them the principal thing to observe at present is the formation of the carrying current of air and the manner in which it exhibits its existence and influence by giving form to the drop  1587 that the drop when of water or a better conductor than water is formed into a cone principally by the current of air is shown amongst other ways 1594 thus a sharp point being held opposite the conical drop the latter soon lost its pointed form was retraced and became round the current of air from it ceased and was replaced by one from the point beneath which if the latter were held near enough to the drop actually blew it aside and rendered it concave in form  1588 it is hardly necessary to say what happened with still worse conductors than water as oil or oil of turpentine the fluid itself was then spun out into threads and carried off not only because the air rushing over its surface helped to sweep it away but also because its insulating particles assumed the same charged state as the particles of air and not being able to discharge to them in a much greater decree than the air particles themselves could do were carried off by the same causes which urged those in their course a similar effect with melted sealingwax on a metal point forms an old and wellknown experiment  1589 a drop of gum water in the exhausted receiver of the airpump was not sensibly affected in its form when electrified when air was let in it begun to show change of shape when the pressure was ten inches of mercury at the pressure of fourteen or fifteen inches the change was more sensible and as the air increased in density the effects increased until they were the same as those in the open atmosphere the diminished effect in the rare air i refer to the relative diminished energy of its current that diminution depending in the first place on the lower electric condition of the electrified ball in the rarefied medium and in the next on the attenuated condition of the dielectric the cohesive force of water in relation to rarefied air being something like that of mercury to dense air 1581 whilst that of water in dense air may be compared to that of mercury in oil of turpentine 1597  1590 when a ball is covered with a thick conducting fluid as treacle or syrup it is easy by inductive action to determine the wind from almost any part of it 1577 the experiment which before was of rather difficult performance being rendered facile in consequence of the fluid enabling that part which at first was feeble in its action to rise into an exalted condition by assuming a pointed form  1591 to produce the current the electric intensity must rise and continue at one spot namely at the origin of the current higher than elsewhere and then air having a uniform and ready access the current is produced if no current be allowed 1574 then discharge may take place by brush or spark but whether it be by brush or spark or wind it seems very probable that the initial intensity or tension at which a particle of a given gaseous dielectric charges or commences discharge is under the conditions before expressed always the same 1410  1592 it is not supposed that all the air which enters into motion is electrified on the contrary much that is not charged is carried on into the stream the part which is really charged may be but a small proportion of that which is ultimately set in motion 1442   1593 when a drop of gum water 1584 is made negative it presents a larger cone than when made positive less of the fluid is thrown off and yet when a ball is approached sparks can hardly be obtained so pointed is the cone and so free the discharge a point held opposite to it did not cause the retraction of the cone to such an extent as when it was positive all the effects are so different from those presented by the positive cone that i have no doubt such drops would present a very instructive method of investigating the difference of positive and negative discharge in air and other dielectrics 1480 1501  1594 that i may not be misunderstood 1587 i must observe here that i do not consider the cones produced as the result only of the current of air or other insulating dielectric over their surface when the drop is of badly conducting matter a part of the effect is due to the electrified state of the particles and this part constitutes almost the whole when the matter is melted sealingwax oil of turpentine and similar insulating bodies 1588 but even when the drop is of good conducting matter as water solutions or mercury though the effect above spoken of will then be insensible 1607 still it is not the mere current of air or other dielectric which produces all the change of form for a part is due to those attractive forces by which the charged drop if free to move would travel along the line of strongest induction and not being free to move has its form elongated until the sum of the different forces tending to produce this form is balanced by the cohesive attraction of the fluid the effect of the attractive forces are well shown when treacle gum water or syrup is used for the long threads which spin out at the same time that they form the axes of the currents of air which may still be considered as determined at their points are like flexible conductors and show by their directions in what way the attractive forces draw them  1595 when the phenomena of currents are observed in dense insulating dielectrics they present us with extraordinary degrees of mechanical force thus if a pint of wellrectified and filtered 1571 oil of turpentine be put into a glass vessel and two wires be dipped into it in different places one leading to the electrical machine and the other to the discharging train on working the machine the fluid will be thrown into violent motion throughout its whole mass whilst at the same time it will rise two three or four inches up the machine wire and dart off jets from it into the air  1596 if very clean uninsulated mercury be at the bottom of the fluid and the wire from the machine be terminated either by a ball or a point and also pass through a glass tube extending both above and below the surface of the oil of turpentine the currents can be better observed and will be seen to rush down the wire proceeding directly from it towards the mercury and there diverging in all directions will ripple its surface strongly and mounting up at the sides of the vessel will return to reenter upon their course  1597 a drop of mercury being suspended from an amalgamated brass ball preserved its form almost unchanged in air 1581 but when immersed in the oil of turpentine it became very pointed and even particles of the metal could be spun out and carried off by the currents of the dielectric the form of the liquid metal was just like that of the syrup in air 1584 the point of the cone being quite as fine though not so long by bringing a sharp uninsulated point towards it it could also be effected in the same manner as the syrup drop in air 1587 though not so readily because of the density and limited quantity of the dielectric  1598 if the mercury at the bottom of the fluid be connected with the electrical machine whilst a rod is held in the hand terminating in a ball three quarters of an inch less or more in diameter and the ball be dipped into the electrified fluid very striking appearances ensue when the ball is raised again so as to be at a level nearly out of the fluid large portions of the latter will seem to cling to it fig 138 if it be raised higher a column of the oil of turpentine will still connect it with that in the basin below fig 139 if the machine be excited into more powerful action this will become more bulky and may then also be raised higher assuming the form fig 140 and all the time that these effects continue currents and countercurrents sometimes running very close together may be observed in the raised column of fluid  1599 it is very difficult to decide by sight the direction of the currents in such experiments as these if particles of silk are introduced they cling about the conductors but using drops of water and mercury the course of the fluid dielectric seems well indicated thus if a drop of water be placed at the end of a rod 1571 over the uninsulated mercury it is soon swept away in particles streaming downwards towards the mercury if another drop be placed on the mercury beneath the end of the rod it is quickly dispersed in all directions in the form of streaming particles the attractive forces drawing it into elongated portions and the currents carrying them away if a drop of mercury be hung from a ball used to raise a column of the fluid 1598 then the shape of the drop seems to show currents travelling in the fluid in the direction indicated by the arrows fig 141  1600 a very remarkable effect is produced on these phenomena connected with positive and negative charge and discharge namely that a ball charged positively raises a much higher and larger column of the oil of turpentine than when charged negatively there can be no doubt that this is connected with the difference of positive and negative action already spoken of 1480 1525 and tends much to strengthen the idea that such difference is referable to the particles of the dielectric rather than to the charged conductors and is dependent upon the mode in which these particles polarize 1503 1523  1601 whenever currents travel in insulating dielectrics they really effect discharge and it is important to observe though a very natural result that it is indifferent which way the current or particles travel as with reversed direction their state is reversed the change is easily made either in air or oil of turpentine between two opposed rods for an insulated ball being placed in connexion with either rod and brought near its extremity will cause the current to set towards it from the opposite end  1602 the two currents often occur at once as when both terminations present brushes and frequently when they exhibit the glow 1531 in such cases the charged particles or many of them meet and mutually discharge each other 1518 1612 if a smoking wax taper be held at the end of an insulating rod towards a charged prime conductor it will very often happen that two currents will form and be rendered visible by its vapour one passing as a fine filament of smoky particles directly to the charged conductor and the other passing as directly from the same taper wick outwards and from the conductor the principles of inductric action and charge which were referred to in considering the relation of a carrier ball and a conductor 1566 being here also called into play                                       1603 the general analogy and i think i may say identity of action found to exist as to insulation and conduction 1338 1561 when bodies the best and the worst in the classes of insulators or conductors were compared led me to believe that the phenomena of convection in badly conducting media were not without their parallel amongst the best conductors such even as the metals upon consideration the cones produced by davya in fluid metals as mercury and tin seemed to be cases in point and probably also the elongation of the metallic medium through which a current of electricity was passing described by ampère 1113b for it is not difficult to conceive that the diminution of convective effect consequent upon the high conducting power of the metallic media used in these experiments might be fully compensated for by the enormous quantity of electricity passing in fact it is impossible not to expect some effect whether sensible or not of the kind in question when such a current is passing through a fluid offering a sensible resistance to the passage of the electricity and thereby giving proof of a certain degree of insulating power 1328    a philosophical transactions 1823 p 155    b bibliothèque universelle xxi 417  1604 i endeavoured to connect the convective currents in air oil of turpentine c and those in metals by intermediate cases but found this not easy to do on taking bodies for instance which like water adds solutions fused salts or chlorides c have intermediate conducting powers the minute quantity of electricity which the common machine can supply 371 861 is exhausted instantly so that the cause of the phenomenon is kept either very low in intensity or the instant of time during which the effect lasts is so small that one cannot hope to observe the result sought for if a voltaic battery be used these bodies are all electrolytes and the evolution of gas or the production of other changes interferes and prevents observation of the effect required  1605 there are nevertheless some experiments which illustrate the connection two platina wires forming the electrodes of a powerful voltaic battery were placed side by side near each other in distilled water hermetically sealed up in a strong glass tube some minute vegetable fibres being present in the water when from the evolution of gas and the consequent increased pressure the bubbles formed on the electrodes were so small as to produce but feebly ascending currents then it could be observed that the filaments present were attracted and repelled between the two wires as they would have been between two oppositely charged surfaces in air or oil of turpentine moving so quickly as to displace and disturb the bubbles and the currents which these tended to form now i think it cannot be doubted that under similar circumstances and with an abundant supply of electricity of sufficient tension also convective currents might have been formed the attractions and repulsions of the filaments were in fact the elements of such currents 1572 and therefore water though almost infinitely above air or oil of turpentine as a conductor is a medium in which similar currents can take place  1606 i had an apparatus made fig 142 in which a is a plate of shelllac b a fine platina wire passing through it and having only the section of the wire exposed above c a ring of bibulous paper resting on the shelllac and d distilled water retained by the paper in its place and just sufficient in quantity to cover the end of the wire b another wire e touched a piece of tinfoil lying in the water and was also connected with a discharging train in this way it was easy by rendering b either positive or negative to send a current of electricity by its extremity into the fluid and so away by the wire e  1607 on connecting b with the conductor of a powerful electrical machine not the least disturbance of the level of the fluid over the end of the wire during the working of the machine could be observed but at the same time there was not the smallest indication of electrical charge about the conductor of the machine so complete was the discharge i conclude that the quantity of electricity passed in a given time had been too small when compared with the conducting power of the fluid to produce the desired effect  1608 i then charged a large leyden battery 291 and discharged it through the wire b interposing however a wet thread two feet long to prevent a spark in the water and to reduce what would else have been a sudden violent discharge into one of more moderate character enduring for a sensible length of time 334 i now did obtain a very brief elevation of the water over the end of the wire and though a few minute bubbles of gas were at the same time formed there so as to prevent me from asserting that the effect was unequivocally the same as that obtained by davy in the metals yet according to my best judgement it was partly and i believe principally of that nature  1609 i employed a voltaic battery of 100 pair of fourinch plates for experiments of a similar nature with electrolytes in these cases the shelllac was cupped and the wire b 02 of an inch in diameter sometimes i used a positive amalgamated zinc wire in contact with dilute sulphuric acid at others a negative copper wire in a solution of sulphate of copper but because of the evolution of gas the precipitation of copper c i was not able to obtain decided results it is but right to mention that when i made use of mercury endeavouring to repeat davys experiment the battery of 100 pair was not sufficient to produce the elevationsa    a in the experiments at the royal institution sir h davy used i   think 500 or 600 pairs of plates those at the london institution   were made with the apparatus of mr pepys consisting of an enormous   single pair of plates described in the philosophical transactions   for 1832 p 187  1610 the latter experiments 1609 may therefore be considered as failing to give the hopedfor proof but i have much confidence in the former 1605 1608 and in the considerations 1603 connected with them if i have rightly viewed them and we may be allowed to compare the currents at points and surfaces in such extremely different bodies as air and the metals and admit that they are effects of the same kind differing only in degree and in proportion to the insulating or conducting power of the dielectric used what great additional argument we obtain in favour of that theory which in the phenomena of insulation and conduction also as in these would link the same apparently dissimilar substances together 1336 1561 and how completely the general view which refers all the phenomena to the direct action of the molecules of matter seems to embrace the various isolated phenomena as they successively come under consideration                                       1611 the connection of this convective or carrying effect which depends upon a certain degree of insulation with conduction ie the occurrence of both in so many of the substances referred to as for instance the metals water air c would lead to many very curious theoretical generalizations which i must not indulge in here one point however i shall venture to refer to conduction appears to be essentially an action of contiguous particles and the considerations just stated together with others formerly expressed 1326 1336 c lead to the conclusion that all bodies conduct and by the same process air as well as metals the only difference being in the necessary degree of force or tension between the particles which must exist before the act of conduction or transfer from one particle to another can take place  1612 the question then arises what is this limiting condition which separates as it were conduction and insulation from each other does it consist in a difference between the two contiguous particles or the contiguous poles of these particles in the nature and amount of positive and negative force no communication or discharge occurring unless that difference rises up to a certain degree variable for different bodies but always the same for the same body or is it true that however small the difference between two such particles if time be allowed equalization of force will take place even with the particles of such bodies as air sulphur or lac in the first case insulating power in any particular body would be proportionate to the degree of the assumed necessary difference of force in the second to the time required to equalize equal degrees of difference in different bodies with regard to airs one is almost led to expect a permanent difference of force but in all other bodies time seems to be quite sufficient to ensure ultimately complete conduction the difference in the modes by which insulation may be sustained or conduction effected is not a mere fanciful point but one of great importance as being essentially connected with the molecular theory of induction and the manner in which the particles of bodies assume and retain their polarized state                                       ¶ xi relation of a vacuum to electrical phenomena  1613 it would seem strange if a theory which refers all the phenomena of insulation and conduction ie all electrical phenomena to the action of contiguous particles were to omit to notice the assumed possible case of a vacuum admitting that a vacuum can be produced it would be a very curious matter indeed to know what its relation to electrical phenomena would be and as shelllac and metal are directly opposed to each other whether a vacuum would be opposed to them both and allow neither of induction or conduction across it mr morgana has said that a vacuum does not conduct sir h davy concluded from his investigations that as perfect a vacuum as could be madeb did conduct but does not consider the prepared spaces which he used as absolute vacua in such experiments i think i have observed the luminous discharge to be principally on the inner surface of the glass and it does not appear at all unlikely that if the vacuum refused to conduct still the surface of glass next it might carry on that action    a philosophical transactions 1785 p 272    b ibid 1822 p 64  1614 at one time when i thought inductive force was exerted in right lines i hoped to illustrate this important question by making experiments on induction with metallic mirrors used only as conducting vessels exposed towards a very clear sky at night time and of such concavity that nothing but the firmament could be visible from the lowest part of the concave n fig 143 such mirrors when electrified as by connexion with a leyden jar and examined by a carrier ball readily gave electricity at the lowest part of their concavity if in a room but i was in hopes of finding that circumstanced as before stated they would give little or none at the same spot if the atmosphere above really terminated in a vacuum i was disappointed in the conclusion for i obtained as much electricity there as before but on discovering the action of induction in curved lines 1231 found a full and satisfactory explanation of the result  1615 my theory as far as i have ventured it does not pretend to decide upon the consequences of a vacuum it is not at present limited sufficiently or rendered precise enough either by experiments relating to spaces void of matter or those of other kinds to indicate what would happen in the vacuum case i have only as yet endeavoured to establish what all the facts seem to prove that when electrical phenomena as those of induction conduction insulation and discharge occur they depend on and are produced by the action of contiguous particles of matter the next existing particle being considered as the contiguous one and i have further assumed that these particles are polarized that each exhibits the two forces or the force in two directions 1295 1298 and that they act at a distance only by acting on the contiguous and intermediate particles  1616 but assuming that a perfect vacuum were to intervene in the course of the lines of inductive action 1304 it does not follow from this theory that the particles on opposite sides of such a vacuum could not act on each other suppose it possible for a positively electrified particle to be in the centre of a vacuum an inch in diameter nothing in my present views forbids that the particle should act at the distance of half an inch on all the particles forming the inner superficies of the bounding sphere and with a force consistent with the wellknown law of the squares of the distance but suppose the sphere of an inch were full of insulating matter the electrified particle would not then according to my notion act directly on the distant particles but on those in immediate association with it employing all its power in polarizing them producing in them negative force equal in amount to its own positive force and directed towards the latter and positive force of equal amount directed outwards and acting in the same manner upon the layer of particles next in succession so that ultimately those particles in the surface of a sphere of half an inch radius which were acted on directly when that sphere was a vacuum will now be acted on indirectly as respects the central particle or source of action ie they will be polarized in the same way and with the same amount of force   § 19 nature of the electric current   1617 the word current is so expressive in common language that when applied in the consideration of electrical phenomena we can hardly divest it sufficiently of its meaning or prevent our minds from being prejudiced by it 283 511 i shall use it in its common electrical sense namely to express generally a certain condition and relation of electrical forces supposed to be in progression  1618 a current is produced both by excitement and discharge and whatsoever the variation of the two general causes may be the effect remains the same thus excitement may occur in many ways as by friction chemical action influence of heat change of condition induction c and discharge has the forms of conduction electrolyzation disruptive discharge and convection yet the current connected with these actions when it occurs appears in all cases to be the same this constancy in the character of the current notwithstanding the particular and great variations which may be made in the mode of its occurrence is exceedingly striking and important and its investigation and development promise to supply the most open and advantageous road to a true and intimate understanding of the nature of electrical forces  1619 as yet the phenomena of the current have presented nothing in opposition to the view i have taken of the nature of induction as an action of contiguous particles i have endeavoured to divest myself of prejudices and to look for contradictions but i have not perceived any in conductive electrolytic convective or disruptive discharge  1620 looking at the current as a cause it exerts very extraordinary and diverse powers not only in its course and on the bodies in which it exists but collaterally as in inductive or magnetic phenomena  1621 electrolytic actionone of its direct actions is the exertion of pure chemical force this being a result which has now been examined to a considerable extent the effect is found to be constant and definite for the quantity of electric force discharged 783 c and beyond that the intensity required is in relation to the intensity of the affinity or forces to be overcome 904 906 911 the current and its consequences are here proportionate the one may be employed to represent the other no part of the effect of either is lost or gained so that the case is a strict one and yet it is the very case which most strikingly illustrates the doctrine that induction is an action of contiguous particles 1164 1343  1622 the process of electrolytic discharge appears to me to be in close analogy and perhaps in its nature identical with another process of discharge which at first seems very different from it i mean convection 1347 1572 in the latter case the particles may travel for yards across a chamber they may produce strong winds in the air so as to move machinery and in fluids as oil of turpentine may even shake the hand and carry heavy metallic bodies abouta and yet i do not see that the force either in kind or action is at all different to that by which a particle of hydrogen leaves one particle of oxygen to go to another or by which a particle of oxygen travels in the contrary direction    a if a metallic vessel three or four inches deep containing oil of   turpentine be insulated and electrified and a rod with a ball an   inch or more in diameter at the end have the ball immersed in the   fluid whilst the end is held in the hand the mechanical force   generated when the ball is moved to and from the sides of the vessel   will soon be evident to the experimenter  1623 travelling particles of the air can effect chemical changes just as well as the contact of a fixed platina electrode or that of a combining electrode or the ions of a decomposing electrolyte 453 471 and in the experiment formerly described where eight places of decomposition were rendered active by one current 469 and where charged particles of air in motion were the only electrical means of connecting these parts of the current it seems to me that the action of the particles of the electrolyte and of the air were essentially the same a particle of air was rendered positive it travelled in a certain determinate direction and coming to an electrolyte communicated its powers an equal amount of positive force was accordingly acquired by another particle the hydrogen and the latter so charged travelled as the former did and in the same direction until it came to another particle and transferred its power and motion making that other particle active now though the particle of air travelled over a visible and occasionally a large space whilst the particle of the electrolyte moved over an exceedingly small one though the air particle might be oxygen nitrogen or hydrogen receiving its charge from force of high intensity whilst the electrolytic particle of hydrogen had a natural aptness to receive the positive condition with extreme facility though the air particle might be charged with very little electricity at a very high intensity by one process whilst the hydrogen particle might be charged with much electricity at a very low intensity by another process these are not differences of kind as relates to the final discharging action of these particles but only of degree not essential differences which make things unlike but such differences as give to things similar in their nature that great variety which fits them for their office in the system of the universe  1624 so when a particle of air or of dust in it electrified at a negative point moves on through the influence of the inductive forces 1572 to the next positive surface and after discharge passes away it seems to me to represent exactly that particle of oxygen which having been rendered negative in the electrolyte is urged by the same disposition of inductive forces and going to the positive platina electrode is there discharged and then passes away as the air or dust did before it  1625 heat is another direct effect of the current upon substances in which it occurs and it becomes a very important question as to the relation of the electric and heating forces whether the latter is always definite in amounta there are many cases even amongst bodies which conduct without change that at present are irreconcileable with the assumption that it isb but there are also many which indicate that when proper limitations are applied the heat produced is definite harris has shown this for a given length of current in a metallic wire using common electricityc and de la rive has proved the same point for voltaic electricity by his beautiful application of breguets thermometerd    a see de la rives

decomposition the results are still more complicated but important steps have been taken in the investigation of this branch of the subject by de la rivea and others and it is more than probable that when the right limitations are applied constant and definite results will here also be obtained    a bib universelle 1829 xl 49 and ritchie phil trans 1832 p   296                                       1627 it is a most important part of the character of the current and essentially connected with its very nature that it is always the same the two forces are everywhere in it there is never one current of force or one fluid only any one part of the current may as respects the presence of the two forces there be considered as precisely the same with any other part and the numerous experiments which imply their possible separation as well as the theoretical expressions which being used daily assume it are i think in contradiction with facts 511 c it appears to me to be as impossible to assume a current of positive or a current of negative force alone or of the two at once with any predominance of one over the other as it is to give an absolute charge to matter 516 1169 1177  1628 the establishment of this truth if as i think it be a truth or on the other hand the disproof of it is of the greatest consequence if as a first principle we can establish that the centres of the two forces or elements of force never can be separated to any sensible distance or at all events not further than the space between two contiguous particles 1615 or if we can establish the contrary conclusion how much more clear is our view of what lies before us and how much less embarrassed the ground over which we have to pass in attaining to it than if we remain halting between two opinions and if with that feeling we rigidly test every experiment which bears upon the point as far as our prejudices will let us 1161 instead of permitting them with a theoretical expression to pass too easily away are we not much more likely to attain the real truth and from that proceed with safety to what is at present unknown  1629 i say these things not i hope to advance a particular view but to draw the strict attention of those who are able to investigate and judge of the matter to what must be a turning point in the theory of electricity to a separation of two roads one only of which can be right and i hope i may be allowed to go a little further into the facts which have driven me to the view i have just given  1630 when a wire in the voltaic circuit is heated the temperature frequently rises first or most at one end if this effect were due to any relation of positive or negative as respects the current it would be exceedingly important i therefore examined several such cases but when keeping the contacts of the wire and its position to neighbouring things unchanged i altered the direction of the current i found that the effect remained unaltered showing that it depended not upon the direction of the current but on other circumstances so there is here no evidence of a difference between one part of the circuit and another  1631 the same point ie uniformity in every part may be illustrated by what may be considered as the inexhaustible nature of the current when producing particular effects for these effects depend upon transfer only and do not consume the power thus a current which will heat one inch of platina wire will heat a hundred inches 853 note if a current be sustained in a constant state it will decompose the fluid in one voltameter only or in twenty others if they be placed in the circuit in each to an amount equal to that in the single one  1632 again in cases of disruptive discharge as in the spark there is frequently a dark part 1422 which by professor johnson has been called the neutral pointa and this has given rise to the use of expressions implying that there are two electricities existing separately which passing to that spot there combine and neutralize each otherb but if such expressions are understood as correctly indicating that positive electricity alone is moving between the positive ball and that spot and negative electricity only between the negative ball and that spot then what strange conditions these parts must be in conditions which to my mind are every way unlike those which really occur in such a case one part of a current would consist of positive electricity only and that moving in one direction another part would consist of negative electricity only and that moving in the other direction and a third part would consist of an accumulation of the two electricities not moving in either direction but mixing up together and being in a relation to each other utterly unlike any relation which could be supposed to exist in the two former portions of the discharge this does not seem to me to be natural in a current whatever form the discharge may take or whatever part of the circuit or current is referred to as much positive force as is there exerted in one direction so much negative force is there exerted in the other if it were not so we should have bodies electrified not merely positive and negative but on occasions in a most extraordinary manner one being charged with five ten or twenty times as much of both positive and negative electricity in equal quantities as another at present however there is no known fact indicating such states    a sillimans journal 1834 xxv p 57    b thomson on heat and electricity p 171  1633 even in cases of convection or carrying discharge the statement that the current is everywhere the same must in effect be true 1627 for how otherwise could the results formerly described occur when currents of air constituted the mode of discharge between the portions of paper moistened with iodide of potassium or sulphate of soda 465 469 decomposition occurred and i have since ascertained that whether a current of positive air issued from a spot or one of negative air passed towards it the effect of the evolution of iodine or of acid was the same whilst the reversed currents produced alkali so also in the magnetic experiments 307 whether the discharge was effected by the introduction of a wire or the occurrence of a spark or the passage of convective currents either one way or the other depending on the electrified state of the particles the result was the same being in all cases dependent upon the perfect current  1634 hence the section of a current compared with other sections of the same current must be a constant quantity if the actions exerted be of the same kind or if of different kinds then the forms under which the effects are produced are equivalent to each other and experimentally convertible at pleasure it is in sections therefore we must look for identity of electrical force even to the sections of sparks and carrying actions as well as those of wires and electrolytes  1635 in illustration of the utility and importance of establishing that which may be the true principle i will refer to a few cases the doctrine of unipolarity as formerly stated and i think generally understooda is evidently inconsistent with my view of a current 1627 and the later singular phenomena of poles and flames described by erman and othersb partake of the same inconsistency of character if a unipolar body could exist ie one that could conduct the one electricity and not the other what very new characters we should have a right to expect in the currents of single electricities passing through them and how greatly ought they to differ not only from the common current which is supposed to have both electricities travelling in opposite directions in equal amount at the same time but also from each other the facts which are excellent have however gradually been more correctly explained by becquerelc andrewsd and others and i understand that professor ohmse has perfected the work in his close examination of all the phenomena and after showing that similar phenomena can take place with good conductors proves that with soap c many of the effects are the mere consequences of the bodies evolved by electrolytic action    a erman annales de chimie 1807 lxi p 115 davys elements p   168 biot ency brit supp iv p 444 becquerel traité i p 167   de la rive bib univ 1837 vii 392    b erman

heft 8 not   understanding german it is with extreme regret i confess i have not   access and cannot do justice to the many most valuable papers in   experimental electricity published in that language i take this   opportunity also of stating another circumstance which occasions me   great trouble and as i find by experience may make me seemingly   regardless of the labours of othersit is a gradual loss of memory   for some years past and now often when i read a memoir i remember   that i have seen it before and would have rejoiced if at the right   time i could have recollected and referred to it in the progress of my   own papersmf  1636 i conclude therefore that the facts upon which the doctrine of unipolarity was founded are not adverse to that unity and indivisibility of character which i have stated the current to possess any more than the phenomena of the pile itself which might well bear comparison with those of unipolar bodies are opposed to it probably the effects which have been called effects of unipolarity and the peculiar differences of the positive and negative surface when discharging into air gases or other dielectrics 1480 1525 which have been already referred to may have considerable relation to each othera    a see also hare in sillimans journal 1833 xxiv 246                                       1637 m de la rive has recently described a peculiar and remarkable effect of heat on a current when passing between electrodes and a fluida it is that if platina electrodes dip into acidulated water no change is produced in the passing current by making the positive electrode hotter or colder whereas making the negative electrode hotter increased the deflexion of a galvanometer affected by the current from 12° to 30° and even 45° whilst making it colder diminished the current in the same high proportions    a bibliothèque universelle 1837 vii 388  1638 that one electrode should have this striking relation to heat whilst the other remained absolutely without seem to me as incompatible with what i conceived to be the character of a current as unipolarity 1627 1635 and it was therefore with some anxiety that i repeated the experiment the electrodes which i used were platina the electrolyte water containing about one sixth of sulphuric acid by weight the voltaic battery consisted of two pairs of amalgamated zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric acid and the galvanometer in the circuit was one with two needles and gave when the arrangement was complete a deflexion of 10° or 12°  1639 under these circumstances heating either electrode increased the current heating both produced still more effect when both were heated if either were cooled the effect on the current fell in proportion the proportion of effect due to heating this or that electrode varied but on the whole heating the negative seemed to favour the passage of the current somewhat more than heating the positive whether the application of heat were by a flame applied underneath or one directed by a blowpipe from above or by a hot iron or coal the effect was the same  1640 having thus removed the difficulty out of the way of my views regarding a current i did not pursue this curious experiment further it is probable that the difference between my results and those of m de la rive may depend upon the relative values of the currents used for i employed only a weak one resulting from two pairs of plates two inches long and half an inch wide whilst m de la rive used four pairs of plates of sixteen square inches in surface                                       1641 electric discharges in the atmosphere in the form of balls of fire have occasionally been described such phenomena appear to me to be incompatible with all that we know of electricity and its modes of discharge as time is an element in the effect 1418 1436 it is possible perhaps that an electric discharge might really pass as a ball from place to place but as every thing shows that its velocity must be almost infinite and the time of its duration exceedingly small it is impossible that the eye should perceive it as anything else than a line of light that phenomena of balls of fire may appear in the atmosphere i do not mean to deny but that they have anything to do with the discharge of ordinary electricity or are at all related to lightning or atmospheric electricity is much more than doubtful                                       1642 all these considerations and many others help to confirm the conclusion drawn over and over again that the current is an indivisible thing an axis of power in every part of which both electric forces are present in equal amounta 517 1627 with conduction and electrolyzation and even discharge by spark such a view will harmonize without hurting any of our preconceived notions but as relates to convection a more startling result appears which must therefore be considered    a i am glad to refer here to the results obtained by mr christie   with magnetoelectricity philosophical transactions 1833 p 113   note as regards the current in a wire they confirm everything that i   am contending for  1643 if two balls a and b be electrified in opposite states and held within each others influence the moment they move towards each other a current or those effects which are understood by the word current will be produced whether a move towards b or b move in the opposite direction towards a a current and in both cases having the same direction will result if a and b move from each other then a current in the opposite direction or equivalent effects will be produced  1644 or as charge exists only by induction 1178 1299 and a body when electrified is necessarily in relation to other bodies in the opposite state so if a ball be electrified positively in the middle of a room and be then moved in any direction effects will be produced as current in the same direction to use the conventional mode of expression had existed or if the ball be negatively electrified and then moved effects as if a current in a direction contrary to that of the motion had been formed will be produced  1645 i am saying of a single particle or of two what i have before said in effect of many 1633 if the former account of currents be true then that just stated must be a necessary result and though the statement may seem startling at first it is to be considered that according to my theory of induction the charged conductor or particle is related to the distant conductor in the opposite state or that which terminates the extent of the induction by all the intermediate particles 1165 1295 these becoming polarized exactly as the particles of a solid electrolyte do when interposed between the two electrodes hence the conclusion regarding the unity and identity of the current in the case of convection jointly with the former cases is not so strange as it might at first appear                                       1646 there is a very remarkable phenomenon or effect of the electrolytic discharge first pointed out i believe by mr porrett of the accumulation of fluid under decomposing action in the current on one side of an interposed diaphragma it is a mechanical result and as the liquid passes from the positive towards the negative electrode in all the known cases it seems to establish a relation to the polar condition of the dielectric in which the current exists 1164 1525 it has not as yet been sufficiently investigated by experiment for de la rive saysb it requires that the water should be a bad conductor as for instance distilled water the effect not happening with strong solutions whereas dutrochet saysc the contrary is the case and that the effect is not directly due to the electric current    a annals of philosophy 1816 viii p 75    b annales de chimie 1835 xxviii p 196    c annales de chimie 1832 xlix p 423  1647 becquerel in his traité de lelectricité has brought together the considerations which arise for and against the opinion that the effect generally is an electric effecta though i have no decisive fact to quote at present i cannot refrain from venturing an opinion that the effect is analogous both to combination and convection 1623 being a case of carrying due to the relation of the diaphragm and the fluid in contact with it through which the electric discharge is jointly effected and further that the peculiar relation of positive and negative small and large surfaces already referred to 1482 1503 1525 may be the direct cause of the fluid and the diaphragm travelling in contrary but determinate directions a very valuable experiment has been made by m becquerel with particles of clayb which will probably bear importantly on this point    a vol iv p 192 197    b traité de lelectricité i p 285                                       1648 as long as the terms current and electrodynamic are used to express those relations of the electric forces in which progression of either fluids or effects are supposed to occur 283 so long will the idea of velocity be associated with them and this will perhaps be more especially the case if the hypothesis of a fluid or fluids be adopted  1649 hence has arisen the desire of estimating this velocity either directly or by some effect dependent on it and amongst the endeavours to do this correctly may be mentioned especially those of dr watsona in 1748 and of professor wheatstoneb in 1834 the electricity in the early trials being supposed to travel from end to end of the arrangement but in the later investigations a distinction occasionally appearing to be made between the transmission of the effect and of the supposed fluid by the motion of whose particles that effect is produced    a philosophical transactions 1748    b ibid 1834 p 583  1650 electrolytic action has a remarkable bearing upon this question of the velocity of the current especially as connected with the theory of an electric fluid or fluids in it there is an evident transfer of power with the transfer of each particle of the anion or cathion present to the next particles of the cathion or anion and as the amount of power is definite we have in this way a means of localizing as it were the force identifying it by the particle and dealing it out in successive portions which leads i think to very striking results  1651 suppose for instance that water is undergoing decomposition by the powers of a voltaic battery each particle of hydrogen as it moves one way or of oxygen as it moves in the other direction will transfer a certain amount of electrical force associated with it in the form of chemical affinity 822 852 918 onwards through a distance which is equal to that through which the particle itself has moved this transfer will be accompanied by a corresponding movement in the electrical forces throughout every part of the circuit formed 1627 1634 and its effects may be estimated as for instance by the heating of a wire 853 at any particular section of the current however distant if the water be a cube of an inch in the side the electrodes touching each by a surface of one square inch and being an inch apart then by the time that a tenth of it or 2525 grs is decomposed the particles of oxygen and hydrogen throughout the mass may be considered as having moved relatively to each other in opposite directions to the amount of the tenth of an inch ie that two particles at first in combination will after the motion be the tenth of an inch apart other motions which occur in the fluid will not at all interfere with this result for they have no power of accelerating or retarding the electric discharge and possess in fact no relation to it  1652 the quantity of electricity in 2525 grains of water is according to an estimate of the force which i formerly made 861 equal to above 24 millions of charges of a large leyden battery or it would have kept any length of a platina wire 1104 of an inch in diameter redhot for an hour and a half 853 this result though given only as an approximation i have seen no reason as yet to alter and it is confirmed generally by the experiments and results of m pouilleta according to mr wheatstones experiments the influence or effects of the current would appear at a distance of 576000 miles in a secondb we have therefore in this view of the matter on the one hand an enormous quantity of power equal to a most destructive thunderstorm appearing instantly at the distance of 576000 miles from its source and on the other a quiet effect in producing which the power had taken an hour and a half to travel through the tenth of an inch yet these are the equivalents to each other being effects observed at the sections of one and the same current 1634    a becquerel traité de lelectricité v p 278    b philosophical transactions 1834 p 589                                       1653 it is time that i should call attention to the lateral or transverse forces of the current the great things which have been achieved by oersted arago ampère davy de la rive and others and the high degree of simplification which has been introduced into their arrangement by the theory of ampère have not only done their full service in advancing most rapidly this branch of knowledge but have secured to it such attention that there is no necessity for urging on its pursuit i refer of course to magnetic action and its relations but though this is the only recognised lateral action of the current there is great reason for believing that others exist and would by their discovery reward a close search for them 951  1654 the magnetic or transverse action of the current seems to be in a most extraordinary degree independent of those variations or modes of action which it presents directly in its course it consequently is of the more value to us as it gives us a higher relation of the power than any that might have varied with each mode of discharge this discharge whether it be by conduction through a wire with infinite velocity 1652 or by electrolyzation with its corresponding and exceeding slow motion 1651 or by spark and probably even by convection produces a transverse magnetic action always the same in kind and direction  1655 it has been shown by several experimenters that whilst the discharge is of the same kind the amount of lateral or magnetic force is very constant 216 366 367 368 376 but when we wish to compare discharge of different kinds for the important purpose of ascertaining whether the same amount of current will in its different forms produce the same amount of transverse action we find the data very imperfect davy noticed that when the electric current was passing through an aqueous solution it affected a magnetic needlea and dr ritchie says that the current in the electrolyte is as magnetic as that in a metallic wireb and has caused water to revolve round a magnet as a wire carrying the current would revolve    a philosophical transactions 1821 p 426    b ibid 1832 p 294  1656 disruptive discharge produces its magnetic effects a strong spark passed transversely to a steel needle will magnetise it as well as if the electricity of the spark were conducted by a metallic wire occupying the line of discharge and sir h davy has shown that the discharge of a voltaic battery in vacuo is affected and has motion given to it by approximated magnetsa    a philosophical transactions 1821 p 427  1657 thus the three very different modes of discharge namely conduction electrolyzation and disruptive discharge agree in producing the important transverse phenomenon of magnetism whether convection or carrying discharge will produce the same phenomenon has not been determined and the few experiments i have as yet had time to make do not enable me to answer in the affirmative                                       1658 having arrived at this point in the consideration of the current and in the endeavour to apply its phenomena as tests of the truth or fallacy of the theory of induction which i have ventured to set forth i am now very much tempted to indulge in a few speculations respecting its lateral action and its possible connexion with the transverse condition of the lines of ordinary induction 1165 1304a i have long sought and still seek for an effect or condition which shall be to statical electricity what magnetic force is to current electricity 1411 for as the lines of discharge are associated with a certain transverse effect so it appeared to me impossible but that the lines of tension or of inductive action which of necessity precede that discharge should also have their correspondent transverse condition or effect 951    a refer for further investigations to 17091736dec 1838  1659 according to the beautiful theory of ampère the transverse force of a current may be represented by its attraction for a similar current and its repulsion of a contrary current may not then the equivalent transverse force of static electricity be represented by that lateral tension or repulsion which the lines of inductive action appear to possess 1304 then again when current or discharge occurs between two bodies previously under inductrical relations to each other the lines of inductive force will weaken and fade away and as their lateral repulsive tension diminishes will contract and ultimately disappear in the line of discharge may not this be an effect identical with the attractions of similar currents ie may not the passage of static electricity into current electricity and that of the lateral tension of the lines of inductive force into the lateral attraction of lines of similar discharge have the same relation and dependences and run parallel to each other  1660 the phenomena of induction amongst currents which i had the good fortune to discover some years ago 6 c 1048 may perchance here form a connecting link in the series of effects when a current is first formed it tends to produce a current in the contrary direction in all the matter around it and if that matter have conducting properties and be fitly circumstanced such a current is produced on the contrary when the original current is stopped one in the same direction tends to form all around it and in conducting matter properly arranged will be excited  1661 now though we perceive the effects only in that portion of matter which being in the neighbourhood has conducting properties yet hypothetically it is probable that the nonconducting matter has also its relations to and is affected by the disturbing cause though we have not yet discovered them again and again the relation of conductors and nonconductors has been shown to be one not of opposition in kind but only of degree 1334 1603 and therefore for this as well as for other reasons it is probable that what will affect a conductor will affect an insulator also producing perhaps what may deserve the term of the electrotonic state 60 242 1114  1662 it is the feeling of the necessity of some lateral connexion between the lines of electric force 1114 of some link in the chain of effects as yet unrecognised that urges me to the expression of these speculations the same feeling has led me to make many experiments on the introduction of insulating dielectrics having different inductive capacities 1270 1277 between magnetic poles and wires carrying currents so as to pass across the lines of magnetic force i have employed such bodies both at rest and in motion without as yet being able to detect any influence produced by them but i do by no means consider the experiments as sufficiently delicate and intend very shortly to render them more decisivea    a see onwards 17111726dec 1838  1663 i think the hypothetical question may at present be put thus can such considerations as those already generally expressed 1658 account for the transverse effects of electrical currents are two such currents in relation to each other merely by the inductive condition of the particles of matter between them or are they in relation by some higher quality and condition 1654 which acting at a distance and not by the intermediate particles has like the force of gravity no relation to them  1664 if the latter be the case then when electricity is acting upon and in matter its direct and its transverse action are essentially different in their nature for the former if i am correct will depend upon the contiguous particles and the latter will not as i have said before this may be so and i incline to that view at present but i am desirous of suggesting considerations why it may not that the question may be thoroughly sifted  1665 the transverse power has a character of polarity impressed upon it in the simplest forms it appears as attraction or repulsion according as the currents are in the same or different directions in the current and the magnet it takes up the condition of tangential forces and in magnets and their particles produces poles since the experiments have been made which have persuaded me that the polar forces of electricity as in induction and electrolytic action 1298 1343 show effects at a distance only by means of the polarized contiguous and intervening particles i have been led to expect that all polar forces act in the same general manner and the other kinds of phenomena which one can bring to bear upon the subject seem fitted to strengthen that expectation thus in crystallizations the effect is transmitted from particle to particle and in this manner in acetic acid or freezing water a crystal a few inches or even a couple of feet in length will form in less than a second but progressively and by a transmission of power from particle to particle and as far as i remember no case of polar action or partaking of polar action except the one under discussion can be found which does not act by contiguous particlesa it is apparently of the nature of polar forces that such should be the case for the one force either finds or developed the contrary force near to it and has therefore no occasion to seek for it at a distance    a i mean by contiguous particles those which are next to each other   not that there is no space between them see 1616  1666 but leaving these hypothetical notions respecting the nature of the lateral action out of sight and returning to the direct effects i think that the phenomena examined and reasoning employed in this and the two preceding papers tend to confirm the view first taken 1464 namely that ordinary inductive action and the effects dependent upon it are due to an action of the contiguous particles of the dielectric interposed between the charged surfaces or parts which constitute as it were the terminations of the effect the great point of distinction and power if it have any in the theory is the making the dielectric of essential and specific importance instead of leaving it as it were a mere accidental circumstance or the simple representative of space having no more influence over the phenomena than the space occupied by it i have still certain other results and views respecting the nature of the electrical forces and excitation which are connected with the present theory and unless upon further consideration they sink in my estimation i shall very shortly put them into form as another series of these electrical researches  royal institution february 14th 1838     fourteenth series   § 20 nature of the electric force or forces § 21 relation of the electric and magnetic forces § 22 note on electrical excitation  received june 21 1838read june 21 1838  § 20 nature of the electric force or forces   1667 the theory of induction set forth and illustrated in the three preceding series of experimental researches does not assume anything new as to the nature of the electric force or forces but only as to their distribution the effects may depend upon the association of one electric fluid with the particles of matter as in the theory of franklin epinus cavendish and mossotti or they may depend upon the association of two electric fluids as in the theory of dufay and poisson or they may not depend upon anything which can properly be called the electric fluid but on vibrations or other affections of the matter in which they appear the theory is unaffected by such differences in the mode of viewing the nature of the forces and though it professes to perform the important office of stating how the powers are arranged at least in inductive phenomena it does not as far as i can yet perceive supply a single experiment which can be considered as a distinguishing test of the truth of any one of these various views  1668 but to ascertain how the forces are arranged to trace them in their various relations to the particles of matter to determine their general laws and also the specific differences which occur under these laws is as important as if not more so than to know whether the forces reside in a fluid or not and with the hope of assisting in this research i shall offer some further developments theoretical and experimental of the conditions under which i suppose the particles of matter are placed when exhibiting inductive phenomena  1669 the theory assumes that all the particles whether of insulating or conducting matter are as wholes conductors  1670 that not being polar in their normal state they can become so by the influence of neighbouring charged particles the polar state being developed at the instant exactly as in an insulated conducting mass consisting of many particles  1671 that the particles when polarized are in a forced state and tend to return to their normal or natural condition  1672 that being as wholes conductors they can readily be charged either bodily or polarly  1673 that particles which being contiguousa are also in the line of inductive action can communicate or transfer their polar forces one to another more or less readily    a see note to 1164dec 1838  1674 that those doing so less readily require the polar forces to be raised to a higher degree before this transference or communication takes place  1675 that the ready communication of forces between contiguous particles constitutes conduction and the difficult communication insulation conductors and insulators being bodies whose particles naturally possess the property of communicating their respective forces easily or with difficulty having these differences just as they have differences of any other natural property  1676 that ordinary induction is the effect resulting from the action of matter charged with excited or free electricity upon insulating matter tending to produce in it an equal amount of the contrary state  1677 that it can do this only by polarizing the particles contiguous to it which perform the same office to the next and these again to those beyond and that thus the action is propagated from the excited body to the next conducting mass and there renders the contrary force evident in consequence of the effect of communication which supervenes in the conducting mass upon the polarization of the particles of that body 1675  1678 that therefore induction can only take place through or across insulators that induction is insulation it being the necessary consequence of the state of the particles and the mode in which the influence of electrical forces is transferred or transmitted through or across such insulating media  1679 the particles of an insulating dielectric whilst under induction may be compared to a series of small magnetic needles or more correctly still to a series of small insulated conductors if the space round a charged globe were filled with a mixture of an insulating dielectric as oil of turpentine or air and small globular conductors as shot the latter being at a little distance from each other so as to be insulated then these would in their condition and action exactly resemble what i consider to be the condition and action of the particles of the insulating dielectric itself 1337 if the globe were charged these little conductors would all be polar if the globe were discharged they would all return to their normal state to be polarized again upon the recharging of the globe the state developed by induction through such particles on a mass of conducting mutter at a distance would be of the contrary kind and exactly equal in amount to the force in the inductric globe there would be a lateral diffusion of force 1224 1297 because each polarized sphere would be in an active or tense relation to all those contiguous to it just as one magnet can affect two or more magnetic needles near it and these again a still greater number beyond them hence would result the production of curved lines of inductive force if the inducteous body in such a mixed dielectric were an uninsulated metallic ball 1219 c or other properly shaped mass such curved lines are the consequences of the two electric forces arranged as i have assumed them to be and that the inductive force can be directed in such curved lines is the strongest proof of the presence of the two powers and the polar condition of the dielectric particles  1680 i think it is evident that in the case stated action at a distance can only result through an action of the contiguous conducting particles there is no reason why the inductive body should polarize or affect distant conductors and leave those near it namely the particles of the dielectric unaffected and everything in the form of fact and experiment with conducting masses or particles of a sensible size contradicts such a supposition  1681 a striking character of the electric power is that it is limited and exclusive and that the two forces being always present are exactly equal in amount the forces are related in one of two ways either as in the natural normal condition of an uncharged insulated conductor or as in the charged state the latter being a case of induction  1682 cases of induction are easily arranged so that the two forces being limited in their direction shall present no phenomena or indications external to the apparatus employed thus if a leyden jar having its external coating a little higher than the internal be charged and then its charging ball and rod removed such jar will present no electrical appearances so long as its outside is uninsulated the two forces which may be said to be in the coatings or in the particles of the dielectric contiguous to them are entirely engaged to each other by induction through the glass and a carrier ball 1181 applied either to the inside or outside of the jar will show no signs of electricity but if the jar be insulated and the charging ball and rod in an uncharged state and suspended by an insulating thread of white silk be restored to their place then the part projecting above the jar will give electrical indications and charge the carrier and at the same time the outside coating of the jar will be found in the opposite state and inductric towards external surrounding objects  1683 these are simple consequences of the theory whilst the charge of the inner coating could induce only through the glass towards the outer coating and the latter contained no more of the contrary force than was equivalent to it no induction external to the jar could be perceived but when the inner coating was extended by the rod and ball so that it could induce through the air towards external objects then the tension of the polarized glass molecules would by their tendency to return to the normal state fall a little and a portion of the charge passing to the surface of this new part of the inner conductor would produce inductive action through the air towards distant objects whilst at the same time a part of the force in the outer coating previously directed inwards would now be at liberty and indeed be constrained to induct outwards through the air producing in that outer coating what is sometimes called though i think very improperly free charge if a small leyden jar be converted into that form of apparatus usually known by the name of the electric well it will illustrate this action very completely  1684 the terms free charge and dissimulated electricity convey therefore erroneous notions if they are meant to imply any difference as to the mode or kind of action the charge upon an insulated conductor in the middle of a room is in the same relation to the walls of that room as the charge upon the inner coating of a leyden jar is to the outer coating of the same jar the one is not more free or more dissimulated than the other and when sometimes we make electricity appear where it was not evident before as upon the outside of a charged jar when after insulating it we touch the inner coating it is only because we divert more or less of the inductive force from one direction into another for not the slightest change is in such circumstances impressed upon the character or action of the force                                       1685 having given this general theoretical view i will now notice particular points relating to the nature of the assumed electric polarity of the insulating dielectric particles  1686 the polar state may be considered in common induction as a forced state the particles tending to return to their normal condition it may probably be raised to a very high degree by approximation of the inductric and inducteous bodies or by other circumstances and the phenomena of electrolyzation 861 1652 1796 seem to imply that the quantity of power which can thus be accumulated on a single particle is enormous hereafter we may be able to compare corpuscular forces as those of gravity cohesion electricity and chemical affinity and in some way or other from their effects deduce their relative equivalents at present we are not able to do so but there seems no reason to doubt that their electrical which are at the same time their chemical forces 891 918 will be by far the most energetic  1687 i do not consider the powers when developed by the polarization as limited to two distinct points or spots on the surface of each particle to be considered as the poles of an axis but as resident on large portions of that surface as they are upon the surface of a conductor of sensible size when it is thrown into a polar state but it is very probable notwithstanding that the particles of different bodies may present specific differences in this respect the powers not being equally diffused though equal in quantity other circumstances also as form and quality giving to each a peculiar polar relation it is perhaps to the existence of some such differences as these that we may attribute the specific actions of the different dielectrics in relation to discharge1394 1508 thus with respect to oxygen and nitrogen singular contrasts were presented when spark and brush discharge were made to take place in these gases as may be seen by reference to the table in paragraph 1518 of the thirteenth series for with nitrogen when the small negative or the large positive ball was rendered inductric the effects corresponded with those which in oxygen were produced when the small positive or the large negative ball was rendered inductric  1688 in such solid bodies as glass lac sulphur c the particles appear to be able to become polarized in all directions for a mass when experimented upon so as to ascertain its inductive capacity in three or more directions 1690 gives no indication of a difference now as the particles are fixed in the mass and as the direction of the induction through them must change with its change relative to the mass the constant effect indicates that they can be polarized electrically in any direction this accords with the view already taken of each particle as a whole being a conductor 1669 and as an experimental fact helps to confirm that view  1689 but though particles may thus be polarized in any direction under the influence of powers which are probably of extreme energy 1686 it does not follow that each particle may not tend to polarize to a greater degree or with more facility in one direction than another or that different kinds may not have specific differences in this respect as they have differences of conducting and other powers 1296 1326 1395 i sought with great anxiety for a relation of this nature and selecting crystalline bodies as those in which all the particles are symmetrically placed and therefore best fitted to indicate any result which might depend upon variation of the direction of the forces to the direction of the particles in which they were developed experimented very carefully with them i was the more strongly stimulated to this inquiry by the beautiful electrical condition of the crystalline bodies tourmaline and boracite and hoped also to discover a relation between electric polarity and that of crystallization or even of cohesion itself 1316 my experiments have not established any connexion of the kind sought for but as i think it of equal importance to show either that there is or is not such a relation i shall briefly describe the results  1690 the form of experiment was as follows a brass ball 073 of an inch in diameter fixed at the end of a horizontal brass rod and that at the end of a brass cylinder was by means of the latter connected with a large leyden battery 291 by perfect metallic communications the object being to keep that ball by its connexion with the charged battery in an electrified state very nearly uniform for half an hour at a time this was the inductric ball the inducteous ball was the carrier of the torsion electrometer 1229 1314 and the dielectric between them was a cube cut from a crystal so that two of its faces should be perpendicular to the optical axis whilst the other four were parallel to it a small projecting piece of shelllac was fixed on the inductric ball at that part opposite to the attachment of the brass rod for the purpose of preventing actual contact between the ball and the crystal cube a coat of shelllac was also attached to that side of the carrier ball which was to be towards the cube being also that side which was furthest from the repelled ball in the electrometer when placed in its position in that instrument the cube was covered with a thin coat of shelllac dissolved in alcohol to prevent the deposition of damp upon its surface from the air it was supported upon a small table of shelllac fixed on the top of a stem of the same substance the latter being of sufficient strength to sustain the cube and yet flexible enough from its length to act as a spring and allow the cube to bear when in its place against the shelllac on the inductric ball  illustration  1691 thus it was easy to bring the inducteous ball always to the same distance from the inductric bull and to uninsulate and insulate it again in its place and then after measuring the force in the electrometer 1181 to return it to its place opposite to the inductric ball for a second observation or it was easy by revolving the stand which supported the cube to bring four of its faces in succession towards the inductric ball and so observe the force when the lines of inductive action 1304 coincided with or were transverse to the direction of the optical axis of the crystal generally from twenty to twentyeight observations were made in succession upon the four vertical faces of a cube and then an average expression of the inductive force was obtained and compared with similar averages obtained at other times every precaution being taken to secure accurate results  1692 the first cube used was of rock crystal it was 07 of an inch in the side it presented a remarkable and constant difference the average of not less than 197 observations giving 100 for the specific inductive capacity in the direction coinciding with the optical axis of the cube whilst 9359 and 9331 were the expressions for the two transverse directions  1693 but with a second cube of rock crystal corresponding results were not obtained it was 077 of an inch in the side the average of many experiments gave 100 for the specific inductive capacity coinciding with the direction of the optical axis and 986 and 9992 for the two other directions  1694 lord ashley whom i have found ever ready to advance the cause of science obtained for me the loan of three globes of rock crystal belonging to her grace the duchess of sutherland for the purposes of this investigation two had such fissures as to render them unfit for the experiments 1193 1698 the third which was very superior gave me no indications of any difference in the inductive force for different directions  1695 i then used cubes of iceland spar one 05 of an inch in diameter gave 100 for the axial direction and 9866 and 9574 for the two cross directions the other 08 of an inch in the side gave 100 for the axial direction whilst 10173 and 10186 were the numbers for the cross direction  1696 besides these differences there were others which i do not think it needful to state since the main point is not confirmed for though the experiments with the first cube raised great expectation they have not been generalized by those which followed i have no doubt of the results as to that cube but they cannot as yet be referred to crystallization there are in the cube some faintly coloured layers parallel to the optical axis and the matter which colours them may have an influence but then the layers are also nearly parallel to a cross direction and if at all influential should show some effect in that direction also which they did not  1697 in some of the experiments one half or one part of a cube showed a superiority to another part and this i could not trace to any charge the different parts had received it was found that the varnishing of the cubes prevented any communication of charge to them except in a few experiments a small degree of the negative state or that which was contrary to the state of the inductric ball 1564 1566  1698 i think it right to say that as far as i could perceive the insulating character of the cubes used was perfect or at least so nearly perfect as to bear a comparison with shelllac glass c 1255 as to the cause of the differences other than regular crystalline structure there may be several thus minute fissures in the crystal insensible to the eye may be so disposed as to produce a sensible electrical difference 1193 or the crystallization may be irregular or the substance may not be quite pure and if we consider how minute a quantity of matter will alter greatly the conducting power of water it will seem not unlikely that a little extraneous matter diffused through the whole or part of a cube may produce effects sufficient to account for all the irregularities of action that have been observed  1699 an important inquiry regarding the electrical polarity of the particles of an insulating dielectric is whether it be the molecules of the particular substance acted on or the component or ultimate particles which thus act the part of insulated conducting polarizing portions 1669  1700 the conclusion i have arrived at is that it is the molecules of the substance which polarize as wholes 1347 and that however complicated the composition of a body may be all those particles or atoms which are held together by chemical affinity to form one molecule of the resulting body act as one conducting mass or particle when inductive phenomena and polarization are produced in the substance of which it is a part  1701 this conclusion is founded on several considerations thus if we observe the insulating and conducting power of elements when they are used as dielectrics we find some as sulphur phosphorus chlorine iodine c whose particles insulate and therefore polarize in a high degree whereas others as the metals give scarcely any indication of possessing a sensible proportion of this power 1328 their particles freely conducting one to another yet when these enter into combination they form substances having no direct relation apparently in this respect to their elements for water sulphuric acid and such compounds formed of insulating elements conduct by comparison freely whilst oxide of lead flint glass borate of lead and other metallic compounds containing very high proportions of conducting matter insulate excellently well taking oxide of lead therefore as the illustration i conceive that it is not the particles of oxygen and lead which polarize separately under the act of induction but the molecules of oxide of lead which exhibit this effect all the elements of one particle of the resulting body being held together as parts of one conducting individual by the bonds of chemical affinity which is but another term for electrical force 918  1702 in bodies which are electrolytes we have still further reason for believing in such a state of things thus when water chloride of tin iodide of lead c in the solid state are between the electrodes of the voltaic battery their particles polarize as those of any other insulating dielectric do 1164 but when the liquid state is conferred on these substances the polarized particles divide the two halves each in a highly charged state travelling onwards until they meet other particles in an opposite and equally charged state with which they combine to the neutralization of their chemical ie their electrical forces and the reproduction of compound particles which can again polarize as wholes and again divide to repeat the same series of actions 1347  1703 but though electrolytic particles polarize as wholes it would appear very evident that in them it is not a matter of entire indifference how the particle polarizes 1689 since when free to move 380 c the polarities are ultimately distributed in reference to the elements and sums of force equivalent to the polarities and very definite in kind and amount separate as it were from each other and travel onwards with the elementary particles and though i do not pretend to know what an atom is or how it is associated or endowed with electrical force or how this force is arranged in the cases of combination and decomposition yet the strong belief i have in the electrical polarity of particles when under inductive action and the hearing of such an opinion on the general effects of induction whether ordinary or electrolytic will be my excuse i trust for a few hypothetical considerations  1704 in electrolyzation it appears that the polarized particles would because of the gradual change which has been induced upon the chemical ie the electrical forces of their elements 918 rather divide than discharge to each other without division 1348 for if their division ie their decomposition and recombination be prevented by giving them the solid state then they will insulate electricity perhaps a hundredfold more intense than that necessary for their electrolyzation 419 c hence the tension necessary for direct conduction in such bodies appears to be much higher than that for decomposition 419 1164 1344  1705 the remarkable stoppage of electrolytic conduction by solidification 380 1358 is quite consistent with these views of the dependence of that process on the polarity which is common to all insulating matter when under induction though attended by such peculiar electrochemical results in the case of electrolytes thus it may be expected that the first effect of induction is so to polarize and arrange the particles of water that the positive or hydrogen pole of each shall be from the positive electrode and towards the negative electrode whilst the negative or oxygen pole of each shall be in the contrary direction and thus when the oxygen and hydrogen of a particle of water have separated passing to and combining with other hydrogen and oxygen particles unless these new particles of water could turn round they could not take up that position necessary for their successful electrolytic polarization now solidification by fixing the water particles and preventing them from assuming that essential preliminary position prevents also their electrolysis 413 and so the transfer of forces in that manner being prevented 1347 1703 the substance acts as an ordinary insulating dielectric for it is evident by former experiments 419 1704 that the insulating tension is higher than the electrolytic tension induction through it rises to a higher degree and the polar condition of the molecules as wholes though greatly exalted is still securely maintained  1706 when decomposition happens in a fluid electrolyte i do not suppose that all the molecules in the same sectional plane 1634 part with and transfer their electrified particles or elements at once probably the discharge force for that plane is summed up on one or a few particles which decomposing travelling and recombining restore the balance of forces much as in the case of spark disruptive discharge 1406 for as those molecules resulting from particles which have just transferred power must by their position 1705 be less favourably circumstanced than others so there must be some which are most favourably disposed and these by giving way first will for the time lower the tension and produce discharge  1707 in former investigations of the action of electricity 821 c it was shown from many satisfactory cases that the quantity of electric power transferred onwards was in proportion to and was definite for a given quantity of matter moving as anion or cathion onwards in the electrolytic line of action and there was strong reason to believe that each of the particles of matter then dealt with had associated with it a definite amount of electrical force constituting its force of chemical affinity the chemical equivalents and the electrochemical equivalents being the same 836 it was also found with few and i may now perhaps say with no exceptions 1341 that only those compounds containing elements in single proportions could exhibit the characters and phenomena of electrolytes 697 oxides chlorides and other bodies containing more than one proportion of the electronegative element refusing to decompose under the influence of the electric current  1708 probable reasons for these conditions and limitations arise out of the molecular theory of induction thus when a liquid dielectric as chloride of tin consists of molecules each composed of a single particle of each of the elements then as these can convey equivalent opposite forces by their separation in opposite directions both decomposition and transfer can result but when the molecules as in the bichloride of tin consist of one particle or atom of one element and two of the other then the simplicity with which the particles may be supposed to be arranged and to act is destroyed and though it may be conceived that when the molecules of bichloride of tin are polarized as wholes by the induction across them the positive polar force might accumulate on the one particle of tin whilst the negative polar force accumulated on the two particles of chlorine associated with it and that these might respectively travel right and left to unite with other two of chlorine and one of tin in analogy with what happens in cases of compounds consisting of single proportions yet this is not altogether so evident or probable for when a particle of tin combines with two of chlorine it is difficult to conceive that there should not be some relation of the three in the resulting molecule analogous to fixed position the one particle of metal being perhaps symmetrically placed in relation to the two of chlorine and it is not difficult to conceive of such particles that they could not assume that position dependent both on their polarity and the relation of their elements which appears to be the first step in the process of electrolyzation 1345 1705   § 21 relation of the electric and magnetic forces   1709 i have already ventured a few speculations respecting the probable relation of magnetism as the transverse force of the current to the divergent or transverse force of the lines of inductive action belonging to static electricity 1658 c  1710 in the further consideration of this subject it appeared to me to be of the utmost importance to ascertain if possible whether this lateral action which we call magnetism or sometimes the induction of electrical currents 26 1048 c is extended to a distance by the action of the intermediate particles in analogy with the induction of static electricity or the various effects such as conduction discharge c which are dependent on that induction or whether its influence at a distance is altogether independent of such intermediate particles 1662  1711 i arranged two magnetoelectric helices with iron cores end to end but with an interval of an inch and three quarters between them in which interval was placed the end or pole of a bar magnet it is evident that on moving the magnetic pole from one core towards the other a current would tend to form in both helices in the one because of the lowering and in the other because of the strengthening of the magnetism induced in the respective soft iron cores the helices were connected together and also with a galvanometer so that these two currents should coincide in direction and tend by their joint force to deflect the needle of the instrument the whole arrangement was so effective and delicate that moving the magnetic pole about the eighth of an inch to and fro two or three times in periods equal to those required for the vibrations of the galvanometer needle was sufficient to cause considerable vibration in the latter thus showing readily the consequence of strengthening the influence of the magnet on the one core and helix and diminishing it on the other  1712 then without disturbing the distances of the magnet and cores plates of substances were interposed thus calling the two cores a and b a plate of shelllac was introduced between the magnetic pole and a for the time occupied by the needle in swinging one way then it was withdrawn for the time occupied in the return swing introduced again for another equal portion of time withdrawn for another portion and so on eight or nine times but not the least effect was observed on the needle in other cases the plate was alternated ie it was introduced between the magnet and a for one period of time withdrawn and introduced between the magnet and b for the second period withdrawn and restored to its first place for the third period and so on but with no effect on the needle  1713 in these experiments shelllac in plates 09 of an inch in thickness sulphur in a plate 09 of an inch in thickness and copper in a plate 07 of an inch in thickness were used without any effect and i conclude that bodies contrasted by the extremes of conducting and insulating power and opposed to each other as strongly as metals air and sulphur show no difference with respect to magnetic forces when placed in their lines of action at least under the circumstances described  1714 with a plate of iron or even a small piece of that metal as the head of a nail a very different effect was produced for then the galvanometer immediately showed its sensibility and the perfection of the general arrangement  1715 i arranged matters so that a plate of copper 02 of an inch in thickness and ten inches in diameter should have the part near the edge interposed between the magnet and the core in which situation it was first rotated rapidly and then held quiescent alternately for periods according with that required for the swinging of the needle but not the least effect upon the galvanometer was produced  1716 a plate of shelllac 06 of an inch in thickness was applied in the same manner but whether rotating or not it produced no effect  1717 occasionally the plane of rotation was directly across the magnetic curve at other times it was made as oblique as possible the direction of the rotation being also changed in different experiments but not the least effect was produced  1718 i now removed the helices with their soft iron cores and replaced them by two flat helices wound upon card board each containing fortytwo feet of silked copper wire and having no associated iron otherwise the arrangement was as before and exceedingly sensible for a very slight motion of the magnet between the helices produced an abundant vibration of the galvanometer needle  1719 the introduction of plates of shelllac sulphur or copper into the intervals between the magnet and these helices 1713 produced not the least effect whether the former were quiescent or in rapid revolution 1715 so here no evidence of the influence of the intermediate particles could be obtained 1710  1720 the magnet was then removed and replaced by a flat helix corresponding to the two former the three being parallel to each other the middle helix was so arranged that a voltaic current could be sent through it at pleasure the former galvanometer was removed and one with a double coil employed one of the lateral helices being connected with one coil and the other helix with the other coil in such manner that when a voltaic current was sent through the middle helix its inductive action 26 on the lateral helices should cause currents in them having contrary directions in the coils of the galvanometer by a little adjustment of the distances these induced currents were rendered exactly equal and the galvanometer needle remained stationary notwithstanding their frequent production in the instrument i will call the middle coil c and the external coils a and b  1721 a plate of copper 07 of an inch thick and six inches square was placed between coils c and b their respective distances remaining unchanged and then a voltaic current from twenty pairs of 4 inch plates was sent through the coil c and intermitted in periods fitted to produce an effect on the galvanometer 1712 if any difference had been produced in the effect of c on a and b but notwithstanding the presence of air in one interval and copper in the other the inductive effect was exactly alike on the two coils and as if air had occupied both intervals so that notwithstanding the facility with which any induced currents might form in the thick copper plate the coil outside of it was just as much affected by the central helix c as if no such conductor as the copper had been there 65  1722 then for the copper plate was substituted one of sulphur 09 of an inch thick still the results were exactly the same ie there was no action at the galvanometer  1723 thus it appears that when a voltaic current in one wire is exerting its inductive action to produce a contrary or a similar current in a neighbouring wire according as the primary current is commencing or ceasing it makes not the least difference whether the intervening space is occupied by such insulating bodies as air sulphur and shelllac or such conducting bodies as copper and the other nonmagnetic metals  1724 a correspondent effect was obtained with the like forces when resident in a magnet thus a single flat helix 1718 was connected with a galvanometer and a magnetic pole placed near to it then by moving the magnet to and from the helix or the helix to and from the magnet currents were produced indicated by the galvanometer  1725 the thick copper plate 1721 was afterwards interposed between the magnetic pole and the helix nevertheless on moving these to and fro effects exactly the same in direction and amount were obtained as if the copper had not been there so also on introducing a plate of sulphur into the interval not the least influence on the currents produced by motion of the magnet or coils could be obtained  1726 these results with many others which i have not thought it needful to describe would lead to the conclusion that judging by the amount of effect produced at a distance by forces transverse to the electric current ie magnetic forces the intervening matter and therefore the intervening particles have nothing to do with the phenomena or in other words that though the inductive force of static electricity is transmitted to a distance by the action of the intermediate particles 1164 1666 the transverse inductive force of currents which can also act at a distance is not transmitted by the intermediate particles in a similar way  1727 it is however very evident that such a conclusion cannot be considered as proved thus when the metal copper is between the pole and the helix 1715 1719 1725 or between the two helices 1721 we know that its particles are affected and can by proper arrangements make their peculiar state for the time very evident by the production of either electrical or magnetical effects it seems impossible to consider this effect on the particles of the intervening matter as independent of that produced by the inductric coil or magnet c on the inducteous coil or core a 1715 1721 for since the inducteous body is equally affected by the inductric body whether these intervening and affected particles of copper are present or not 1723 1725 such a supposition would imply that the particles so affected had no reaction back on the original inductric forces the more reasonable conclusion as it appears to me is to consider these affected particles as efficient in continuing the action onwards from the inductric to the inducteous body and by this very communication producing the effect of no loss of induced power at the latter  1728 but then it may be asked what is the relation of the particles of insulating bodies such as air sulphur or lac when they intervene in the line of magnetic action the answer to this is at present merely conjectural i have long thought there must be a particular condition of such bodies corresponding to the state which causes currents in metals and other conductors 26 53 191 201 213 and considering that the bodies are insulators one would expect that state to be one of tension i have by rotating nonconducting bodies near magnetic poles and poles near them and also by causing powerful electric currents to be suddenly formed and to cease around and about insulators in various directions endeavoured to make some such state sensible but have not succeeded nevertheless as any such state must be of exceedingly low intensity because of the feeble intensity of the currents which are used to induce it it may well be that the state may exist and may be discoverable by some more expert experimentalist though i have not been able to make it sensible  1729 it appears to me possible therefore and even probable that magnetic action may be communicated to a distance by the action of the intervening particles in a manner having a relation to the way in which the inductive forces of static electricity are transferred to a distance 1677 the intervening particles assuming for the time more or less of a peculiar condition which though with a very imperfect idea i have several times expressed by the term electrotonic state 60 242 1114 1661 i hope it will not be understood that i hold the settled opinion that such is the case i would rather in fact have proved the contrary namely that magnetic forces are quite independent of the matter intervening between the inductric and the inductions bodies but i cannot get over the difficulty presented by such substances as copper silver lead gold carbon and even aqueous solutions 201 213 which though they are known to assume a peculiar state whilst intervening between the bodies acting and acted upon 1727 no more interfere with the final result than those which have as yet had no peculiarity of condition discovered in them  1730 a remark important to the whole of this investigation ought to be made here although i think the galvanometer used as i have described it 1711 1720 is quite sufficient to prove that the final amount of action on each of the two coils or the two cores a and b 1713 1719 is equal yet there is an effect which may be consequent on the difference of action of two interposed bodies which it would not show as time enters as an element into these actionsa 125 it is very possible that the induced actions on the helices or cores a b though they rise to the same degree when air and copper or air and lac are contrasted as intervening substances do not do so in the same time and yet because of the length of time occupied by a vibration of the needle this difference may not be visible both effects rising to their maximum in periods so short as to make no sensible portion of that required for a vibration of the needle and so exert no visible influence upon it    a see annnles de chimie 1833 tom li pp 422 428                                       1731 if the lateral or transverse force of electrical currents or what appears to be the same thing magnetic power could be proved to be influential at a distance independently of the intervening contiguous particles then as it appears to me a real distinction of a high and important kind would be established between the natures of these two forces 1654 1664 i do not mean that the powers are independent of each other and might be rendered separately active on the contrary they are probably essentially associated 1654 but it by no means follows that they are of the same nature in common statical induction in conduction and in electrolyzation the forces at the opposite extremities of the particles which coincide with the lines of action and have commonly been distinguished by the term electric are polar and in the cases of contiguous particles act only to insensible distances whilst those which are transverse to the direction of these lines and are called magnetic are circumferential act at a distance and if not through the mediation of the intervening particles have their relations to ordinary matter entirely unlike those of the electrical forces with which they are associated  1732 to decide this question of the identity or distinction of the two kinds of power and establish their true relation would be exceedingly important the question seems fully within the reach of experiment and offers a high reward to him who will attempt its settlement  1733 i have already expressed a hope of finding an effect or condition which shall be to statical electricity what magnetic force is to current electricity 1658 if i could have proved to my own satisfaction that magnetic forces extended their influence to a distance by the conjoined action of the intervening particles in a manner analogous to that of electrical forces then i should have thought that the natural tension of the lines of inductive action 1659 or that state so often hinted at as the electrotonic state 1661 1662 was this related condition of statical electricity  1734 it may be said that the state of no lateral action is to static or inductive force the equivalent of magnetism to current force but that can only be upon the view that electric and magnetic action are in their nature essentially different 1664 if they are the same power the whole difference in the results being the consequence of the difference of direction then the normal or undeveloped state of electric force will correspond with the state of no lateral action of the magnetic state of the force the electric current will correspond with the lateral effects commonly called magnetism but the state of static induction which is between the normal condition and the current will still require a corresponding lateral condition in the magnetic series presenting its own peculiar phenomena for it can hardly be supposed that the normal electric and the inductive or polarized electric condition can both have the same lateral relation if magnetism be a separate and a higher relation of the powers developed then perhaps the argument which presses for this third condition of that force would not be so strong  1735 i cannot conclude these general remarks upon the relation of the electric and magnetic forces without expressing my surprise at the results obtained with the copper plate 1724 1725 the experiments with the flat helices represent one of the simplest cases of the induction of electrical currents 1720 the effect as is well known consisting in the production of a momentary current in a wire at the instant when a current in the contrary direction begins to pass through a neighbouring parallel wire and the production of an equally brief current in the reverse direction when the determining current is stopped 26 such being the case it seems very extraordinary that this induced current which takes place in the helix a when there is only air between a and c 1720 should be equally strong when that air is replaced by an enormous mass of that excellently conducting metal copper 1721 it might have been supposed that this mass would have allowed of the formation and discharge of almost any quantity of currents in it which the helix c was competent to induce and so in some degree have diminished if not altogether prevented the effect in a instead of which though we can hardly doubt that an infinity of currents are formed at the moment in the copper plate still not the smallest diminution or alteration of the effect in a appears 65 almost the only way of reconciling this effect with generally received notions is as it appears to me to admit that magnetic action is communicated by the action of the intervening particles 1729 1733  1736 this condition of things which is very remarkable accords perfectly with the effects observed in solid helices where wires are coiled over wires to the amount of five or six or more layers in succession no diminution of effect on the outer ones being occasioned by those within   § 22 note on electrical excitation   1737 that the different modes in which electrical excitement takes place will some day or other be reduced under one common law can hardly be doubted though for the present we are bound to admit distinctions it will be a great point gained when these distinctions are not removed but understood  1738 the strict relation of the electrical and chemical powers renders the chemical mode of excitement the most instructive of all and the case of two isolated combining particles is probably the simplest that we possess here however the action is local and we still want such a test of electricity as shall apply to it to cases of current electricity and also to those of static induction whenever by virtue of the previously combined condition of some of the acting particles 923 we are enabled as in the voltaic pile to expand or convert the local action into a current then chemical action can be traced through its variations to the production of all the phenomena of tension and the static state these being in every respect the same as if the electric forces producing them had been developed by friction  1739 it was berzelius i believe who first spoke of the aptness of certain particles to assume opposite states when in presence of each other 959 hypothetically we may suppose these states to increase in intensity by increased approximation or by heat c until at a certain point combination occurs accompanied by such an arrangement of the forces of the two particles between themselves as is equivalent to a discharge producing at the same time a particle which is throughout a conductor 1700  1740 this aptness to assume an excited electrical state which is probably polar in those forming nonconducting matter appears to be a primary fact and to partake of the nature of induction 1162 for the particles do not seem capable of retaining their particular state independently of each other 1177 or of matter in the opposite state what appears to be definite about the particles of matter is their assumption of a particular state as the positive or negative in relation to each other and not of either one or other indifferently and also the acquirement of force up to a certain amount  1741 it is easily conceivable that the same force which causes local action between two free particles shall produce current force if one of the particles is previously in combination forming part of an electrolyte 923 1738 thus a particle of zinc and one of oxygen when in presence of each other exert their inductive forces 1740 and these at last rise up to the point of combination if the oxygen be previously in union with hydrogen it is held so combined by an analogous exertion and arrangement of the forces and as the forces of the oxygen and hydrogen are for the time of combination mutually engaged and related so when the superior relation of the forces between the oxygen and zinc come into play the induction of the former or oxygen towards the metal cannot be brought on and increased without a corresponding deficiency in its induction towards the hydrogen with which it is in combination for the amount of force in a particle is considered as definite and the latter therefore has its force turned towards the oxygen of the next particle of water thus the effect may be considered as extended to sensible distances and thrown into the condition of static induction which being discharged and then removed by the action of other particles produces currents  1742 in the common voltaic battery the current is occasioned by the tendency of the zinc to take the oxygen of the water from the hydrogen the effective action being at the place where the oxygen leaves the previously existing electrolyte but schoenbein has arranged a battery in which the effective action is at the other extremity of this essential part of the arrangement namely where oxygen goes to the electrolytea the first may be considered as a case where the current is put into motion by the abstraction of oxygen from hydrogen the latter by that of hydrogen from oxygen the direction of the electric current is in both cases the same when referred to the direction in which the elementary particles of the electrolyte are moving 923 962 and both are equally in accordance with the hypothetical view of the inductive action of the particles just described 1740    a philosophical magazine 1838 xii 225 315 also de la rives   results with peroxide of manganese annales de chimie 1836 lxi p   40dec 1838  1743 in such a view of voltaic excitement the action of the particles may be divided into two parts that which occurs whilst the force in a particle of oxygen is rising towards a particle of zinc acting on it and falling towards the particle of hydrogen with which it is associated this being the progressive period of the inductive action and that which occurs when the change of association takes place and the particle of oxygen leaves the hydrogen and combines with the zinc the former appears to be that which produces the current or if there be no current produces the state of tension at the termination of the battery whilst the latter by terminating for the time the influence of the particles which have been active allows of others coming into play and so the effect of current is continued  1744 it seems highly probable that excitement by friction may very frequently be of the same character wollaston endeavoured to refer such excitement to chemical actiona but if by chemical action ultimate union of the acting particles is intended then there are plenty of cases which are opposed to such a view davy mentions some such and for my own part i feel no difficulty in admitting other means of electrical excitement than chemical action especially if by chemical action is meant a final combination of the particles    a philosophical transactions 1801 p 427  1745 davy refers experimentally to the opposite states which two particles having opposite chemical relations can assume when they are brought into the close vicinity of each other but not allowed to combinea this i think is the first part of the action already described 1743 but in my opinion it cannot give rise to a continuous current unless combination take place so as to allow other particles to act successively in the same manner and not even then unless one set of the particles be present as an element of an electrolyte 923 963 ie mere quiescent contact alone without chemical action does not in such cases produce a current    a philosophical transactions 1807 p 31  1746 still it seems very possible that such a relation may produce a high charge and thus give rise to excitement by friction when two bodies are rubbed together to produce electricity in the usual way one at least must be an insulator during the act of rubbing the particles of opposite kinds must be brought more or less closely together the few which are most favourably circumstanced being in such close contact as to be short only of that which is consequent upon chemical combination at such moments they may acquire by their mutual induction 1740 and partial discharge to each other very exalted opposite states and when the moment after they are by the progress of the rub removed from each others vicinity they will retain this state if both bodies be insulators and exhibit them upon their complete separation  1747 all the circumstances attending friction seem to me to favour such a view the irregularities of form and pressure will cause that the particles of the two rubbing surfaces will be at very variable distances only a few at once being in that very close relation which is probably necessary for the development of the forces further those which are nearest at one time will be further removed at another and others will become the nearest and so by continuing the friction many will in succession be excited finally the lateral direction of the separation in rubbing seems to me the best fitted to bring many pairs of particles first of all into that close vicinity necessary for their assuming the opposite states by relation to each other and then to remove them from each others influence whilst they retain that state  1748 it would be easy on the same view to explain hypothetically how if one of the rubbing bodies be a conductor as the amalgam of an electrical machine the state of the other when it comes from under the friction is as a mass exalted but it would be folly to go far into such speculation before that already advanced has been confirmed or corrected by fit experimental evidence i do not wish it to be supposed that i think all excitement by friction is of this kind on the contrary certain experiments lead me to believe that in many cases and perhaps in all effects of a thermoelectric nature conduce to the ultimate effect and there are very probably other causes of electric disturbance influential at the same time which we have not as yet
