74610344	an essay on man moral essays and satires   by alexander pope  cassell  company limited london paris  melbourne 1891     introduction   popes life as a writer falls into three periods answering fairly enough to the three reigns in which he worked  under queen anne he was an original poet but made little money by his verses under george i he was chiefly a translator and made much money by satisfying the french classical taste with versions of the iliad and odyssey  under george i he also edited shakespeare but with little profit to himself for shakespeare was but a philistine in the eyes of the frenchclassical critics  but as the eighteenth century grew slowly to its work signs of a deepening interest in the real issues of life distracted mens attention from the culture of the snuffbox and the fan  as popes genius ripened the best part of the world in which he worked was pressing forward as a mariner who will no longer hug the coast but crowds all sail to cross the storms of a wide unknown sea  popes poetry thus deepened with the course of time and the third period of his life which fell within the reign of george ii was that in which he produced the essay on man the moral essays and the satires  these deal wholly with aspects of human life and the great questions they raise according throughout with the doctrine of the poet and of the reasoning world about him in his latter day that the proper study of mankind is man  wrongs in high places and the private infamy of many who enforced the doctrines of the church had produced in earnest men a vigorous antagonism  tyranny and unreason of lowminded advocates had brought religion itself into question and profligacy of courtiers each worshipping the golden calf seen in his mirror had spread another form of scepticism  the intellectual scepticism based upon an honest search for truth could end only in making truth the surer by its questionings the other form of scepticism which might be traced in england from the lowminded frivolities of the court of charles the second was widely spread among the weak whose minds flinched from all earnest thought they swelled the number of the army of bold questioners upon the ways of god to man but they were an idle rout of campfollowers not combatants they simply ate and drank and died  in 1697 pierre bayle published at rotterdam his historical and critical dictionary in which the lives of men were associated with a comment that suggested from the ills of life the absence of divine care in the shaping of the world  doubt was born of the corruption of society nature and man were said to be against faith in the rule of a god wise just and merciful  in 1710 after bayles death leibnitz a german philosopher then resident in paris wrote in french a book with a title formed from greek words meaning justice of god theodicee in which he met bayles argument by reasoning that what we cannot understand confuses us because we see only the parts of a great whole  bayle he said is now in heaven and from his place by the throne of god he sees the harmony of the great universe and doubts no more  we see only a little part in which are many details that have purposes beyond our ken the argument of leibnitzs theodicee was widely used and although pope said that he had never read the theodicee his essay on man has a like argument  when any book has a wide influence upon opinion its general ideas pass into the minds of many people who have never read it  many now talk about evolution and natural selection who have never read a line of darwin  in the reign of george the second questionings did spread that went to the roots of all religious faith and many earnest minds were busying themselves with problems of the state of man and of the evidence of god in the life of man and in the course of nature  out of this came nearly at the same time two works wholly different in method and in toneso different that at first sight it may seem absurd to speak of them together  they were popes essay on man and butlers analogy of religion natural and revealed to the constitution and course of nature  butlers analogy was published in 1736 of the essay on man the first two epistles appeared in 1732 the third epistle in 1733 the fourth in 1734 and the closing universal hymn in 1738  it may seem even more absurd to name popes essay on man in the same breath with miltons paradise lost but to the best of his knowledge and power in his smaller way according to his nature and the questions of his time pope was like milton endeavouring to justify the ways of god to man he even borrowed miltons line for his own poem only weakening the verb and said that he sought to vindicate the ways of god to man  in miltons day the questioning all centred in the doctrine of the fall of man and questions of gods justice were associated with debate on fate foreknowledge and free will  in popes day the question was not theological but went to the root of all faith in existence of a god by declaring that the state of man and of the world about him met such faith with an absolute denial  popes argument good or bad had nothing to do with questions of theology  like butlers it sought for grounds of faith in the conditions on which doubt was rested  milton sought to set forth the story of the fall in such way as to show that god was love pope dealt with the question of god in nature and the world of man  popes argument was attacked with violence my m de crousaz professor of philosophy and mathematics in the university of lausanne and defended by warburton then chaplain to the prince of wales in six letters published in 1739 and a seventh in 1740 for which pope who died in 1744 was deeply grateful  his offence in the eyes of de crousaz was that he had left out of account all doctrines of orthodox theology  but if he had been orthodox of the orthodox his argument obviously could have been directed only to the form of doubt it sought to overcome  and when his closing hymn was condemned as the freethinkers hymn its censurers surely forgot that their arguments against it would equally apply to the lords prayer of which it is in some degree a paraphrase  the first design of the essay on man arranged it into four books each consisting of a distinct group of epistles  the first book in four epistles was to treat of man in the abstract and of his relation to the universe  that is the whole work as we have it now  the second book was to treat of man intellectual the third book of man social including ties to church and state the fourth book of man moral was to illustrate abstract truth by sketches of character  this part of the design is represented by the moral essays of which four were written to which was added as a fifth the epistle to addison which had been written much earlier in 1715 and first published in 1720  the four moral essays are two pairs  one pair is upon the characters of men and on the characters of women which would have formed the opening of the subject of the fourth book of the essay the other pair shows character expressed through a right or a wrong use of riches in fact money and morals  the four epistles were published separately  the fourth to the earl of burlington was first published in 1731 its title then being of taste the third to lord bathurst followed in 1732 the year of the publication of the first two epistles on the essay on man  in 1733 the year of publication of the third epistle of the essay on man pope published his moral essay of the characters of men  in 1734 followed the fourth epistle of the essay on man and in 1735 the characters of women addressed to martha blount the woman whom pope loved though he was withheld by a frail body from marriage  thus the two works were in fact produced together parts of one design  popes satires which still deal with characters of men followed immediately some appearing in a folio in january 1735  that part of the epistle to arbuthnot forming the prologue which gives a character of addison as atticus had been sketched more than twelve years before and earlier sketches of some smaller critics were introduced but the beginning and the end the parts in which pope spoke of himself and of his father and mother and his friend dr arbuthnot were written in 1733 and 1734  then follows an imitation of the first epistle of the second book of the satires of horace concerning which pope told a friend when i had a fever one winter in town that confined me to my room for five or six days lord bolingbroke who came to see me happened to take up a horace that lay on the table and turning it over dropped on the first satire in the second book which begins sunt quibus in satira  he observed how well that would suit my case if i were to imitate it in english  after he was gone i read it over translated it in a morning or two and sent it to press in a week or a fortnight after february 1733  and this was the occasion of my imitating some others of the satires and epistles  the two dialogues finally used as the epilogue to the satires were first published in the year 1738 with the name of the year seventeen hundred and thirtyeight  samuel johnsons london his first bid for recognition appeared in the same week and excited in pope not admiration only but some active endeavour to be useful to its author  the reader of pope as of every author is advised to begin by letting him say what he has to say in his own manner to an open mind that seeks only to receive the impressions which the writer wishes to convey  first let the mind and spirit of the writer come into free full contact with the mind and spirit of the reader whose attitude at the first reading should be simply receptive  such reading is the condition precedent to all true judgment of a writers work  all criticism that is not so grounded spreads as fog over a poets page  read reader for yourself without once pausing to remember what you have been told to think  hm     popes poems   an essay on man to h st john lord bolingbroke   the design   having proposed to write some pieces of human life and manners such as to use my lord bacons expression come home to mens business and bosoms i thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering man in the abstract his nature and his state since to prove any moral duty to enforce any moral precept or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in and what is the proper end and purpose of its being  the science of human nature is like all other sciences reduced to a few clear points there are not many certain truths in this world  it is therefore in the anatomy of the mind as in that of the body more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large open and perceptible parts than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation  the disputes are all upon these last and i will venture to say they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other and have diminished the practice more than advanced the theory of morality if i could flatter myself that this essay has any merit it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite in passing over terms utterly unintelligible and in forming a temperate yet not inconsistent and a short yet not imperfect system of ethics  this i might have done in prose but i chose verse and even rhyme for two reasons  the one will appear obvious that principles maxims or precepts so written both strike the reader more strongly at first and are more easily retained by him afterwards the other may seem odd but is true i found i could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself and nothing is more certain than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends on their conciseness  i was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail without becoming dry and tedious or more poetically without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament without wandering from the precision or breaking the chain of reasoning if any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them i freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity  what is now published is only to be considered as a general map of man marking out no more than the greater parts their extent their limits and their connection and leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow  consequently these epistles in their progress if i have health and leisure to make any progress will be less dry and more susceptible of poetical ornament  i am here only opening the fountains and clearing the passage  to deduce the rivers to follow them in their course and to observe their effects may be a task more agreeable  p   argument of epistle i   of the nature and state of man with respect to the universe  of man in the abstract  i that we can judge only with regard to our own system being ignorant of the relations of systems and things v17 etc ii that man is not to be deemed imperfect but a being suited to his place and rank in the creation agreeable to the general order of things and conformable to ends and relations to him unknown v35 etc  iii that it is partly upon his ignorance of future events and partly upon the hope of future state that all his happiness in the present depends v77 etc  iv the pride of aiming at more knowledge and pretending to more perfection the cause of mans error and misery  the impiety of putting himself in the place of god and judging of the fitness or unfitness perfection or imperfection justice or injustice of his dispensations v109 etc  v the absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause of the creation or expecting that perfection in the moral world which is not in the natural v131 etc  vi the unreasonableness of his complaints against providence while on the one hand he demands the perfections of the angels and on the other the bodily qualifications of the brutes though to possess any of the sensitive faculties in a higher degree would render him miserable v173 etc  vii that throughout the whole visible world an universal order and gradation in the sensual and mental faculties is observed which cause is a subordination of creature to creature and of all creatures to man  the gradations of sense instinct thought reflection reason that reason alone countervails all the other faculties v207  viii how much further this order and subordination of living creatures may extend above and below us were any part of which broken not that part only but the whole connected creation must be destroyed v233  ix  the extravagance madness and pride of such a desire v250  x the consequence of all the absolute submission due to providence both as to our present and future state v281 etc to the end   epistle i   awake my st john leave all meaner things to low ambition and the pride of kings let us since life can little more supply than just to look about us and to die expatiate free oer all this scene of man a mighty maze but not without a plan a wild where weeds and flowers promiscuous shoot or garden tempting with forbidden fruit together let us beat this ample field try what the open what the covert yield the latent tracts the giddy heights explore of all who blindly creep or sightless soar eye natures walks shoot folly as it flies and catch the manners living as they rise laugh where we must be candid where we can but vindicate the ways of god to man  i  say first of god above or man below what can we reason but from what we know of man what see we but his station here from which to reason or to which refer through worlds unnumbered though the god be known tis ours to trace him only in our own he who through vast immensity can pierce see worlds on worlds compose one universe observe how system into system runs what other planets circle other suns what varied being peoples every star may tell why heaven has made us as we are but of this frame the bearings and the ties the strong connections nice dependencies gradations just has thy pervading soul looked through or can a part contain the whole    is the great chain that draws all to agree and drawn supports upheld by god or thee  ii  presumptuous man the reason wouldst thou find why formed so weak so little and so blind first if thou canst the harder reason guess why formed no weaker blinder and no less ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made taller or stronger than the weeds they shade or ask of yonder argent fields above why joves satellites are less than jove    of systems possible if tis confest that wisdom infinite must form the best where all must full or not coherent be and all that rises rise in due degree then in the scale of reasoning life tis plain there must be somewhere such a rank as man and all the question wrangle eer so long is only this if god has placed him wrong    respecting man whatever wrong we call may must be right as relative to all in human works though laboured on with pain a thousand movements scarce one purpose gain in gods one single can its end produce yet serves to second too some other use so man who here seems principal alone perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown touches some wheel or verges to some goal tis but a part we see and not a whole    when the proud steed shall know why man restrains his fiery course or drives him oer the plains when the dull ox why now he breaks the clod is now a victim and now egypts god then shall mans pride and dulness comprehend his actions passions beings use and end why doing suffering checked impelled and why this hour a slave the next a deity    then say not mans imperfect heaven in fault say rather mans as perfect as he ought his knowledge measured to his state and place his time a moment and a point his space if to be perfect in a certain sphere what matter soon or late or here or there the blest today is as completely so as who began a thousand years ago  iii  heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate all but the page prescribed their present state from brutes what men from men what spirits know or who could suffer being here below the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed today had he thy reason would he skip and play pleased to the last he crops the flowery food and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood oh blindness to the future kindly given that each may fill the circle marked by heaven who sees with equal eye as god of all a hero perish or a sparrow fall atoms or systems into ruin hurled and now a bubble burst and now a world    hope humbly then with trembling pinions soar wait the great teacher death and god adore what future bliss he gives not thee to know but gives that hope to be thy blessing now hope springs eternal in the human breast man never is but always to be blest the soul uneasy and confined from home rests and expatiates in a life to come    lo the poor indian whose untutored mind sees god in clouds or hears him in the wind his soul proud science never taught to stray far as the solar walk or milky way yet simple nature to his hope has given behind the cloudtopped hill an humbler heaven some safer world in depth of woods embraced some happier island in the watery waste where slaves once more their native land behold no fiends torment no christians thirst for gold to be contents his natural desire he asks no angels wing no seraphs fire but thinks admitted to that equal sky his faithful dog shall bear him company  iv  go wiser thou and in thy scale of sense weigh thy opinion against providence call imperfection what thou fanciest such say here he gives too little there too much destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust yet cry if mans unhappy gods unjust if man alone engross not heavens high care alone made perfect here immortal there snatch from his hand the balance and the rod rejudge his justice be the god of god in pride in reasoning pride our error lies all quit their sphere and rush into the skies pride still is aiming at the blest abodes men would be angels angels would be gods aspiring to be gods if angels fell aspiring to be angels men rebel and who but wishes to invert the laws of order sins against the eternal cause  v  ask for what end the heavenly bodies shine earth for whose use  pride answers tis for mine for me kind nature wakes her genial power suckles each herb and spreads out every flower annual for me the grape the rose renew the juice nectareous and the balmy dew for me the mine a thousand treasures brings for me health gushes from a thousand springs seas roll to waft me suns to light me rise my footstool earth my canopy the skies    but errs not nature from this gracious end from burning suns when livid deaths descend when earthquakes swallow or when tempests sweep towns to one grave whole nations to the deep no tis replied the first almighty cause acts not by partial but by general laws the exceptions few some change since all began and what created perfectwhy then man if the great end be human happiness then nature deviates and can man do less as much that end a constant course requires of showers and sunshine as of mans desires as much eternal springs and cloudless skies as men for ever temperate calm and wise if plagues or earthquakes break not heavens design why then a borgia or a catiline who knows but he whose hand the lightning forms who heaves old ocean and who wings the storms pours fierce ambition in a caesars mind or turns young ammon loose to scourge mankind from pride from pride our very reasoning springs account for moral as for natural things why charge we heaven in those in these acquit in both to reason right is to submit    better for us perhaps it might appear were there all harmony all virtue here that never air or ocean felt the wind that never passion discomposed the mind but all subsists by elemental strife and passions are the elements of life the general order since the whole began is kept in nature and is kept in man  vi  what would this man  now upward will he soar and little less than angel would be more now looking downwards just as grieved appears to want the strength of bulls the fur of bears made for his use all creatures if he call say what their use had he the powers of all nature to these without profusion kind the proper organs proper powers assigned each seeming want compensated of course here with degrees of swiftness there of force all in exact proportion to the state nothing to add and nothing to abate each beast each insect happy in its own is heaven unkind to man and man alone shall he alone whom rational we call be pleased with nothing if not blessed with all    the bliss of man could pride that blessing find is not to act or think beyond mankind no powers of body or of soul to share but what his nature and his state can bear why has not man a microscopic eye for this plain reason man is not a fly say what the use were finer optics given to inspect a mite not comprehend the heaven or touch if tremblingly alive all oer to smart and agonize at every pore or quick effluvia darting through the brain die of a rose in aromatic pain if nature thundered in his opening ears and stunned him with the music of the spheres how would he wish that heaven had left him still the whispering zephyr and the purling rill who finds not providence all good and wise alike in what it gives and what denies  vii  far as creations ample range extends the scale of sensual mental powers ascends mark how it mounts to mans imperial race from the green myriads in the peopled grass what modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme the moles dim curtain and the lynxs beam of smell the headlong lioness between and hound sagacious on the tainted green of hearing from the life that fills the flood to that which warbles through the vernal wood the spiders touch how exquisitely fine feels at each thread and lives along the line in the nice bee what sense so subtly true from poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew how instinct varies in the grovelling swine compared halfreasoning elephant with thine twixt that and reason what a nice barrier for ever separate yet for ever near remembrance and reflection how allayed what thin partitions sense from thought divide and middle natures how they long to join yet never passed the insuperable line without this just gradation could they be subjected these to those or all to thee the powers of all subdued by thee alone is not thy reason all these powers in one  viii  see through this air this ocean and this earth all matter quick and bursting into birth above how high progressive life may go around how wide how deep extend below vast chain of being which from god began natures ethereal human angel man beast bird fish insect what no eye can see no glass can reach from infinite to thee from thee to nothing  on superior powers were we to press inferior might on ours or in the full creation leave a void where one step broken the great scales destroyed from natures chain whatever link you strike tenth or ten thousandth breaks the chain alike    and if each system in gradation roll alike essential to the amazing whole the least confusion but in one not all that system only but the whole must fall let earth unbalanced from her orbit fly planets and suns run lawless through the sky let ruling angels from their spheres be hurled being on being wrecked and world on world heavens whole foundations to their centre nod and nature tremble to the throne of god all this dread order breakfor whom for thee vile wormoh madness pride impiety  ix  what if the foot ordained the dust to tread or hand to toil aspired to be the head what if the head the eye or ear repined to serve mere engines to the ruling mind just as absurd for any part to claim to be another in this general frame just as absurd to mourn the tasks or pains the great directing mind of all ordains    all are but parts of one stupendous whole whose body nature is and god the soul that changed through all and yet in all the same great in the earth as in the ethereal frame warms in the sun refreshes in the breeze glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees lives through all life extends through all extent spreads undivided operates unspent breathes in our soul informs our mortal part as full as perfect in a hair as heart as full as perfect in vile man that mourns as the rapt seraph that adores and burns to him no high no low no great no small he fills he bounds connects and equals all  x  cease then nor order imperfection name our proper bliss depends on what we blame know thy own point this kind this due degree of blindness weakness heaven bestows on thee submit  in this or any other sphere secure to be as blest as thou canst bear safe in the hand of one disposing power or in the natal or the mortal hour all nature is but art unknown to thee all chance direction which thou canst not see all discord harmony not understood all partial evil universal good and spite of pride in erring reasons spite one truth is clear whatever is is right   argument of epistle ii   of the nature and state of man with respect to himself as an individual  i the business of man not to pry into god but to study himself  his middle nature his powers and frailties v1 to 19 the limits of his capacity v19 etc  ii the two principles of man selflove and reason both necessary v53 etc selflove the stronger and why v67 etc  their end the same v81 etc  iii the passions and their use v93 to 130  the predominant passion and its force v132 to 160  its necessity in directing men to different purposes v165 etc  its providential use in fixing our principle and ascertaining our virtue v177  iv virtue and vice joined in our mixed nature the limits near yet the things separate and evident what is the office of reason v202 to 216  v how odious vice in itself and how we deceive ourselves into it v217  vi that however the ends of providence and general good are answered in our passions and imperfections v238 etc  how usefully these are distributed to all orders of men v241  how useful they are to society v251  and to the individuals v263  in every state and every age of life v273 etc   epistle ii   i  know then thyself presume not god to scan the proper study of mankind is man placed on this isthmus of a middle state a being darkly wise and rudely great with too much knowledge for the sceptic side with too much weakness for the stoics pride he hangs between in doubt to act or rest in doubt to deem himself a god or beast in doubt his mind or body to prefer born but to die and reasoning but to err alike in ignorance his reason such whether he thinks too little or too much chaos of thought and passion all confused still by himself abused or disabused created half to rise and half to fall great lord of all things yet a prey to all sole judge of truth in endless error hurled the glory jest and riddle of the world    go wondrous creature mount where science guides go measure earth weigh air and state the tides instruct the planets in what orbs to run correct old time and regulate the sun go soar with plato to th empyreal sphere to the first good first perfect and first fair or tread the mazy round his followers trod and quitting sense call imitating god as eastern priests in giddy circles run and turn their heads to imitate the sun go teach eternal wisdom how to rule then drop into thyself and be a fool    superior beings when of late they saw a mortal man unfold all natures law admired such wisdom in an earthly shape and showed a newton as we show an ape    could he whose rules the rapid comet bind describe or fix one movement of his mind who saw its fires here rise and there descend explain his own beginning or his end alas what wonder mans superior part unchecked may rise and climb from art to art but when his own great work is but begun what reason weaves by passion is undone  trace science then with modesty thy guide first strip off all her equipage of pride deduct what is but vanity or dress or learnings luxury or idleness or tricks to show the stretch of human brain mere curious pleasure or ingenious pain expunge the whole or lop th excrescent parts of all our vices have created arts then see how little the remaining sum which served the past and must the times to come  ii  two principles in human nature reign selflove to urge and reason to restrain nor this a good nor that a bad we call each works its end to move or govern all and to their proper operation still ascribe all good to their improper ill  selflove the spring of motion acts the soul reasons comparing balance rules the whole man but for that no action could attend and but for this were active to no end fixed like a plant on his peculiar spot to draw nutrition propagate and rot or meteorlike flame lawless through the void destroying others by himself destroyed  most strength the moving principle requires active its task it prompts impels inspires sedate and quiet the comparing lies formed but to check deliberate and advise selflove still stronger as its objects nigh reasons at distance and in prospect lie that sees immediate good by present sense reason the future and the consequence thicker than arguments temptations throng at best more watchful this but that more strong the action of the stronger to suspend reason still use to reason still attend attention habit and experience gains each strengthens reason and selflove restrains  let subtle schoolmen teach these friends to fight more studious to divide than to unite and grace and virtue sense and reason split with all the rash dexterity of wit wits just like fools at war about a name have full as oft no meaning or the same selflove and reason to one end aspire pain their aversion pleasure their desire but greedy that its object would devour this taste the honey and not wound the flower pleasure or wrong or rightly understood our greatest evil or our greatest good  iii  modes of selflove the passions we may call tis real good or seeming moves them all but since not every good we can divide and reason bids us for our own provide passions though selfish if their means be fair list under reason and deserve her care those that imparted court a nobler aim exalt their kind and take some virtues name    in lazy apathy let stoics boast their virtue fixed tis fixed as in a frost contracted all retiring to the breast but strength of mind is exercise not rest the rising tempest puts in act the soul parts it may ravage but preserves the whole on lifes vast ocean diversely we sail reason the card but passion is the gale nor god alone in the still calm we find he mounts the storm and walks upon the wind    passions like elements though born to fight yet mixed and softened in his work unite these tis enough to temper and employ but what composes man can man destroy suffice that reason keep to natures road subject compound them follow her and god love hope and joy fair pleasures smiling train hate fear and grief the family of pain these mixed with art and to due bounds confined make and maintain the balance of the mind the lights and shades whose wellaccorded strife gives all the strength and colour of our life  pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes and when in act they cease in prospect rise present to grasp and future still to find the whole employ of body and of mind all spread their charms but charm not all alike on different senses different objects strike hence different passions more or less inflame as strong or weak the organs of the frame and hence once master passion in the breast like aarons serpent swallows up the rest    as man perhaps the moment of his breath receives the lurking principle of death the young disease that must subdue at length grows with his growth and strengthens with his strength so cast and mingled with his very frame the minds disease its ruling passion came each vital humour which should feed the whole soon flows to this in body and in soul whatever warms the heart or fills the head as the mind opens and its functions spread imagination plies her dangerous art and pours it all upon the peccant part    nature its mother habit is its nurse wit spirit faculties but make it worse reason itself but gives it edge and power as heavens blest beam turns vinegar more sour    we wretched subjects though to lawful sway in this weak queen some favourite still obey ah if she lend not arms as well as rules what can she more than tell us we are fools teach us to mourn our nature not to mend a sharp accuser but a helpless friend or from a judge turn pleader to persuade the choice we make or justify it made proud of an easy conquest all along she but removes weak passions for the strong so when small humours gather to a gout the doctor fancies he has driven them out    yes natures road must ever be preferred reason is here no guide but still a guard tis hers to rectify not overthrow and treat this passion more as friend than foe a mightier power the strong direction sends and several men impels to several ends like varying winds by other passions tossed this drives them constant to a certain coast let power or knowledge gold or glory please or oft more strong than all the love of ease through life tis followed even at lifes expense the merchants toil the sages indolence the monks humility the heros pride all all alike find reason on their side    the eternal art educing good from ill grafts on this passion our best principle tis thus the mercury of man is fixed strong grows the virtue with his nature mixed the dross cements what else were too refined and in one interest body acts with mind    as fruits ungrateful to the planters care on savage stocks inserted learn to bear the surest virtues thus from passions shoot wild natures vigour working at the root what crops of wit and honesty appear from spleen from obstinacy hate or fear see anger zeal and fortitude supply even avarice prudence sloth philosophy lust through some certain strainers well refined is gentle love and charms all womankind envy to which th ignoble minds a slave is emulation in the learned or brave nor virtue male or female can we name but what will grow on pride or grow on shame    thus nature gives us let it check our pride the virtue nearest to our vice allied reason the bias turns to good from ill and nero reigns a titus if he will the fiery soul abhorred in catiline in decius charms in curtius is divine the same ambition can destroy or save and makes a patriot as it makes a knave    this light and darkness in our chaos joined what shall divide  the god within the mind    extremes in nature equal ends produce in man they join to some mysterious use though each by turns the others bound invade as in some wellwrought picture light and shade and oft so mix the difference is too nice where ends the virtue or begins the vice    fools who from hence into the notion fall that vice or virtue there is none at all if white and black blend soften and unite a thousand ways is there no black or white ask your own heart and nothing is so plain tis to mistake them costs the time and pain    vice is a monster of so frightful mien as to be hated needs but to be seen yet seen too oft familiar with her face we first endure then pity then embrace but where th extreme of vice was neer agreed ask wheres the north at york tis on the tweed in scotland at the orcades and there at greenland zembla or the lord knows where no creature owns it in the first degree but thinks his neighbour farther gone than he even those who dwell beneath its very zone or never feel the rage or never own what happier nations shrink at with affright the hard inhabitant contends is right    virtuous and vicious every man must be few in th extreme but all in the degree the rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise and even the best by fits what they despise tis but by parts we follow good or ill for vice or virtue self directs it still each individual seeks a several goal but heavens great

descend what war could ravish commerce could bestow and he returned a friend who came a foe converse and love mankind might strongly draw when love was liberty and nature law thus states were formed the name of king unknown till common interest placed the sway in one twas virtue only or in arts or arms diffusing blessings or averting harms the same which in a sire the sons obeyed a prince the

tongue he from the wondering furrow called the food taught to command the fire control the flood draw forth the monsters of the abyss profound or fetch the aerial eagle to the ground till drooping sickening dying they began whom they revered as god to mourn as man then looking up from sire to sire explored one great first father and that first adored or plain tradition that this all begun conveyed unbroken faith from sire to son the worker from the work distinct was known and simple reason never sought but one ere wit oblique had broke that steady light man like his maker saw that all was right to virtue in the paths of pleasure trod and owned a father when he owned a god love all the faith and all the allegiance then for nature knew no right divine in men no ill could fear in god and understood a sovereign being but a sovereign good true faith true policy united ran this was but love of god and this of man    who first taught souls enslaved and realms undone the enormous faith of many made for one that proud exception to all natures laws to invert the world and counterwork its cause force first made conquest and that conquest law till superstition taught the tyrant awe then shared the tyranny then lent it aid and gods of conquerors slaves of subjects made she midst the lightnings blaze and thunders sound when rocked the mountains and when groaned the ground she taught the weak to bend the proud to pray to power unseen and mightier far than they she from the rending earth and bursting skies saw gods descend and fiends infernal rise here fixed the dreadful there the blest abodes fear made her devils and weak hope her gods gods partial changeful passionate unjust whose attributes were rage revenge or lust such as the souls of cowards might conceive and formed like tyrants tyrants would believe zeal then not charity became the guide and hell was built on spite and heaven on pride then sacred seemed the ethereal vault no more altars grew marble then and reeked with gore then first the flamen tasted living food next his grim idol smeared with human blood with heavens own thunders shook the world below and played the god an engine on his foe    so drives selflove through just and through unjust to one mans power ambition lucre lust the same selflove in all becomes the cause of what restrains him government and laws for what one likes if others like as well what serves one will when many wills rebel how shall he keep what sleeping or awake a weaker may surprise a stronger take his safety must his liberty restrain all join to guard what each desires to gain forced into virtue thus by selfdefence even kings learned justice and benevolence selflove forsook the path it first pursued and found the private in the public good    twas then the studious

supported lives the strength he gains is from the embrace he gives on their own axis as the planets run yet make at once their circle round the sun so two consistent motions act the soul and one

happiness  i false notions of happiness philosophical and popular answered from v19 to 77  ii it is the end of all men and attainable by all v30 god intends happiness to be equal and to be so it must be social since all particular happiness depends on general and since he governs by general not particular laws v37  as it is necessary for order and the peace and welfare of society that external goods should be unequal happiness is not made to consist in these v51  but notwithstanding that inequality the balance of happiness among mankind is kept even by providence by the two passions of hope and fear v70  iii what the happiness of individuals is as far as is consistent with the constitution of this world and that the good man has here the advantage v77  the error of imputing to virtue what are only the calamities of nature or of fortune v94  iv the folly of expecting that god should alter his general laws in favour of particulars v121  v that we are not judges who are good but that whoever they are they must be happiest v133 etc  vi that external goods are not the proper rewards but often inconsistent with or destructive of virtue v165 that even these can make no man happy without virtue instanced in riches v183  honours v191  nobility v203  greatness v215 fame v235  superior talents v257 etc  with pictures of human infelicity in men possessed of them all v267 etc  vii that virtue only constitutes a happiness whose object is universal and whose prospect eternal v307 etc  that the perfection of virtue and happiness consists in a conformity to the order of providence

extreme they dwell there needs but thinking right and meaning well and mourn our various portions as we please equal is common sense and common ease    remember man the universal cause acts not by

pleasures sicken and all glories sink each has his share and who would more obtain shall find the pleasure pays not half the pain    order is heavens first law and this confest some are and must be

rags one flutters in brocade the cobbler aproned and the parson gowned the friar hooded and the monarch crowned what differ more you cry than crown and cowl ill tell you friend a wise man and a fool youll find if once the monarch acts the monk or cobblerlike the parson will be drunk worth makes the man and want of it the fellow the rest is all but leather or prunella    stuck oer with titles and hung round with strings that thou mayest be by kings or whs of kings boast the pure blood of an illustrious race in quiet flow from lucrece to lucrece but by your fathers worth if yours you rate count me those only who were good and great go if your ancient but ignoble blood has crept through scoundrels ever since the flood go and pretend your family is young nor own your fathers have been fools so long what can ennoble sots or slaves or cowards alas not all the blood of all the howards    look next on greatness say where greatness lies where but among the heroes and the wise heroes are much the same the points agreed from macedonias madman to the swede the whole strange purpose of their lives to find or make an enemy of all mankind not one looks backward onward still he goes yet neer looks forward farther than his nose no less alike the politic and wise all sly slow things with circumspective eyes men in their loose unguarded hours they take not that themselves are wise but others weak but grant that those can conquer these can cheat tis phrase absurd to call a villain great who wickedly is wise or madly brave is but the more a fool the more a knave who noble ends by noble means obtains or failing smiles in exile or in chains like good aurelius let him reign or bleed like socrates that man is great indeed    whats fame a fancied life in others breath a thing beyond us even before our death just what you hear you have and whats unknown the same my lord if tullys or your own all that we feel of it begins and ends in the small circle of our foes or friends to all beside as much an empty shade an eugene living as a caesar dead alike or when or where they shone or shine or on the rubicon or on the rhine a wits a feather and a chief a rod an honest mans the noblest work of god fame but from death a villains name can save as justice tears his body from the grave when what the oblivion better were resigned is hung on high to poison half mankind all fame is foreign but of true desert plays round the head but comes not to the heart one selfapproving hour whole years outweighs of stupid starers and of loud huzzas and more true joy marcellus exiled feels than caesar with a senate at his heels    in parts superior what advantage lies tell for you can what is it to be wise tis but to know how little can be known to see all others faults and feel our own condemned in business or in arts to drudge without a second or without a judge truths would you teach or save a sinking land all fear none aid you and few understand painful preeminence yourself to view above lifes weakness and its comforts too    bring then these blessings to a strict account make fair deductions see to what they mount how much of other each is sure to cost how each for other oft is wholly lost how inconsistent greater goods with these how sometimes life is risked and always ease think and if still the things thy envy call say wouldst thou be the man to whom they fall to sigh for ribands if thou art so silly mark how they grace lord umbra or sir billy is yellow dirt the passion of thy life look but on gripus or on gripus wife if parts allure thee think how bacon shined the wisest brightest meanest of mankind or ravished with the whistling of a name see cromwell damned to everlasting fame if all united thy ambition call from ancient story learn to scorn them all there in the rich the honoured famed and great see the false scale of happiness complete in hearts of kings or arms of queens who lay how happy those to ruin these betray mark by what wretched steps their glory grows from dirt and seaweed as proud venice rose in each how guilt and greatness equal ran and all that raised the hero sunk the man now europes laurels on their brows behold but stained with blood or ill exchanged for gold then see them broke with toils or sunk with ease or infamous for plundered provinces oh wealth illfated which no act of fame eer taught to shine or sanctified from shame what greater bliss attends their close of life some greedy minion or imperious wife the trophied arches storeyed halls invade and haunt their slumbers in the pompous shade alas not dazzled with their noontide ray compute the morn and evening to the day the whole amount of that enormous fame a tale that blends their glory with their shame    know then this truth enough for man to know virtue alone is happiness below the only point where human bliss stands still and tastes the good without the fall to ill where only merit constant pay receives is blest in what it takes and what it gives the joy unequalled if its end it gain and if it lose attended with no pain without satiety though eer so blessed and but more relished as the more distressed the broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears less pleasing far than virtues very tears good from each object from each place acquired for ever exercised yet never tired never elated while one mans oppressed never dejected while anothers blessed and where no wants no wishes can remain since but to wish more virtue is to gain    see the sole bliss heaven could on all bestow which who but feels can taste but thinks can know yet poor with fortune and with learning blind the bad must miss the good untaught will find slave to no sect who takes no private road but looks through nature up to natures god pursues that chain which links the immense design joins heaven and earth and mortal and divine sees that no being any bliss can know but touches some above and some below learns from this union of the rising whole the first last purpose of the human soul and knows where faith law morals all began all end in love of god and love of man    for him alone hope leads from goal to goal and opens still and opens on his soul till lengthened on to faith and unconfined it pours the bliss that fills up all the mind he sees why nature plants in man alone hope of known bliss and faith in bliss unknown nature whose dictates to no other kind are given in vain but what they seek they find wise is her present she connects in this his greatest virtue with his greatest bliss at once his own bright prospect to be blest and strongest motive to assist the rest    selflove thus pushed to social to divine gives thee to make thy neighbours blessing thine is this too little for the boundless heart extend it let thy enemies have part grasp the whole worlds of reason life and sense in one close system of benevolence happier as kinder in whateer degree and height of bliss but height of charity    god loves from whole to parts but

experience singly v1  general maxims unless they be formed upon both will be but notional v10  some peculiarity in every man characteristic to himself yet varying from himself v15  difficulties arising from our own passions fancies faculties etc v31  the shortness of life to observe in and the uncertainty of the principles of action in men to observe by v37 etc  our own principle of action often hid from ourselves v41  some few characters plain but in general confounded dissembled or inconsistent v51  the same man utterly different in different places and seasons v71  unimaginable weaknesses in the greatest v70 etc  nothing constant and certain but god and nature v95  no judging of the motives from the actions the same actions proceeding from contrary motives and the same motives influencing contrary actions v100  ii yet to form characters we can only take the strongest actions of a mans life and try to make them agree the utter uncertainty of this from nature itself and from policy v120 characters given according to the rank of men of the world v135  and some reason for it v140  education alters the nature or at least character of many v149  actions passions opinions manners humours or principles all subject to change  no judging by nature from v158 to 178  iii it only remains to find if we can his ruling passion that will certainly influence all the rest and can reconcile the seeming or real inconsistency of all his actions v175  instanced in the extraordinary character of clodio v179  a caution against mistaking second qualities for first which will destroy all possibility of the knowledge of mankind v210  examples of the strength of the ruling passion and its continuation to the last breath v222 etc  yes you despise the man to books confined who from his study rails at human kind though what he learns he speaks and may advance some general maxims or be right by chance the coxcomb bird so talkative and grave that from his cage cries cd we and knave though many a passenger he rightly call you hold him no philosopher at all    and yet the fate of all extremes is such men may be read as well as books too much to observations which ourselves we make we grow more partial for the observers sake to written wisdom as anothers less maxims are drawn from notions those from guess theres some peculiar in each leaf and grain some unmarked fibre or some varying vein shall only man be taken in the gross grant but as many sorts of mind as moss    that each from other differs first confess next that he varies from himself no less add natures customs reasons passions strife and all opinions colours cast on life    our depths who fathoms or our shallows finds quick whirls and shifting eddies of our minds on human actions reason though you can it may be reason but it is not man his principle of action once explore that instant tis his principle no more like following life through creatures you dissect you lose it in the moment you detect    yet more the difference is as great between the optics seeing as the object seen all manners take a tincture from our own or come discoloured through our passions shown or fancys beam enlarges multiplies contracts inverts and gives ten thousand dyes    nor will lifes stream for observation stay it hurries all too fast to mark their way in vain sedate reflections we would make when half our knowledge we must snatch not take oft in the passions wild rotation tost our spring of action to ourselves is lost tired not determined to the last we yield and what comes then is master of the field as the last image of that troubled heap when sense subsides and fancy sports in sleep though past the recollection of the thought becomes the stuff of which our dream is wrought something as dim to our internal view is thus perhaps the cause of most we do    true some are open and to all men known others so very close theyre hid from none so darkness strikes the sense no less than light thus gracious chandos is beloved at sight and every child hates shylock though his soul still sits at squat and peeps not from its hole at half mankind when generous manly raves all know tis virtue for he thinks them knaves when universal homage umbra pays all see tis vice and itch of vulgar praise when flattery glares all hate it in a queen while one there is who charms us with his spleen    but these plain characters we rarely find though strong the bent yet quick the turns of mind or puzzling contraries confound the whole or affectations quite reverse the soul the dull flat falsehood serves for policy and in the cunning truth itselfs a lie unthoughtof frailties cheat us in the wise the fool lies hid in inconsistencies    see the same man in vigour in the gout alone in company in

embroils a state the same adust complexion has impelled charles to the convent philip to the field    not always actions show the man we find who does a kindness is not therefore kind perhaps

of riches  the vanity of expense in people of wealth and quality  the abuse of the word taste v13  that the first principle and foundation in this as in everything else is good sense v40   the chief proof of it is to follow nature even in works of mere luxury and elegance  instanced in architecture and gardening where all must be adapted to the genius and use of the place and the beauties not forced into it but resulting from it v50  how men are disappointed in their most expensive undertakings for want of this true foundation without which nothing can please long if at all and the best examples and rules will but be perverted into something burdensome or ridiculous v65 etc to 92  a description of the false taste of magnificence the first grand error of which is to imagine that greatness consists in the size and dimension instead of the proportion and harmony of the whole v97 and the second either in joining together parts incoherent or too minutely resembling or in the repetition of the same too frequently v105 etc  a word or two of false taste in books in music in painting even in preaching and prayer and lastly in entertainments v133 etc  yet providence is justified in giving wealth to be squandered in this manner since it is dispersed to the poor and laborious part of mankind v169 recurring to what is laid down in the first book ep ii and in the epistle preceding this v159 etc  what are the proper objects of magnificence and a proper field for the expense of great men v177 etc and finally the great and public works which become a prince v191 to the end  tis strange the miser should his cares employ to gain those riches he can neer enjoy is it less strange the prodigal should waste his wealth to purchase what he neer can taste not for

years since and drawn up by snatches as the several occasions offered  i had no thoughts of publishing it till it pleased some persons of rank and fortune the authors of verses to the imitator of horace and of an epistle to a doctor of divinity from a nobleman at hampton court to attack in a very extraordinary manner not only my writings of which being public the public is judge but my person morals and family whereof to those who know me not a truer information may be requisite being divided between the necessity to say something of myself and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task i thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this epistle  if it have anything pleasing it will be that by which i am most desirous to please the truth and the sentiment and if anything offensive it will be only to those i am least sorry to offend the vicious or the ungenerous  many will know their own pictures in it there being not a circumstance but what is true but i have for the most part spared their names and they may escape being laughed at if they please  i would have some of them know it was owing to the request of the learned and candid friend to whom it is inscribed that i make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine  however i shall have this advantage and honour on my side that whereas by their proceeding any abuse may be directed at any man no injury can possibly be done by mine since a nameless character can never be found out but by its truth and likenessp   epistle to dr arbuthnot being the prologue to the satires   p shut shut the door

sober critic come abroad if wrong i smiled if right i kissed the rod pains reading study are their just pretence and all they want is spirit taste and sense commas and points they set exactly right and twere a sin to rob them of their mite yet neer one sprig of laurel graced these ribalds from slashing bentley down to pg tibalds each wight who reads not and but scans and spells each wordcatcher that lives on syllables even such small critics some regard may claim preserved in miltons or in shakespeares name pretty in amber to observe the forms of hairs or straws or dirt or grubs or worms the things we know are neither rich nor rare but wonder how the devil they got there    were others angry i excused them too well might they rage i gave them but their due a mans true merit tis not hard to find but each mans secret standard in his mind that castingweight pride adds to emptiness this who can gratify for who can guess the bard whom pilfered pastorals renown who turns a persian tale for half a crown just writes to make his barrenness appear and strains from hardbound brains eight lines a year he who still wanting though he lives on theft steals much spends little yet has nothing left and he who now to sense now nonsense leaning means not but blunders round about a meaning and he whose fustians so sublimely bad it is not poetry but prose run mad all these my modest satire bade translate and owned that nine such poets made a tate how did they fume and stamp and roar and chafe and swear not addison himself was safe    peace to all such but were there one whose fires true genius kindles and fair fame inspires blessed with each talent and each art to please and born to write converse and live with ease should such a man too fond to rule alone bear like the turk no brother near the throne view him with scornful yet with jealous eyes and hate for arts that caused himself to rise damn with faint praise assent with civil leer and without sneering teach the rest to sneer willing to wound and yet afraid to strike just hint a fault and hesitate dislike alike reserved to blame or to commend a timorous foe and a suspicious friend dreading even fools by flatterers besieged and so obliging that he neer obliged like cato give his little senate laws and sit attentive to his own applause while wits and templars every sentence raise and wonder with a foolish face of praise who but must laugh if such a man there be who would not weep if atticus were he    what though my name stood rubric on the walls or plaistered posts with claps in capitals or smoking forth a hundred hawkers load on wings of winds came flying all abroad i sought no homage from the race that write i kept like asian monarchs from their sight poems i heeded now berhymed so long no more than thou great george a birthday song i neer with wits or witlings passed my days to spread about the itch of verse and praise nor like a puppy daggled through the town to fetch and carry singsong up and down nor at rehearsals sweat and mouthed and cried with handkerchief and orange at my side but sick of fops and poetry and prate to bufo left the whole castalian state    proud as apollo on his forked hill sat fullblown bufo puffed by every quill fed with soft dedication all day long horace and he went hand in hand in song his library where busts of poets dead and a true pindar stood without a head received of wits an undistinguished race who first his judgment asked and then a place much they extolled his pictures much his seat and flattered every day and some days eat till grown more frugal in his riper days he paid some bards with port and some with praise to some a dry rehearsal was assigned and others harder still he paid in kind dryden alone what wonder came not nigh dryden alone escaped this judging eye but still the great have kindness in reserve he helped to bury whom he helped to starve    may some choice patron bless each grey goose quill may every bavius have his bufo still so when a statesman wants a days defence or envy holds a whole weeks war with sense or simple pride for flattery makes demands may dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands blessed be the great for those they take away and those they left me for they left me gay left me to see neglected genius bloom neglected die and tell it on his tomb of all thy blameless life the soul return my verse and queensbury weeping oer thy urn    oh let me live my own and die so too to live and die is all i have to do maintain a poets dignity and ease and see what friends and read what books i please above a

raised on some of my epistles  an answer from horace was both more full and of more dignity than any i could have made in my own person and the example of much greater freedom in so eminent a divine as dr donne seemed a proof with what indignation and contempt a christian may treat vice or folly in ever so low or ever so high a station  both these authors were acceptable to the princes and ministers under whom they lived  the satires of dr donne i versified at the desire of the earl of oxford while he was lord treasurer and of the duke of shrewsbury who had been secretary of state neither of whom looked upon a satire on vicious courts as any reflection on those they served in  and indeed there is not in the world a greater error than that which fools are so apt to fall into and knaves with good reason to encourage the mistaking a satirist for a libeller whereas to a true satirist nothing is so odious as a libeller for the same reason as to a man truly virtuous nothing is so

first or better precepts if you can impart why do ill follow them with all my heart    the first epistle of the second book of horace   advertisement   the reflections of horace and the judgments past in his epistle to augustus seemed so seasonable to the present times that i could not help applying them to the use of my own country  the author thought them considerable enough to address them to his prince whom he paints with all the great and good qualities of a monarch upon whom the romans depended for the increase of an absolute empire  but to make the poem entirely english i was willing to add one or two of those which contribute to the happiness of a free people and are more consistent with the welfare of our neighbours  this epistle will show the learned world to have fallen into two mistakes one that augustus was a patron of poets in general whereas he not only prohibited all but the best writers to name him but recommended that care even to the civil magistrate admonebat praetores ne paterentur nomen suum obsolefieri etc  the other that this piece was only a general discourse of poetry whereas it was an apology for the poets in order to render augustus more their patron  horace here pleads the cause of his contemporaries first against the taste of the town whose humour it was to magnify the authors of the preceding age secondly against the court and nobility who encouraged only the writers for the theatre and lastly against the emperor himself who had conceived them of little use to the government  he shows by a view of the progress of learning and the change of taste among the romans that the introduction of the polite arts of greece had given the writers of his time great advantages over their predecessors that their morals were much improved and the licence of those ancient poets restrained that satire and comedy were become more just and useful that whatever extravagances were left on the stage were owing to the ill taste of the nobility that poets under due regulations were in many respects useful to the state and concludes that it was upon them the emperor himself must depend for his fame with posterity  we may farther learn from this epistle that horace made his court to this great prince by writing with a decent freedom toward him with a just contempt of his low flatterers and with a manly regard to his own character  p   epistle i  to augustus   while you great patron of mankind sustain the balanced world and open all the main your country chief in arms abroad defend at home with morals arts and laws amend how shall the muse from such a monarch steal an hour and not defraud the public weal    edward and henry now the boast of fame and virtuous alfred a more sacred name after a life of generous toils endured the gaul subdued or property secured ambition humbled mighty cities stormed our laws established and the world reformed closed their long glories with a sigh to find th unwilling gratitude of base mankind all human virtue to its latest breath finds envy never conquered but by death the great alcides every labour past had still this monster to subdue at last sure fate of all beneath whose rising ray each star of meaner merit fades away oppressed we feel the beam directly beat those suns of glory please not till they set    to thee the world its present homage pays the harvest early but mature the praise great friend of liberty in kings a name above all greek above all roman fame whose word is truth as sacred and revered as heavens own oracles from altars heard wonder of kings like whom to mortal eyes none eer has risen and none eer shall rise    just in one instance be it yet confest your people sir are partial in the rest foes to all living worth except your own and advocates for

admires why should not we be wiser than our sires in every public virtue we excel we build we paint we sing we dance as well and learned athens to our art must stoop could she behold us tumbling through a hoop    if time improve our wit as well as wine say at what age a poet grows divine shall we or shall we not account him so who died perhaps a hundred years ago end all dispute and fix the

as little seemed to heed the life to come in every poets creed who now reads cowley if he pleases yet his moral pleases not his pointed wit forget his epic nay pindaric art but still i love the language of his heart    yet surely surely these were famous men what boy but hears the sayings of old ben in all debates where critics bears a part not one but nods and talks of jonsons art of shakespeares nature and of cowleys wit how beaumonts judgment checked what fletcher writ how shadwell hasty wycherley was slow but for the passions southern sure and rowe these only these support the crowded stage from eldest heywood down to cibbers age    all this may be the peoples voice is odd it is and it is not the voice of god to gammer gurton if it give the bays and yet deny the careless husband praise or say our fathers never broke a rule why then i say the public is a fool but let them own that greater faults than we they had and greater virtues ill agree spenser himself affects the obsolete and sidneys verse halts ill on roman feet miltons strong pinion now not heaven can bound now serpentlike in prose he sweeps the ground in quibbles angel and archangel join and god the father turns a school divine not that id lop the beauties from his book like slashing bentley with his desperate hook or damn all shakespeare like the affected fool at court who hates whateer he read at

shines in the dry desert of a thousand lines or lengthened thought that gleams through many a page has sanctified whole poems for an age i lose my patience and i own it too when works are censured not as bad but new while if our elders break all reasons laws these fools demand not pardon but applause    on avons bank where flowers eternal blow if i but ask if any weed can grow one tragic sentence if i dare deride which bettertons grave action dignified or wellmouthed booth with emphasis proclaims though but perhaps a musterroll of names how will our fathers rise up in a rage and swear all shame is lost in georges age youd think no fools disgraced the former reign did not some grave examples yet remain who scorn a lad should teach his father skill and having once been wrong will be so still he who to seem more deep than you or i extols old bards or merlins prophecy mistake him not he envies not admires and to debase the sons exalts the sires had ancient times conspired to disallow what then was new what had been ancient now or what remained so worthy to be read by learned critics of the mighty dead    in days of ease when now the weary sword was sheathed and luxury with charles restored in every taste of foreign courts improved all by the kings example lived and loved then peers grew proud in horsemanship t excel newmarkets glory rose as britains fell the soldier breathed the gallantries of france and every flowery courtier wrote romance then marble softened into life grew warm and yielding metal flowed to human form lely on animated canvas stole the sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul no wonder then when all was love and sport the willing muses were debauched at court on each enervate string they taught the note to pant or tremble through an eunuchs throat    but britain changeful as a child at play now calls in princes and now turns away now whig now tory what we loved we hate now all for pleasure now for church and state now for prerogative and now for laws effects unhappy from a noble cause    time was a sober englishman would knock his servants up and rise by five oclock instruct his family in every rule and send his wife to church his son to school to worship like his fathers was his care to teach their frugal virtues to his heir to prove that luxury could never hold and place on good security his gold now times are changed and one poetic itch has seized the court and city poor and rich sons sires and grandsires all will wear the bays our wives read milton and our daughters plays to theatres and to rehearsals throng and all our grace at table is a song i who so oft renounce the muses lie not s self eer tells more fibs than i when sick of muse our follies we deplore and promise our best friends to rhyme no more we wake next morning in a raging fit and call for pen and ink to show our wit    he served a prenticeship who sets up shop ward tried on puppies and the poor his drop even radcliffs doctors travel first to france nor dare to practise till theyve learned to dance who builds a bridge that never drove a pile should ripley venture all the world would smile but those who cannot write and those who can all rhyme and scrawl and scribble to a man    yet sir reflect the mischief is not great these madmen never hurt the church or state sometimes the folly benefits mankind and rarely avrice taints the tuneful mind allow him but his plaything of a pen he neer rebels or plots like other men flight of cashiers or mobs hell never mind and knows no losses while the muse is kind to cheat a friend or ward he leaves to peter the good man heaps up nothing but mere metre enjoys his garden and his book in quiet and thena perfect hermit in his diet    of little use the man you may suppose who says in verse what others say in prose yet let me show a poets of some weight and though no soldier useful to the state what will a child learn sooner than a song what better teach a foreigner the tongue whats long or short each accent where to place and speak in public with some sort of grace i scarce can think him such a worthless thing unless he praise some monster of a king or virtue or religion turn to sport to please a lewd or unbelieving court unhappy drydenin all charless days roscommon only boasts unspotted bays and in our own excuse some courtly stains no whiter page than addison remains he from the taste obscene reclaims our youth and sets the passions on the side of truth forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art and pours each human virtue in the heart let ireland tell how wit upheld her cause her trade supported and supplied her laws and leave on swift this grateful verse engraved the rights a court attacked a poet saved behold the hand that wrought a nations cure stretched to relieve the idiot and the poor proud vice to brand or injured worth adorn and stretch the ray to ages yet unborn not but there are who merit other palms hopkins and sternhold glad the heart with psalms the boys and girls whom charity maintains implore your help in these pathetic strains how could devotion touch the country pews unless the gods bestowed a proper muse verse cheers their leisure verse assists their work verse prays for peace or sings down pope and turk the silenced preacher yields to potent strain and feels that grace his prayer besought in vain the blessing thrills through all the labring throng and heaven is won by violence of song    our rural ancestors with little blest patient of labour when the end was rest indulged the day that housed their annual grain with feasts and offrings and a thankful strain the joy their wives their sons and servants share ease of their toil and partners of their care the laugh the jest attendants on the bowl smoothed every brow and opened every soul with growing years the pleasing licence grew and taunts alternate innocently flew but times corrupt and nature illinclined produced the point that left a sting behind till friend with friend and families at strife triumphant malice raged through private life who felt the wrong or feared it took th alarm appealed to law and justice lent her arm at length by wholesome dread of statutes bound the poets learned to please and not to wound most warped to flattrys side but some more nice preserved the freedom and forebore the vice hence satire rose that just the medium hit and heals with morals what it hurts with wit    we conquered france but felt our captives charms her arts victorious triumphed oer our arms britain to soft refinements less a foe wit grew polite and numbers learned to flow waller was smooth but dryden taught to join  the varying verse the fullresounding line  the long majestic march and energy divine  though still some traces of our rustic vein and splayfoot verse remained and will remain late very late correctness grew our care when the tired nation breathed from civil war exact racine and corneilles noble fire showed us that france had something to admire not but the tragic spirit was our own and full in shakespeare fair in otway shone but otway failed to polish or refine and fluent shakespeare scarce effaced a line een copious dryden wanted or forgot the last and greatest art the art to blot some doubt if equal pains or equal fire the humbler muse of comedy require but in known images of life i guess the labour greater as th indulgence less observe how seldom even the best succeed tell me if congreves fools are fools indeed what pert low dialogue has farquhar writ how van wants grace who never wanted wit the stage how loosely does astraea tread who fairly puts all characters to bed and idle cibber how he breaks the laws to make poor pinky eat with vast applause but fill their purse our poets work is done alike to them by pathos or by pun    o you whom vanitys light bark conveys on fames mad voyage by the wind of praise with what a shifting gale your course you ply for ever sunk too low or borne too high who pants for glory finds but short repose a breath revives him or a breath oerthrows farewell the stage if just as thrives the play the silly bard grows fat or falls away    there still remains to mortify a wit the manyheaded monster of the pit a senseless worthless and unhonoured crowd who to disturb their betters mighty proud clattring their sticks before ten lines are spoke call for the farce the bear or the blackjoke what dear delight to britons farce affords ever the taste of mobs but now of lords taste that eternal wanderer which flies from heads to ears and now from ears to eyes the play stands still damn action and discourse back fly the scenes and enter foot and horse pageants on pageants in long order drawn peers heralds bishops ermine gold and lawn the champion too and to complete the jest old edwards armour beams on cibbers breast with laughter sure democritus had died had he beheld an audience gape so wide let bear or elephant be eer so white the people sure the people are the sight ah luckless poet stretch thy lungs and roar that bear or elephant shall heed thee more while all its throats the gallery extends and all the thunder of the pit ascends loud as the wolves on orcas stormy steep howl to the roarings of the northern deep such is the shout the longapplauding note at quins high plume or oldfields petticoat or when from court a birthday suit bestowed sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load booth entershark the universal peal but has he spoken  not a syllable what shook the stage and made the people stare catos long wig flowered gown and lacquered chair    yet lest you think i rally more than teach or praise malignly arts i cannot reach let me for once presume t instruct the times to know the poet from the man of rhymes tis he who gives my breast a thousand pains can make me feel each passion that he feigns enrage compose with more than magic art with pity and with terror tear my heart and snatch me oer the earth or through the air to thebes to athens when he will and where    but not this part of the poetic state alone deserves the favour of the great think of those authors sir who would rely more on a readers sense than gazers eye or who shall wander where the muses sing who climb their mountain or who taste their spring how shall we fill a library with wit when merlins cave is half unfurnished yet    my liege why writers little claim your thought i guess and with their leave will tell the fault we poets are upon a poets word of all mankind the creatures most absurd the season when to come and when to go to sing or cease to sing we never know and if we will recite nine hours in ten you lose your patience just like other men then too we hurt ourselves when to defend a single verse we quarrel with a friend repeat unasked lament the wits too fine for vulgar eyes and point out every line but most when straining with too weak a wing we needs will write epistles to the king and from the moment we oblige the town expect a place or pension from the crown or dubbed historians by express command t enrol your triumphs oer the seas and land be called to court to plan some work divine as once for louis boileau and racine    yet think great sir so many virtues shown ah think what poet best may make them known or choose at least some minister of grace fit to bestow the laureates weighty place    charles to late times to be transmitted fair assigned his figure to berninis care and great nassau to knellers hand decreed to fix him graceful on the bounding steed so well in paint and stone they judged of merit but kings in wit may want discerning spirit the hero william and the martyr charles one knighted blackmore and one pensioned quarles which made old ben and surly dennis swear no lords anointed but a russian bear    not with such majesty such bold relief the forms august of king or conquering chief eer swelled on marble as in verse have shined in polished verse the manners and the mind oh could i mount on the maeonian wing your arms your actions your repose to sing what seas you traversed and what fields you fought your countrys peace how oft how dearly bought how barbrous rage subsided at your word and nations wondered while they dropped the sword how when you nodded oer the land and deep peace stole her wing and wrapped the world in sleep till earths extremes your mediation own and asias tyrants tremble at your throne but verse alas your majesty disdains and im not used to panegyric strains the zeal of fools offends at any time but most of all the zeal of fools in rhyme besides a fate attends on all i write that when i aim at praise they say i bite a vile encomium doubly ridicules theres nothing blackens like the ink of fools if true a woeful likeness and if lies praise undeserved is scandal in disguise well may he blush who gives it or receives and when i flatter let my dirty leaves like journals odes and such forgotten things as eusden philips settle writ of kings clothe spice line trunks or fluttring in a row befringe the rails of bedlam and soho    the second epistle of the second book of horace      ludentis speciem dabit et torquebitur  hor v124  dear colonel cobhams and your countrys friend you love a verse take such as i can send a frenchman comes presents you with his boy bows and beginsthis lad sir is of blois observe his shape how clean his locks how curled my only son id have him see the world his french is pure his voice tooyou shall hear sir hes your slave for twenty pound a year mere wax as yet you fashion him with ease your barber cook upholsterer what you please a perfect genius at an opera song to say too much might do my honour wrong take him with all his virtues on my word his whole ambition was to serve a lord but sir to you with what would i not part though faith i fear twill break his mothers heart once and but once i caught him in a lie and then unwhipped he had the grace to cry the fault he has i fairly shall reveal could you oerlook but that it is to steal    if after this you took the graceless lad could you complain my friend he proved so bad faith in such case if you should prosecute i think sir godfrey should decide the suit who sent the thief that stole the cash away and punished him that put it in his way    consider then and judge me in this light i told you when i went i could not write you said the same and are you discontent with laws to which you gave your own assent nay worse to ask for verse at such a time dye think me good for nothing but to rhyme    in annas wars a soldier poor and old had dearly earned a little purse of gold tired with a tedious march one luckless night he slept poor dog and lost it to a doit this put the man in such a desperate mind  between revenge and grief and hunger joined  against the foe himself and all mankind  he leaped the trenches scaled a castle wall tore down a standard took the fort and all prodigious well his great commander cried gave him much praise and some reward beside next pleased his excellence a town to batter its name i know not and its no great matter go on my friend he cried see yonder walls advance and conquer go where glory calls more honours more rewards attend the brave dont you remember what reply he gave dye think me noble general such a sot let him take castles who has neer a groat    bred up at home full early i begun to read in greek the wrath of peleus son besides my father taught me from a lad the better art to know the good from bad and little sure imported to remove to hunt for truth in maudlins learned grove but knottier points we knew not half so well deprived us soon of our paternal cell and certain laws by sufferers thought unjust denied all posts of profit or of trust hopes after hopes of pious papists failed while mighty williams thundering arm prevailed for right hereditary taxed and fined he stuck to poverty with peace of mind and me the muses helped to undergo it convict a papist he and i a poet but thanks to homer since i live and thrive indebted to no prince or peer alive sure i should want the care of ten monroes if i would scribble rather than repose years following years steal something every day at last they steal us from ourselves away in one our frolics one amusements end in one a mistress drops in one a friend this subtle thief of life this paltry time what will it leave me if it snatch my rhyme if every wheel of that unwearied mill that turned ten thousand verses now stands still    but after all what would you have me do when out of twenty i can please not two when this heroics only deigns to praise sharp satire that and that pindaric lays one likes the pheasants wing and one the leg the vulgar boil the learned roast an egg hard task to hit the palate of such guests when oldfield loves what dartineuf detests    but grant i may relapse for want of grace again to rhyme can london be the place who there his muse or self or soul attends in crowds and courts law business feasts and friends my counsel sends to execute a deed a poet begs me i will hear him read in palace yard at nine youll find me there at ten for certain sir in bloomsbury square before the lords at twelve my cause comes on theres a rehearsal sir exact at one oh but a wit can study in the streets and raise his mind above the mob he meets not quite so well however as one ought a hackney coach may chance to spoil a thought and then a nodding beam or pig of lead god knows may hurt the very ablest head have you not seen at guildhalls narrow pass two aldermen dispute it with an ass and peers give way exalted as they are even to their own srvance in a car    go lofty poet and in such a crowd sing thy sonorous versebut not aloud alas to grottoes and to groves we run to ease and silence every muses son blackmore himself for any grand effort would drink and doze at tooting or earls court how shall i rhyme in this eternal roar how match the bards whom none eer matched before the man who stretched in isis calm retreat to books and study gives seven years complete see strewed with learned dust his nightcap on he walks an object new beneath the sun the boys flock round him and the people stare  so stiff so mute some statue you would swear  stepped from its pedestal to take the air  and here while town and court and city roars with mobs and duns and soldiers at their doors shall i in london act this idle part composing songs for fools to get by heart the temple late two brother sergeants saw who deemed each other oracles of law with equal talents these congenial souls one lulled th exchequer and one stunned the rolls each had a gravity would make you split and shook his head at murray as a wit twas sir your lawand sir your eloquence yours cowpers mannerand yours talbots sense thus we dispose of all poetic merit yours miltons genius and mine homers spirit call tibbald shakespeare and hell swear the nine dear cibber never matched one ode of thine lord how we strut through merlins cave to see no poets there but stephen you and me walk with respect behind while we at ease weave laurel crowns and take what names we please my dear tibullus if that will not do let me be horace and be ovid you or im content allow me drydens strains and you shall rise up otway for your pains much do i suffer much to keep in peace this jealous waspish wronghead rhyming race and much must flatter if the whim should bite to court applause by printing what i write but let the fit pass oer im wise enough to stop my ears to their confounded stuff    in vain bad rhymers all mankind reject they treat themselves with most profound respect tis to small purpose that you hold your tongue each praised within is happy all day long but how severely with themselves proceed the men who write such verse as we can read their own strict judges not a word they spare that wants or force or light or weight or care howeer unwillingly it quits its place nay though at court perhaps it may find grace such theyll degrade and sometimes in its stead in downright charity revive the dead mark where a bold expressive phrase appears bright through the rubbish of some hundred years command old words that long have slept to wake words that wise bacon or brave raleigh spake or bid the new be english ages hence for use will farther whats begot by sense pour the full tide of eloquence along  serenely pure and yet divinely strong  rich with the treasures of each foreign tongue  prune the luxuriant the uncouth refine but show no mercy to an empty line then polish all with so much life and ease you think tis nature and a knack to please but ease in writing flows from art not chance as those move easiest who have learned to dance    if such the plague and pains to write by rule better say i be pleased and play the fool call if you will bad rhyming a disease it gives men happiness or leaves them ease there lived in primo georgii they record a worthy member no small

or late there is a time when poets will grow dull ill een leave verses to the boys at school to rules of poetry no more confined i learn to smooth and harmonise my mind teach every thought within its bounds to roll and keep the equal measure of the soul    soon as i enter at my country door my mind resumes the thread it dropt before thoughts which at hyde park corner i forgot meet and rejoin me in the pensive grot there all alone and compliments apart i ask these sober questions of my heart    if when the more you drink the more you crave you tell the doctor when the more you have the more you want why not with equal ease confess as well your folly as disease the heart resolves this matter in a thrice men only feel the smart but not the vice    when golden angels cease to cure the evil you give all royal witchcraft to the devil when servile chaplains cry that birth and place endure a peer with honour truth and grace look in that breast most dirty d be fair say can you find out one such lodger there yet still not heeding what your heart can teach you go to church to hear these flatterers preach    indeed could wealth bestow or wit or merit a grain of courage or a spark of spirit the

a linguist half so good i make no question but the tower had stood obliging sir for courts you sure were made why then for ever buried in the shade spirits like you should see and should be seen the king would smile on youat least the queen ah gentle sir you courtiers so cajole us but tully has it nunquam minus solus and as for courts forgive me if i say no lessons now are taught the spartan way though in his pictures lust be full displayed few are the converts aretine has made and though the court show vice exceeding clear none should by my advice learn virtue there    at this entranced he lifts his hands and eyes squeaks like a highstretched lutestring and replies oh tis the sweetest of all earthly things to gaze on princes and to talk of kings then happy man who shows the tombs said i he dwells amidst the royal family he every day from king to king can walk of all our harries all our edwards talk and get by speaking truth of monarchs dead what few can of the living ease and bread

coarse iron sharpened mangles more and itch most hurts when angered to a sore so when you plague a fool tis still the curse you only make the matter worse and worse    he past it oer affects an easy smile at all my peevishness and turns his style he asks what news  i tell him of new plays new eunuchs harlequins and operas he hears and as a still with simples in it between each drop it gives stays half a minute loth to enrich me with too quick replies by little and by little drops his lies mere household trash of birthnights balls and shows more than ten holinsheds or halls or stowes when the queen frowned or smiled he knows and what a subtle minister may make of that who sins with whom who got his pension rug or quickened a reversion by a drug whose place is quartered out three parts in four and whether to a bishop or a we who having lost his credit pawned his rent is therefore fit to have a government who in the secret deals in stocks secure and cheats the unknowing widow and the poor who makes a trust or charity a job and gets an act of parliament to rob why turnpikes rise and now no cit nor clown can gratis see the country or the town shortly no lad shall chuck or lady vole but some excising courtier will have toll he tells what strumpet places sells for life what squire his lands what citizen his wife and last which proves him wiser still than all what ladys face is not

big wife at sight of loathsome meat ready to cast i yawn i sigh and sweat then as a licensed spy whom nothing can silence or hurt he libels the great man swears every place entailed for years to come in sure succession to the day of doom he names the price for every office paid and says our wars thrive ill because delayed nay hints tis by connivance of the court that spain robs on and dunkirks still a port not more amazement seized on circes guests to see themselves fall endlong into beasts than mine to find a subject staid and wise already half turned traitor by surprise i felt the infection slide from him to me as in the  some give it to get free and quick to swallow me methought i saw one of our giant statutes ope its jaw    in that nice moment as another lie stood just atilt the minister came by to him he flies and bows and bows again then close as umbra joins the dirty train not fannius self more impudently near when half his nose is in his princes ear i quaked at heart and still afraid to see all the court filled with stranger things than he ran out as fast as one that pays his bail and dreads more actions hurries from a jail    bear me some god oh quickly bear me hence to wholesome solitude the nurse of sense where contemplation plumes her ruffled wings and the free soul looks down to pity kings there sober thought pursued the amusing theme till fancy coloured it and formed a dream a vision hermits can to hell transport and forced even me to see the damned at court not dante dreaming all the infernal state beheld such scenes of envy sin and hate base fear becomes the guilty not the free suits tyrants plunderers but suits not me shall i the terror of this sinful town care if a liveried lord or smile or frown who cannot flatter and detest who can tremble before a noble servingman o my fair mistress truth shall i quit thee for huffing braggart puffed nobility thou who since yesterday hast rolled oer all the busy idle blockheads of the ball hast thou oh sun beheld an emptier fort than such who swell this bladder of a court now plague on those who show a court in wax it ought to bring all courtiers on their backs such painted puppets such a varnished race of hollow gewgaws only dress and face such waxen noses stately staring things no wonder some folks bow and think them kings    see where the british youth engaged no more at figs at whites with felons or a bore pay their last duty to the court and come all fresh and fragrant to the drawingroom in hues as gay and odours as divine as the fair fields they sold to look so fine thats velvet for a king the flatterer swears tis true for ten days hence twill be king lears our court may justly to our stage give rules that helps it both to foolscoats and to fools and why not players strut in courtiers clothes for these are actors too as well as those wants reach all states they beg but better drest and all is splended poverty at best painted for sight and essenced for the smell like

dear countess you have charms all hearts to hit and sweet sir fopling you have so much wit such wits and beauties are not praised for nought for both the beauty and the wit are bought twould burst even heraclitus with the spleen to see those antics fopling and courtin the presence seems with things so richly odd the mosque of mahound or some queer pagod see them survey their limbs by durers rules of all beaukind the best proportioned fools adjust their clothes and to confession draw those venial sins an atom or a straw but oh what terrors must distract the soul convicted of that mortal crime a hole or should one pound of powder less bespread those monkey tails that wag behind their head thus finished and corrected to a hair they march to prate their hour before the fair so first to

i sweat i fly and shake all oer like a discovered spy    courts are too much for wits so weak as mine charge them with heavens artillery bold divine from such alone the great rebukes endure whose satires sacred and whose rage secure    tis mine to wash a few light stains but theirs to deluge sin and drown a court in tears however whats now apocrypha my wit in time to come may pass for holy writ    epilogue to the satires in two dialogues written in mdccxxxviii   dialogue i      fr not twice a twelvemonth you appear in print and when it comes the court see nothing int you grow correct that once with rapture writ and are besides too moral for a wit decay of parts alas we all must feel why now this moment dont i see you steal tis all from horace horace long before ye said tories called him whig and whigs a tory and taught his romans in much better metre to laugh at fools who put their trust in peter    but horace sir was delicate was nice bubo observes he lashed no sort of vice horace would say sir billy served the crown blunt could do business hggins knew the town in sappho touch the failings of the sex in reverend bishops note some small neglects and own the spaniard did a waggish thing who cropped our ears and sent them to the king his sly polite insinuating style could please at court and make augustus smile an artful manager that crept between his friend and shame and was a kind of screen but faith your friends will soon be sore patriots there are who wish youd jest no more and wheres the glory twill be only thought the great man never offered you a groat go see sir robertp see sir roberthum and never laughfor all my life to come seen him i have but in his happier hour of social pleasure illexchanged for power seen him unencumbered with the venal tribe

laugh out    f why yes with scripture still you may be free a horselaugh if you please at honesty a joke on jekyl or some odd old whig who never changed his principle or wig a patriot is a fool in every age whom all lord chamberlains allow the stage these nothing hurts they keep their fashion still and wear their strange old virtue as they will if any ask you whos the man so near his prince that writes in verse and has his ear why answer lyttelton and ill engage the worthy youth shall neer be in a rage but were his verses vile his whisper base youd quickly find him in lord fannys case sejanus wolsey hurt not honest fleury but well may put some statesmen in a fury    laugh then at any but at fools or foes these you but anger and you mend not those laugh at your friends and if your friends are sore so much the better you may laugh the more to vice and folly to confine the jest sets half the world god knows against the rest did not the sneer of more impartial men at sense and virtue balance all again judicious wits spread wide the ridicule and charitably comfort knave and fool    p dear sir forgive the prejudice of youth adieu distinction satire warmth and truth come harmless characters that no one hit come henleys oratory osbornes wit the honey dropping from favonios tongue the flowers of bubo and the flow of yng the gracious dew of pulpit eloquence and all the wellwhipped cream of courtly sense that first was hvys fs next and then the stes and then hvys once again o come that easy ciceronian style so latin yet so english all the while as though the pride of middleton and bland all boys may read and girls may understand then might i sing without the least offence and all i sung should be the nations sense or teach the melancholy muse to mourn hang the sad verse on carolinas urn and hail her passage to the realms of rest all parts performed and all her children blessed sosatire is no morei feel it die no gazetteer more innocent than i and let a gods name every fool and knave be graced through life and flattered in his grave    f why so if satire knows its time and place you still may lash the greatestin disgrace for merit will by turns forsake them all would you know when exactly when they fall but let all satire in all changes spare immortal sk and grave dere silent and soft as saints remove to heaven all ties dissolved and every sin forgiven these may some gentle ministerial wing receive and place for ever near a king there where no passion pride or shame transport lulled with the sweet nepenthe of a court there where no fathers

throb save when they lose a question or a job    p good heaven forbid that i should blast their glory who know how like whig ministers to tory and when three sovereigns died could scarce be vexed considering what a gracious prince was next have i in silent wonder seen such things as pride in slaves and avarice in kings and at a peer or peeress shall i fret who starves a sister or forswears a
