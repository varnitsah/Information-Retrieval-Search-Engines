91747951	the redheaded outfield and other baseball stories   by  zane grey    contents    the redheaded outfield   the rube   the rubes pennant   the rubes honeymoon   the rubes waterloo   breaking into fast company   the knocker   the winning ball   false colors   the manager of maddens hill   old wellwell     the redheaded outfield and other baseball stories    there was delaneys redhaired triored gilbat left fielder reddy clammer right fielder and reddie ray center fielder composing the most remarkable outfield ever developed in minor league baseball  it was delaneys pride as it was also his trouble  red gilbat was nuttyand his batting average was 371  any student of baseball could weigh these two facts against each other and understand something of delaneys trouble  it was not possible to camp on red gilbats trail  the man was a jackolantern a willothewisp a weird longlegged longarmed redhaired illusive phantom when the gong rang at the ball grounds there were ten chances to one that red would not be present  he had been discovered with small boys peeping through knotholes at the vacant left field he was supposed to inhabit during play  of course what red did off the ball grounds was not so important as what he did on  and there was absolutely no telling what under the sun he might do then except once out of every three times at bat he could be counted on to knock the cover off the ball  reddy clammer was a grandstand playerthe kind all managers hatedand he was hitting 305 he made circus catches circus stops circus throws circus stealsbut particularly circus catches  that is to say he made easy plays appear difficult  he was always strutting posing talking arguing quarrelingwhen he was not engaged in making a grandstand play  reddy clammer used every possible incident and artifice to bring himself into the limelight  reddie ray had been the intercollegiate champion in the sprints and a famous college ball player  after a few months of professional ball he was hitting over 400 and leading the league both at bat and on the bases  it was a beautiful and a thrilling sight to see him run  he was so quick to start so marvelously swift so keen of judgment that neither delaney nor any player could ever tell the hit that he was not going to get  that was why reddie ray was a whole game in himself  delaneys rochester stars and the providence grays were tied for first place  of the present series each team had won a game  rivalry had always been keen and as the teams were about to enter the long homestretch for the pennant there was battle in the new england air  the september day was perfect  the stands were half full and the bleachers packed with a whitesleeved mass  and the field was beautifully level and green  the grays were practicing and the stars were on their bench  were up against it delaney was saying this new umpire fuller hasnt got it in for us oh no not at all  believe me hes a robber but scott is pitchin well  won his last three games  hell bother em  and the three reds have broken loose  theyre on the rampage theyll burn up this place today  somebody noted the absence of gilbat  delaney gave a sudden start  why gil was here he said slowly lordhes about due for a nutty stunt  whereupon delaney sent boys and players scurrying about to find gilbat and delaney went himself to ask the providence manager to hold back the gong for a few minutes  presently somebody brought delaney a telephone message that red gilbat was playing ball with some boys in a lot four blocks down the street when at length a couple of players marched up to the bench with red in tow delaney uttered an immense sigh of relief and then after a close scrutiny of reds face he whispered lock the gates  then the gong rang  the grays trooped in the stars ran out except gilbat who ambled like a giraffe  the hum of conversation in the grand stand quickened for a moment with the scraping of chairs and then grew quiet  the bleachers sent up the rollicking cry of expectancy  the umpire threw out a white ball with his stentorian play and blake of the grays strode to the plate  hitting safely he started the game with a rush with dorr up the star infield played for a bunt like clockwork dorr dumped the first ball as blake got his flying start for second base  morrissey tore in for the ball got it on the run and snapped it underhand to healy beating the runner by an inch  the fast blake with a long slide made third base the stands stamped  the bleachers howled  white next man up batted a high fly to left field  this was a sun field and the hardest to play in the league  red gilbat was the only man who ever played it well he judged the fly waited under it took a step hack then forward and deliberately caught the ball in his gloved hand  a throwin to catch the runner scoring from third base would have been futile but it was not like red gilbat to fail to try  he tossed the ball to obrien and blake scored amid applause  what do you know about that ejaculated delaney wiping his moist face  i never before saw our nutty redhead pull off a play like that  some of the players yelled at red this is a twohanded league you bat  the first five players on the list for the grays were lefthanded batters and against a righthanded pitcher whose most effective ball for them was a high fast one over the outer corner they would naturally hit toward left field  it was no surprise to see hanley bat a skyscraper out to left red had to run to get under it  he braced himself rather unusually for a fielder  he tried to catch the ball in his bare right hand and muffed it hanley got to second on the play while the audience roared  when they got through there was some roaring among the rochester players  scott and captain healy roared at red and red roared back at them  its all off  red never did that before cried delaney in despair hes gone clean bughouse now  babcock was the next man up and he likewise hit to left  it was a low twisting ballhalf fly half linerand a difficult one to field gilbat ran with great bounds and though he might have got two hands on the ball he did not try but this time caught it in his right retiring the side  the stars trotted in scott and healy and kane all veterans looking like thunderclouds  red ambled in the last and he seemed very nonchalant  by gosh id a ketched that one i muffed if id had time to change hands he said with a grin and he exposed a handful of peanuts  he had refused to drop the peanuts to make the catch with two hands  that explained the mystery  it was funny yet nobody laughed  there was that run chalked up against the stars and this game had to be won  red ii want to take the team home in the lead said delaney and it was plain that he suppressed strong feeling  you didnt play the game you know  red appeared mightily ashamed  del ill git that run back he said  then he strode to the plate swinging his wagontongue bat  for all his awkward position in the box he looked what he wasa formidable hitter he seemed to tower over the pitcherred was six feet oneand he scowled and shook his bat at wehying and called put one overyou wienerwurst  wehying was anything but redheaded and he wasted so many balls on red that it looked as if he might pass him  he would have passed him too if red had not stepped over on the fourth ball and swung on it  white at second base leaped high for the stinging hit and failed to reach it  the ball struck and bounded for the fence  when babcock fielded it in  red was standing on third base and the bleachers groaned  whereupon chesty reddy clammer proceeded to draw attention to himself and incidentally delay the game by assorting the bats as if the audience and the game might gladly wait years to see him make a choice  git in the game yelled delaney  aw take my bat duke of the abrubsky sarcastically said dump kane when the grouchy kane offered to lend his bat matters were critical in the star camp  other retorts followed which reddy clammer deigned not to notice  at last he got a bat that suited himand then importantly dramatically with his cap jauntily riding his red locks he marched to the plate  some wag in the bleachers yelled into the silence oh maggie your lover has come  not improbably clammer was thinking first of his presence before the multitude secondly of his batting average and thirdly of the run to be scored  in this instance he waited and feinted at balls and fouled strikes at length to work his base when he got to first base suddenly he bolted for second and in the surprise of the unlookedfor play he made it by a spreadeagle slide  it was a circus steal  delaney snorted  then the look of profound disgust vanished in a flash of light  his huge face beamed  reddie ray was striding to the plate  there was something about reddie ray that pleased all the senses  his lithe form seemed instinct with life any sudden movement was suggestive of stored lightning  his position at the plate was on the left side and he stood perfectly motionless with just a hint of tense waiting alertness  dorr blake and babcock the outfielders for the grays trotted round to the right of their usual position  delaney smiled derisively as if he knew how futile it was to tell what field reddie ray might hit into  wehying the old fox warily eyed the youngster and threw him a high curve close in  it grazed reddies shirt but he never moved a hair  then wehying after the manner of many veteran pitchers when trying out a new and menacing batter drove a straight fast ball at reddies head  reddie ducked neither too slow nor too quick just right to show what an eye he had how hard it was to pitch to  the next was a strike  and on the next he appeared to step and swing in one action  there was a ringing rap and the ball shot toward right curving down a vicious headed hit  mallory at first base snatched at it and found only the air  babcock had only time to take a few sharp steps and then he plunged down blocked the hit and fought the twisting ball  reddie turned first base flitted on toward second went headlong in the dust and shot to the base before white got the throwin from babcock  then as white wheeled and lined the ball home to catch the scoring clammer reddie ray leaped up got his sprinters start and like a rocket was off for third  this time he dove behind the base sliding in a half circle and as hanley caught stricklands perfect throw and whirled with the ball reddies hand slid to the bag  reddie got to his feet amid a rather breathless silence  even the coachers were quiet  there was a moment of relaxation then wehying received the ball from hanley and faced the batter  this was dump kane  there was a sign of some kind almost imperceptible between kane and reddie  as wehying half turned in his swing to pitch reddie ray bounded homeward  it was not so much the boldness of his action as the amazing swiftness of it that held the audience spellbound  like a thunderbolt reddie came down the line almost beating wehyings pitch to the plate  but kanes bat intercepted the ball laying it down and reddie scored without sliding dorr by sharp work just managed to throw kane out  three runs so quick it was hard to tell how they had come  not in the major league could there have been faster work  and the ball had been fielded perfectly and thrown perfectly  there you are said delaney hoarsely can you beat it  if youve been wonderin how the cripped stars won so many games just put what youve seen in your pipe and smoke it  red gilbat gets onreddy clammer gets onand then reddie ray drives them home or chases them home  the game went on and though it did not exactly drag it slowed down considerably  morrissey and healy were retired on infield plays  and the sides changed  for the grays obrien made a scratch hit went to second on stricklands sacrifice stole third and scored on mallorys infield out  wehying missed three strikes  in the stars turn the three end players on the batting list were easily disposed of  in the third inning the clever blake aided by a base on balls and a hit following tied the score and once more struck fire and brimstone from the impatient bleachers  providence was a town that had to have its team win  git at em reds said delaney gruffly  batter up called umpire fuller sharply  wheres red  wheres the bug  wheres the nut  delaney did you lock the gates  look under the bench  these and other remarks not exactly elegant attested to the mental processes of some of the stars red gilbat did not appear to be forthcoming  there was an anxious delay capt healy searched for the missing player delaney did not say any more  suddenly a door under the grand stand opened and red gilbat appeared he hurried for his bat and then up to the plate  and he never offered to hit one of the balls wehying shot over  when fuller had called the third strike red hurried back to the door and disappeared  somethin doin whispered delaney  lord chesterfield clammer paraded to the batters box and after gradually surveying the field as if picking out the exact place he meant to drive the ball he stepped to the plate  then a roar from the bleachers surprised him  well ill be doggoned exclaimed delaney red stole that sure as shootin  red gilbat was pushing a brandnew baby carriage toward the batters box  there was a tittering in the grand stand another roar from the bleachers  clammers face turned as red as his hair  gilbat shoved the baby carriage upon the plate spread wide his long arms made a short presentation speech and an elaborate bow then backed away  all eyes were centered on clammer  if he had taken it right the incident might have passed without undue hilarity  but clammer became absolutely wild with rage  it was well known that he was unmarried equally well was it seen that gilbat had executed one of his famous tricks ball players were inclined to be dignified about the presentation of gifts upon the field and clammer the dude the swell the ladys man the favorite of the baseball godsin his own estimationso far lost control of himself that he threw his bat at his retreating tormentor  red jumped high and the bat skipped along the ground toward the bench  the players sidestepped and leaped and of course the bat cracked one of delaneys big shins  his eyes popped with pain but he could not stop laughing  one by one the players lay down and rolled over and yelled  the superior clammer was not overliked by his coplayers  from the grand stand floated the laughter of ladies and gentlemen  and from the bleachersthat throne of the biting ironic scornful fanspealed up a howl of delight  it lasted for a full minute  then as quiet ensued some boy blew a blast of one of those infernal little instruments of pipe and rubber balloon and over the field wailed out a shrill highkeyed cry an excellent imitation of a baby  whereupon the whole audience roared and in discomfiture reddy clammer went in search of his bat  to make his chagrin all the worse he ingloriously struck out  and then he strode away under the lea of the grandstand wall toward right field  reddie ray went to bat and with the infield playing deep and the outfield swung still farther round to the right he bunted a little teasing ball down the thirdbase line  like a flash of light he had crossed first base before hanley got his hands on the ball  then kane hit into second base forcing reddie out  again the game assumed less spectacular and more ordinary play  both scott and wehying held the batters safely and allowed no runs  but in the fifth inning with the stars at bat and two out red gilbat again electrified the field  he sprang up from somewhere and walked to the plate his long shape enfolded in a fulllength linen duster  the color and style of this garment might not have been especially striking but upon red it had a weird and wonderful effect evidently red intended to bat while arrayed in his long coat for he stepped into the box and faced the pitcher  capt healy yelled for him to take the duster off  likewise did the grays yell  the bleachers shrieked their disapproval  to say the least red gilbats crazy assurance was dampening to the ardor of the most blindly confident fans  at length umpire fuller waved his hand enjoining silence and calling time  take it off or ill fine you  from his lofty height gilbat gazed down upon the little umpire and it was plain what he thought  what do i care for money replied red  that costs you twentyfive said fuller  cigarette change yelled red  costs you fifty  bah  go to an eye doctor roared red  seventyfive added fuller imperturbably  make it a hundred  its two hundred  robbber bawled red  fuller showed willingness to overlook reds back talk as well as costume and he called play  there was a mounting sensation of prophetic certainty  old fox wehying appeared nervous he wasted two balls on red then he put one over the plate and then he wasted another  three balls and one strike  that was a bad place for a pitcher and with red gilbat up it was worse wehying swung longer and harder to get all his left behind the throw and let drive  red lunged and cracked the ball  it went up and up and kept going up and farther out and as the murmuring audience was slowly transfixed into late realization the ball soared to its height and dropped beyond the leftfield fence  a home run  red gilbat gathered up the tails of his duster after the manner of a neat woman crossing a muddy street and ambled down to first base and on to second making prodigious jumps upon the bags and round third to come down the homestretch wagging his red head  then he stood on the plate and as if to exact revenge from the audience for the fun they made of him he threw back his shoulders and bellowed  haw haw haw  not a handclap greeted him but some mindless exceedingly adventurous fan yelled  redhead redhead  redhead  that was the one thing calculated to rouse red gilbat  he seemed to flare to bristle and he paced for the bleachers  delaney looked as if he might have a stroke grab him  soak him with a bat  somebody grab him  but none of the stars was risking so much and gilbat to the howling derision of the gleeful fans reached the bleachers  he stretched his long arms up to the fence and prepared to vault over wheres the guy who called me redhead he yelled  that was heaping fuel on the fire  from all over the bleachers from everywhere came the obnoxious word  red heaved himself over the fence and piled into the fans  then followed the roar of many voices the tramping of many feet the pressing forward of line after line of shirtsleeved men and boys  that bleacher stand suddenly assumed the maelstrom appearance of a surging mob round an agitated center  in a moment all the players rushed down the field and confusion reigned  oh  oh  oh moaned delaney  however the game had to go on  delaney no doubt felt all was over nevertheless there were games occasionally that seemed an unending series of unprecedented events  this one had begun admirably to break a record  and the providence fans like all other fans had cultivated an appetite as the game proceeded  they were wild to put the other redheads out of the field or at least out for the inning wild to tie the score wild to win and wilder than all for more excitement clammer hit safely  but when reddie ray lined to the second baseman clammer having taken a lead was doubled up in the play  of course the sixth inning opened with the stars playing only eight men  there was another delay  probably everybody except delaney and perhaps healy had forgotten the stars were short a man  fuller called time  the impatient bleachers barked for action  capt white came over to delaney and courteously offered to lend a player for the remaining innings  then a pompous individual came out of the door leading from the press boxeshe was a director delaney disliked  guess youd better let fuller call the game he said brusquely  if you want toas the score stands now in our favor replied delaney  not on your life  itll be ours or else well play it out and beat you to death  he departed in high dudgeon  tell reddie to swing over a little toward left was delaneys order to healy  fire gleamed in the managers eye  fuller called play then with reddy clammer and reddie ray composing the star outfield  and the grays evidently prepared to do great execution through the wide lanes thus opened up  at that stage it would not have been like matured ball players to try to crop hits down into the infield  white sent a long fly back of clammer  reddy had no time to loaf on this hit  it was all he could do to reach it and he made a splendid catch for which the crowd roundly applauded him  that applause was wine to reddy clammer  he began to prance on his toes and sing out to scott  make em hit to me old man  make em hit to me whether scott desired that or not was scarcely possible to say at any rate hanley pounded a hit through the infield  and clammer prancing high in the air like a checkreined horse ran to intercept the ball  he could have received it in his hands but that would never have served reddy clammer  he timed the hit to a nicety went down with his old grandstand play and blocked the ball with his anatomy  delaney swore and the bleachers now warm toward the gallant outfielder lustily cheered him  babcock hit down the rightfield foul line giving clammer a long run  hanley was scoring and babcock was sprinting for third base when reddy got the ball he had a fine arm and he made a hard and accurate throw catching his man in a close play  perhaps even delaney could not have found any fault with that play but the aftermath spoiled the thing  clammer now rode the air he soared he was in the clouds it was his inning and he had utterly forgotten his team mates except inasmuch as they were performing mere little automatic movements to direct the great machinery in his direction for his sole achievement and glory  there is fate in baseball as well as in other walks of life  obrien was a strapping fellow and he lifted another ball into clammers wide territory  the hit was of the high and faraway variety  clammer started to run with it not like a grim outfielder but like one thinking of himself his style his opportunity his inevitable success  certain it was that in thinking of himself the outfielder forgot his surroundings  he ran across the foul line head up hair flying unheeding the warning cry from healy  and reaching up to make his crowning circus play he smashed face forward into the bleachers fence  then limp as a rag he dropped  the audience sent forth a long groan of sympathy  that wasnt one of his stage falls said delaney  ill bet hes dead  poor reddy and i want him to bust his face  clammer was carried off the field into the dressing room and a physician was summoned out of the audience  cap whatd itdo to him asked delaney  aw spoiled his pretty mug thats all replied healy scornfully mebee hell listen to me now  delaneys change was characteristic of the man well if it didnt kill him im blamed glad he got it  cap we can trim em yet reddie rayll play the whole outfield  give reddie a chance to run tell the boy to cut loose  and all of you git in the game  win or lose i wont forget it  ive a hunch  once in a while i can tell whats comin off  some queer game this  and were goin to win gilbat lost the game clammer throwed it away again and now reddie rays due to win it  im all in but i wouldnt miss the finish to save my life  delaneys deep presaging sense of baseball events was never put to a greater test  and the seven stars with the score tied exhibited the temper and timber of a championship team in the last ditch  it was so splendid that almost instantly it caught the antagonistic bleachers  wherever the tired scott found renewed strength and speed was a mystery  but he struck out the hardhitting providence catcher and that made the third out  the stars could not score in their half of the inning  likewise the seventh inning passed without a run for either side only the infield work of the stars was something superb when the eighth inning ended without a tally for either team the excitement grew tense there was reddy ray playing outfield alone and the grays with all their desperate endeavors had not lifted the ball out of the infield  but in the ninth blake the first man up lined low toward right center  the hit was safe and looked good for three bases  no one looking however had calculated on reddies rays fleetness he covered ground and dove for the bounding ball and knocked it down blake did not get beyond first base  the crowd cheered the play equally with the prospect of a run  dorr bunted and beat the throw white hit one of the high fast balls scott was serving and sent it close to the leftfield foul line  the running reddie ray made on that play held white at second base  but two runs had scored with no one out  hanley the fourth lefthanded hitter came up and scott pitched to him as he had to the othershigh fast balls over the inside corner of the plate  reddy rays position was some fifty yards behind deep short and a little toward center field he stood sideways facing twothirds of that vacant outfield  in spite of scotts skill hanley swung the ball far round into right field but he hit it high and almost before he actually hit it the great sprinter was speeding across the green  the suspense grew almost unbearable as the ball soared in its parabolic flight and the redhaired runner streaked dark across the green the ball seemed never to be coming down  and when it began to descend and reached a point perhaps fifty feet above the ground there appeared more distance between where it would alight and where reddie was than anything human could cover  it dropped and dropped and then dropped into reddie rays outstretched hands  he had made the catch look easy but the fact that white scored from second base on the play showed what the catch really was  there was no movement or restlessness of the audience such as usually indicated the beginning of the exodus  scott struck babcock out  the game still had fire  the grays never let up a moment on their coaching  and the hoarse voices of the stars were grimmer than ever reddie ray was the only one of the seven who kept silent and he crouched like a tiger  the teams changed sides with the grays three runs in the lead morrissey for the stars opened with a clean drive to right  then healy slashed a ground ball to hanley and nearly knocked him down when old burns by a hard rap to short advanced the runners a base and made a desperate though unsuccessful effort to reach first the providence crowd awoke to a strange and inspiring appreciation  they began that most rare feature in baseball audiencesa strong and trenchant call for the visiting team to win  the play had gone fast and furious  wehying sweaty and disheveled worked violently  all the grays were on uneasy tiptoes  and the stars were seven indians on the warpath  halloran fouled down the rightfield line then he fouled over the leftfield fence  wehying tried to make him too anxious but it was in vain  halloran was implacable  with two strikes and three balls he hit straight down to white and was out  the ball had been so sharp that neither runner on base had a chance to advance  two men out two on base stars wanting three runs to tie scott a weak batter at the plate the situation was disheartening  yet there sat delaney shot through and through with some vital compelling force he saw only victory  and when the very first ball pitched to scott hit him on the leg giving him his base delaney got to his feet unsteady and hoarse  bases full reddie ray up three runs to tie  delaney looked at reddie  and reddie looked at delaney  the managers face was pale intent with a little smile  the player had eyes of fire a lean bulging jaw and the hands he reached for his bat clutched like talons  reddie i knew it was waitin for you said delaney his voice ringing  break up the game  after all this was only a baseball game and perhaps from the fans viewpoint a poor game at that  but the moment when that lithe redhaired athlete toed the plate was a beautiful one  the long crash from the bleachers the steady cheer from the grand stand proved that it was not so much the game that mattered  wehying had shot his bolt he was tired  yet he made ready for a final effort  it seemed that passing reddie ray on balls would have been a wise play at that juncture  but no pitcher probably would have done it with the bases crowded and chances of course against the batter  clean and swift reddie leaped at the first pitched ball  ping  for a second no one saw the hit  then it gleamed a terrific drive low along the ground like a bounding bullet straight at babcock in right field  it struck his hands and glanced viciously away to roll toward the fence  thunder broke loose from the stands  reddie ray was turning first base  beyond first base he got into his wonderful stride  some runners run with a consistent speed the best they can make for a given distance  but this trained sprinter gathered speed as he ran  he was no shortstepping runner  his strides were long  they gave an impression of strength combined with fleetness he had the speed of a race horse but the trimness the raciness the delicate legs were not characteristic of him  like the wind he turned second so powerful that his turn was short  all at once there came a difference in his running  it was no longer beautiful  the grace was gone  it was now fierce violent  his momentum was running him off his legs  he whirled around third base and came hurtling down the homestretch his face was convulsed his eyes were wild  his arms and legs worked in a marvelous muscular velocity  he seemed a demona flying streak he overtook and ran down the laboring scott who had almost reached the plate  the park seemed full of shrill piercing strife it swelled reached a highest pitch sustained that for a long moment and then declined  my gawd exclaimed delaney as he fell back  wasnt that a finish didnt i tell you to watch them redheads    the rube  it was the most critical time i had yet experienced in my career as a baseball manager and there was more than the usual reason why i must pull the team out  a chance for a business deal depended upon the goodwill of the stockholders of the worcester club  on the outskirts of the town was a little cottage that i wanted to buy and this depended upon the business deal  my whole future happiness depended upon the little girl i hoped to install in that cottage  coming to the worcester eastern league team i had found a strong aggregation and an enthusiastic following  i really had a team with pennant possibilities  providence was a strong rival but i beat them three straight in the opening series set a fast pace and likewise set worcester baseball mad  the eastern league clubs were pretty evenly matched still i continued to hold the lead until misfortune overtook me  gregg smashed an umpire and had to be laid off  mullaney got spiked while sliding and was out of the game  ashwell sprained his ankle and hirsch broke a finger  radbourne my great pitcher hurt his arm on a cold day and he could not get up his old speed  stringer who had batted three hundred and seventyone and led the league the year before struck a bad spell and could not hit a barn door handed up to him  then came the slump  the team suddenly let down went to pieces played ball that would have disgraced an amateur nine  it was a trying time here was a great team strong everywhere  a little hard luck had dug up a slumpand now day by day the team dropped in the race  when we reached the second division the newspapers flayed us  worcester would never stand for a second division team  baseball admirers reporters fansespecially the fansare fickle  the admirers quit the reporters grilled us and the fans though they stuck to the games with that barnaclelike tenacity peculiar to them made life miserable for all of us  i saw the pennant slowly fading and the successful season and the business deal and the cottage and milly  but when i thought of her i just could not see failure  something must be done but what  i was at the end of my wits  when jersey city beat us that saturday eleven to two shoving us down to fifth place with only a few percentage points above the fall river team i grew desperate and locking my players in the dressing room i went after them  they had lain down on me and needed a jar  i told them so straight and flat and being bitter i did not pick and choose my words  and fellows i concluded youve got to brace  a little more of this and we cant pull out i tell you youre a championship team  we had that pennant cinched  a few cuts and sprains and hard luckand you all quit  you lay down ive been patient  ive plugged for you never a man have i fined or thrown down  but now im at the end of my string  im out to fine you now and ill release the first man who shows the least yellow  i play no more substitutes crippled or not you guys have got to get in the game  i waited to catch my breath and expected some such outburst as managers usually get from criticized players  but not a word  then i addressed some of them personally  gregg your layoff ends today  you play monday  mullaney youve drawn your salary for two weeks with that spiked foot  if you cant run on itwell all right but i put it up to your good faith  ive played the game and i know its hard to run on a sore foot  but you can do it ashwell your ankle is lame i knownow can you run  sure i can  im not a quitter  im ready to go in replied ashwell  raddy how about you i said turning to my star twirler  connelly ive seen as fast a team in as bad a rut and yet pull out returned radbourne were about due for the brace  when it comeslook out  as for me well my arm isnt right but its acting these warm days in a way that tells me it will be soon  its been worked too hard cant you get another pitcher  im not knocking herne or cairns  theyre good for their turn but we need a new man to help out  and he must be a crackerjack if were to get back to the lead  where on earth can i find such a pitcher i shouted almost distracted  well thats up to you replied radbourne  up to me it certainly was and i cudgeled my brains for inspiration after i had given up in hopelessness it came in the shape of a notice i read in one of the papers  it was a brief mention of an amateur worcester ball team being shut out in a game with a rickettsville nine rickettsville played sunday ball which gave me an opportunity to look them over  it took some train riding and then a journey by coach to get to rickettsville  i mingled with the crowd of talking rustics  there was only one little bleachers and this was loaded to the danger point with the feminine adherents of the teams  most of the crowd centered alongside and back of the catchers box  i edged in and got a position just behind the stone that served as home plate  hunting up a player in this way was no new thing to me  i was too wise to make myself known before i had sized up the merits of my man  so before the players came upon the field i amused myself watching the rustic fans and listening to them  then a roar announced the appearance of the rickettsville team and their opponents who wore the name of spatsburg on their canton flannel shirts  the uniforms of these country amateurs would have put a philadelphia mummers parade to the blush at least for bright colors  but after one amused glance i got down to the stern business of the day and that was to discover a pitcher and failing that baseball talent of any kind  never shall i forget my first glimpse of the rickettsville twirler  he was far over six feet tall and as lean as a fence rail  he had a great shock of light hair a sunburned sharpfeatured face wide sloping shoulders and arms enormously long  he was about as graceful and had about as much of a baseball walk as a crippled cow  hes a rube i ejaculated in disgust and disappointment  but when i had seen him throw one ball to his catcher i grew as keen as a fox on a scent  what speed he had  i got round closer to him and watched him with sharp eager eyes  he was a giant  to be sure he was lean rawboned as a horse but powerful  what won me at once was his natural easy swing  he got the ball away with scarcely any effort  i wondered what he could do when he brought the motion of his body into play  bub what might be the pitchers name i asked of a boy  huh mister his name might be dennis but it aint  huh replied this country youngster evidently my question had thrown some implication upon this particular player  i reckon you be a stranger in these parts said a pleasant old fellow  his names hurtlewhitaker hurtle  whit fer short  he haint lost a goldarned game this summer  no siree never pitched any before nuther  hurtle  what a remarkably fitting name  rickettsville chose the field and the game began hurtle swung with his easy motion  the ball shot across like a white bullet  it was a strike and so was the next and the one succeeding  he could not throw anything but strikes and it seemed the spatsburg players could not make even a foul  outside of hurtles work the game meant little to me  and i was so fascinated by what i saw in him that i could hardly contain myself after the first few innings i no longer tried to  i yelled with the rickettsville rooters  the man was a wonder  a blind baseball manager could have seen that  he had a straight ball shoulder high level as a stretched string and fast  he had a jump ball which he evidently worked by putting on a little more steam and it was the speediest thing i ever saw in the way of a shoot  he had a widesweeping outcurve wide as the blade of a mowing scythe  and he had a dropan unhittable drop  he did not use it often for it made his catcher dig too hard into the dirt  but whenever he did i glowed all over  once or twice he used an underhand motion and sent in a ball that fairly swooped up  it could not have been hit with a board  and best of all dearest to the managers heart he had control  every ball he threw went over the plate  he could not miss it  to him that plate was as big as a house  what a find  already i had visions of the longlookedfor brace of my team and of the pennant and the little cottage and the happy light of a pair of blue eyes  what he meant to me that country pitcher hurtle  he shut out the spatsburg team without a run or a hit or even a scratch then i went after him  i collared him and his manager and there surrounded by the gaping players i bought him and signed him before any of them knew exactly what i was about  i did not haggle  i asked the manager what he wanted and produced the cash i asked hurtle what he wanted doubled his ridiculously modest demand paid him in advance and got his name to the contract  then i breathed a long deep breath the first one for weeks  something told me that with hurtles signature in my pocket i had the eastern league pennant  then i invited all concerned down to the rickettsville hotel  we made connections at the railroad junction and reached worcester at midnight in time for a good sleep  i took the silent and backward pitcher to my hotel  in the morning we had breakfast together  i showed him about worcester and then carried him off to the ball grounds  i had ordered morning practice and as morning practice is not conducive to the cheerfulness of ball players i wanted to reach the dressing room a little late  when we arrived all the players had dressed and were out on the field  i had some difficulty in fitting hurtle with a uniform and when i did get him dressed he resembled a twolegged giraffe decked out in white shirt gray trousers and maroon stockings  spears my veteran first baseman and captain of the team was the first to see us  sufferin umpires yelled spears  here you micks  look at this cons got with him  what a yell burst from that sore and disgruntled bunch of ball tossers my players were a grouchy set in practice anyway and today they were in their meanest mood  hey beanpole  get on to the stilts  con where did you find that  i cut short their chaffing with a sharp order for batting practice  regular lineup now no monkey biz i went on  take two cracks and a bunt  here hurtle i said drawing him toward the pitchers box dont pay any attention to their talk  thats only the fun of ball players  go in now and practice a little  lam a few over  hurtles big freckled hands closed nervously over the ball  i thought it best not to say more to him for he had a rather wild look  i remembered my own stage fright upon my first appearance in fast company  besides i knew what my amiable players would say to him  i had a secret hope and belief that presently they would yell upon the other side of the fence  mccall my speedy little left fielder led off at bat  he was full of ginger chipper as a squirrel sarcastic as only a tried ball player can be  put em over slats put em over he called viciously swinging his ash  hurtle stood stiff and awkward in the box and seemed to be rolling something in his mouth then he moved his arm  we all saw the ball dart down straightthat is all of us except mccall because if he had seen it he might have jumped out of the way  crack  the ball hit him on the shin  mccall shrieked  we all groaned  that crack hurt all of us  any baseball player knows how it hurts to be hit on the shinbone  mccall waved his bat madly  rube  rube  rube he yelled  then and there hurtle got the name that was to cling to him all his baseball days  mccall went back to the plate red in the face mad as a hornet and he sidestepped every time rube pitched a ball  he never even ticked one and retired in disgust limping and swearing ashwell was next  he did not show much alacrity on rubes first pitch down went ashwell flat in the dust  the ball whipped the hair of his head  rube was wild and i began to get worried ashwell hit a couple of measly punks but when he assayed a bunt the gang yelled derisively at him  whats he got  the old familiar cry of batters when facing a new pitcher  stringer went up bold and formidable  that was what made him the great hitter he was  he loved to bat he would have faced anybody he would have faced even a cannon  new curves were a fascination to him and speed for him in his own words was apple pie  in this instance surprise was in store for stringer  rube shot up the straight one then the wide curve then the drop  stringer missed them all struck out fell down ignominiously  it was the first time he had fanned that season and he looked dazed we had to haul him away  i called off the practice somewhat worried about rubes showing and undecided whether or not to try him in the game that day  so i went to radbourne who had quietly watched rube while on the field  raddy was an old pitcher and had seen the rise of a hundred stars  i told him about the game at rickettsville and what i thought of rube and frankly asked his opinion  con youve made the find of your life said raddy quietly and deliberately  this from radbourne was not only comforting it was relief hope assurance  i avoided spears for it would hardly be possible for him to regard the rube favorably and i kept under cover until time to show up at the grounds  buffalo was on the ticket for that afternoon and the bisons were leading the race and playing in topnotch form  i went into the dressing room while the players were changing suits because there was a little unpleasantness that i wanted to spring on them before we got on the field  boys i said curtly hurtle works today cut loose now and back him up  i had to grab a bat and pound on the wall to stop the uproar  did you mutts hear what i said  well it goes not a word now  im handling this team  were in bad i know but its my judgment to pitch hurtle rube or no rube and its up to you to back us  thats the baseball of it  grumbling and muttering they passed out of the dressing room  i knew ball players  if hurtle should happen to show good form they would turn in a flash  rube tagged reluctantly in their rear  he looked like a man in a trance  i wanted to speak encouragingly to him but raddy told me to keep quiet  it was inspiring to see my team practice that afternoon  there had come a subtle change  i foresaw one of those baseball climaxes that can be felt and seen but not explained  whether it was a hint of the hopedfor brace or only another flash of form before the final letdown i had no means to tell  but i was on edge  carter the umpire called out the batteries and i sent my team into the field  when that long lanky awkward rustic started for the pitchers box i thought the bleachers would make him drop in his tracks  the fans were sore on any one those days and a new pitcher was bound to hear from them  where  oh where  oh where  connellys found another dead one  scarecrow  look at his pants  pad his legs  then the inning began and things happened rube had marvelous speed but he could not find the plate  he threw the ball the second he got it he hit men walked men and fell all over himself trying to field bunts  the crowd stormed and railed and hissed  the bisons pranced round the bases and yelled like indians  finally they retired with eight runs  eight runs  enough to win two games  i could not have told how it happened  i was sick and all but crushed  still i had a blind dogged faith in the big rustic  i believed he had not got started right  it was a trying situation  i called spears and raddy to my side and talked fast  its all off now  let the dinged rube take his medicine growled spears  dont take him out said raddy  hes not shown at all whats in him  the blamed hayseed is up in the air  hes crazy  he doesnt know what hes doing  i tell you con he may be scared to death but hes dead in earnest  suddenly i recalled the advice of the pleasant old fellow at rickettsville  spears youre the captain i said sharply go after the rube wake him up  tell him he cant pitch  call him pogie  thats a name that stirs him up  well ill be dinged  he looks it replied spears  here rube get off the bench  come here  rube lurched toward us  he seemed to be walking in his sleep  his breast was laboring and he was dripping with sweat  who ever told you that you could pitch asked spears genially  he was master at baseball ridicule  i had never yet seen the youngster who could stand his badinage  he said a few things then wound up with  come now you cross between a hayrack and a wagon tongue get sore and do something  pitch if you can  show us  do you hear you towheaded pogie  rube jumped as if he had been struck  his face flamed red and his little eyes turned black  he shoved his big fist under capt spears nose  mister ill lick you fer thetafter the game and ill show you doggoned well how i can pitch  good exclaimed raddy and i echoed his word  then i went to the bench and turned my attention to the game  some one told me that mccall had made a couple of fouls and after waiting for two strikes and three balls had struck out  ashwell had beat out a bunt in his old swift style and stringer was walking up to the plate on the moment it was interesting even in a losing game to see stringer go to bat we all watched him as we had been watching him for weeks expecting him to break his slump with one of the drives that had made him famous stringer stood to the left side of the plate and i could see the bulge of his closely locked jaw  he swung on the first pitched ball  with the solid rap we all rose to watch that hit  the ball lined first then soared and did not begin to drop till it was far beyond the rightfield fence  for an instant we were all still so were the bleachers  stringer had broken his slump with the longest drive ever made on the grounds  the crowd cheered as he trotted around the bases behind ashwell  two runs  con howd you like that drive he asked me with a bright gleam in his eyes  oha beaut i replied incoherently  the players on the bench were all as glad as i was henley flew out to left  mullaney smashed a twobagger to right  then gregg hit safely but mullaney in trying to score on the play was out at the plate  four hits  i tell you fellows somethings coming off said raddy now if only rube  what a difference there was in that long rustic he stalked into the box unmindful of the hooting crowd and grimly faced schultz the first batter up for the bisons  this time rube was deliberate and where he had not swung before he now got his body and arm into full motion  the ball came in like a glint of light  schultz looked surprised  the umpire called strike  wow yelled the buffalo coacher  rube sped up the sidewheeler and schultz reached wide to meet it and failed  the third was the lightning drop straight over the plate  the batter poked weakly at it  then carl struck out and manning following did likewise  three of the best hitters in the eastern retired on nine strikes  that was no fluke  i knew what it meant and i sat there hugging myself with the hum of something joyous in my ears  gregg had a glow on his sweaty face  oh but say boys take a tip from me  the rubes a world beater  raddy knew it he sized up that swing and now i know it  get wise you its  when old spears pasted a single through shortstop the buffalo manager took clary out of the box and put in vane their best pitcher  bogart advanced the runner to second but was thrown out on the play  then rube came up  he swung a huge bat and loomed over the bisons twirler rube had the look of a hitter  he seemed to be holding himself back from walking right into the ball  and he hit one high and far away the fast carl could not get under it though he made a valiant effort spears scored and rubes long strides carried him to third  the cold crowd in the stands came to life even the sore bleachers opened up mccall dumped a slow teaser down the line a hit that would easily have scored rube but he ran a little way then stopped tried to get back and was easily touched out  ashwells hard chance gave the bisons shortstop an error and stringer came up with two men on bases stringer hit a foul over the rightfield fence and the crowd howled then he hit a hard long drive straight into the centerfielders hands  con i dont know what to think but ding me if we aint hittin the ball said spears  then to his players  a little more of that and were back in our old shape  all in a minuteat em now  rube you dinged old pogie pitch  rube toed the rubber wrapped his long brown fingers round the ball stepped out as he swung andzing  that inning he unloosed a few more kinks in his arm and he tried some new balls upon the bisons  but whatever he used and wherever he put them the result was the samethey cut the plate and the bisons were powerless  that inning marked the change in my team they had come hack  the hoodoo had vanished the championship worcester team was itself again  the bisons were fighting too but rube had them helpless  when they did hit a ball one of my infielders snapped it up  no chances went to the outfield  i sat there listening to my men and reveled in a moment that i had long prayed for  now youre pitching some rube  another strike  get him a board called ashwell  ding em rube ding em came from capt spears  speed  ohno yelled bogart at third base  its all off rube  its all offall off  so with the wonderful pitching of an angry rube the worcester team came into its own again  i sat through it all without another word without giving a signal  in a way i realized the awakening of the bleachers and heard the pound of feet and the crash but it was the spirit of my team that thrilled me  next to that the work of my new find absorbed me  i gloated over his easy deceiving swing  i rose out of my seat when he threw that straight fast ball swift as a bullet true as a plumb line  and when those hardhitting sure bunting bisons chopped in vain at the wonderful drop i choked back a wild yell  for rube meant the world to me that day  in the eighth the score was 8 to 6  the bisons had one scratch hit to their credit but not a runner had got beyond first base  again rube held them safely one man striking out another fouling out and the third going out on a little fly  crash  crash  crash  crash  the bleachers were making up for many games in which they could not express their riotous feelings  its a cinch well win yelled a fan with a voice  rube was the first man up in our half of the ninth and his big bat lammed the first ball safe over second base  the crowd hungry for victory got to their feet and stayed upon their feet calling cheering for runs  it was the moment for me to get in the game and i leaped up strung like a wire and white hot with inspiration i sent spears to the coaching box with orders to make rube run on the first ball  i gripped mccall with hands that made him wince  then i dropped back on the bench spent and panting  it was only a game yet it meant so much  little mccall was dark as a thunder cloud and his fiery eyes snapped  he was the fastest man in the league and could have bunted an arrow from a bow  the foxy bison third baseman edged in  mac feinted to bunt toward him then turned his bat inward and dumped a teasing curving ball down the first base line  rube ran as if in sevenleague boots  macs short legs twinkled he went like the wind he leaped into first base with his long slide and beat the throw  the stands and bleachers seemed to be tumbling down  for a moment the air was full of deafening sound  then came the pause the dying away of clatter and roar the close waiting suspended quiet  spears clear voice as he coached rube in its keen note seemed inevitable of another run  ashwell took his stand  he was another lefthand hitter and against a righthand pitcher in such circumstances as these the most dangerous of men  vane knew it  ellis the bison captain knew it as showed plainly in his signal to catch rube at second  but spears warning held or frightened rube on the bag  vane wasted a ball then another  ashwell could not be coaxed wearily vane swung the shortstop raced out to get in line for a possible hit through the wide space to his right and the second baseman got on his toes as both base runners started  crack  the old story of the hit and run game ashwells hit crossed sharply where a moment before the shortstop had been standing  with gigantic strides rube rounded the corner and scored  mccall flitted through second and diving into third with a cloud of dust got the umpires decision  when stringer hurried up with mac on third and ash on first the whole field seemed racked in a deafening storm  again it subsided quickly  the hopes of the worcester fans had been crushed too often of late for them to be fearless  but i had no fear  i only wanted the suspense ended  i was like a man clamped in a vise stringer stood motionless  mac bent low with the sprinters stoop ash watched the pitchers arm and slowly edged off first  stringer waited for one strike and two balls then he hit the next  it hugged the first base line bounced fiercely past the bag and skipped over the grass to bump hard into the fence  mccall romped home and lame ashwell beat any run he ever made to the plate rolling swelling crashing roar of frenzied feet could not down the high piercing sustained yell of the fans  it was great  three weeks of submerged bottled baseball joy exploded in one mad outburst  the fans too had come into their own again  we scored no more  but the bisons were beaten  their spirit was broken  this did not make the rube let up in their last half inning grim and pale he faced them  at every long step and swing he tossed his shock of light hair  at the end he was even stronger than at the beginning he still had the glancing floating airy quality that baseball players call speed  and he struck out the last three batters  in the tumult that burst over my ears i sat staring at the dots on my score card  fourteen strike outs one scratch hit  no base on balls since the first inning  that told the story which deadened senses doubted  there was a roar in my ears  some one was pounding me  as i struggled to get into the dressing room the crowd mobbed me  but i did not hear what they yelled i had a kind of misty veil before my eyes in which i saw that lanky rube magnified into a glorious figure  i saw the pennant waving and the gleam of a white cottage through the trees and a trim figure waiting at the gate  then i rolled into the dressing room  somehow it seemed strange to me  most of the players were stretched out in peculiar convulsions old spears sat with drooping head  then a wild flamingeyed giant swooped upon me  with a voice of thunder he announced  im agoin to lick you too  after that we never called him any name except rube    the rubes pennant  fellows its this way  youve got to win todays game  its the last of the season and means the pennant for worcester  one more hard scrap and were done  of all the uphill fights any bunch ever made to land the flag our has been the best  youre the best team i ever managed the gamest gang of ball players that ever stepped in spikes weve played in the hardest kind of luck all season except that short trip we called the rubes honeymoon  we got a bad start and sore arms and busted fingers all kinds of injuries every accident calculated to hurt a teams chances came our way  but in spite of it all we got the lead and weve held it and today were still a few points ahead of buffalo  i paused to catch my breath and looked round on the grim tired faces of my players  they made a stern group  the close of the season found them almost played out  what a hard chance it was after their extraordinary efforts to bring the issue of the pennant down to this last game  if we lose today buffalo with three games more to play at home will pull the bunting i went on  but theyre not going to win  im putting it up to you that way  i know spears is all in raddys arm is gone ash is playing on one leg youre all crippled  but youve got one more game in you i know  these last few weeks the rube has been pitching out of turn and hes about all in too  hes kept us in the lead  if he wins today itll be rubes pennant  but that might apply to all of you  now shall we talk over the play today  any tricks to pull off  any inside work  con youre pretty much upset an nervous replied spears soberly it aint no wonder this has been one corker of a season  i want to suggest that you let me run the team today  ive talked over the play with the fellers  we aint goin to lose this game con  buffalo has been comin with a rush lately an theyre confident but weve been holdin in restin up as much as we dared an still keep our lead mebbee itll surprise you to know weve bet every dollar we could get hold of on this game  why buffalo money is everywhere  all right spears ill turn the team over to you  weve got the banner crowd of the year out there right now a great crowd to play before im more fussed up over this game than any i remember  but i have a sort of blind faith in my team  i guess thats all i want to say  spears led the silent players out of the dressing room and i followed and while they began to toss balls to and fro to limber up cold dead arms i sat on the bench  the bisons were prancing about the diamond and their swaggering assurance was not conducive to hope for the worcesters  i wondered how many of that vast noisy audience intent on the days sport even had a thought of what pain and toil it meant to my players  the buffalo men were in good shape they had been lucky they were at the top of their stride and that made all the difference  at any rate there were a few faithful little women in the grand standmilly and nan and rose stringer and kate bogartwho sat with compressed lips and hoped and prayed for that game to begin and end  the gong called off the practice and spears taking the field yelled gruff encouragement to his men  umpire carter brushed off the plate and tossed a white ball to rube and called  play the bleachers set up an exultant satisfied shout and sat down to wait  schultz toed the plate and watched the rube pitch a couple  there seemed to be no diminution of the great pitchers speed and both balls cut the plate  schultz clipped the next one down the thirdbase line bogart trapped it close to the bag and got it away underhand beating the speedy runner by a nose  it was a pretty play to start with and the spectators were not closemouthed in appreciation  the short stocky carl ambled up to bat and i heard him call the rube something it was not a friendly contest this deciding game between buffalo and worcester  bing one close to his swelled nut growled spears to the rube  carl chopped a bouncing grounder through short and ash was after it like a tiger but it was a hit  the buffalo contingent opened up then manning faced the rube and he too vented sarcasm  it might not have been heard by the slow imperturbable pitcher for all the notice he took carl edged off first slid back twice got a third start and on the rubes pitch was off for second base with the lead that always made him dangerous manning swung vainly and gregg snapped a throw to mullaney  ball and runner got to the bag apparently simultaneously the umpire called carl out and the crowd uttered a quick roar of delight  the next pitch to manning was a strike  rube was not wasting any balls a point i noted with mingled fear and satisfaction  for he might have felt that he had no strength to spare that day and so could not try to work the batters  again he swung and manning rapped a long line fly over mccall  as the little left fielder turned at the sound of the hit and sprinted out his lameness was certainly not in evidence  he was the swiftest runner in the league and always when he got going the crowd rose in wild clamor to watch him mac took that fly right off the foul flag in deep left and the bleachers dinned their pleasure  the teams changed positions  fellers said spears savagely we may be a bungedup lot of stiffs but say  we can hit  if you love your old captainsting the ball  vane the bison pitcher surely had his work cut out for him  for one sympathetic moment i saw his part through his eyes  my worcester veterans long used to being under fire were relentlessly bent on taking that game  it showed in many ways particularly in their silence because they were seldom a silent team  mccall hesitated a moment over his bats  then as he picked up the lightest one i saw his jaw set and i knew he intended to bunt  he was lame yet he meant to beat out an infield hit  he went up scowling  vane had an old head and he had a varied assortment of balls  for mac he used an under hand curve rising at the plate and curving in to the lefthander  mac stepped back and let it go  thats the place bo cried the buffalo infielders  keep em close on the crab  eager and fierce as mccall was he let pitch after pitch go by till he had three balls and two strikes  still the heady vane sent up another pitch similar to the others  mac stepped forward in the box dropped his bat on the ball and leaped down the line toward first base  vane came rushing in for the bunt got it and threw  but as the speeding ball neared the baseman mac stretched out into the air and shot for the bag  by a fraction of a second he beat the ball  it was one of his demonslides  he knew that the chances favored his being crippled we all knew that some day mac would slide recklessly once too often  but that too is all in the game and in the spirit of a great player  were on said spears now keep with him  by that the captain meant that mac would go down and ashwell would hit with the run  when vane pitched little mccall was flitting toward second  the bison shortstop started for the bag and ash hit square through his tracks a rolling cheer burst from the bleachers and swelled till mccall overran third base and was thrown back by the coacher  stringer hurried forward with his big bat  oh  my yelled a fan and he voiced my sentiments exactly  here we would score and be one run closer to that dearly bought pennant  how well my men worked together  as the pitcher let the ball go ash was digging for second and mac was shooting plateward  they played on the chance of stringers hitting stringer swung the bat cracked we heard a thud somewhere and then manning half knocked over was fumbling for the ball  he had knocked down a terrific drive with his mitt and he got the ball in time to put stringer out  but mac scored and ash drew a throw to third base and beat it  he had a bad ankle but no one noticed it in that daring run  watch me paste one said captain spears as he spat several yards he batted out a fly so long and high and far that slow as he was he had nearly run to second base when carl made the catch  ash easily scored on the throwin  then bogart sent one skipping over second and treadwell scooping it on the run completed a play that showed why he was considered the star of the bison infield  two runs fellers said spears  thats some  push em over rube  the second inning somewhat quickened the pace  even the rube worked a little faster  ellis lined to cairns in right treadwell fouled two balls and had a called strike and was out mcknight hit a low fly over short then bud wiler sent one between spears and mullaney  spears went for it while the rube with giant strides ran to cover first base between them they got bud but it was only because he was heavy and slow on his feet  in our half of that inning mullaney gregg and cairns went out in one two three order  with pannell up i saw that the rube held in on his speed or else he was tiring  pannell hit the second slow ball for two bases  vane sacrificed and then the redoubtable schultz came up he appeared to be in no hurry to bat  then i saw that the foxy buffalo players were working to tire the rube  they had the situation figured but they were no wiser than old spears  make em hit rube  push em straight over never mind the corners we dont care for a few runs  well hit this game out  shultz flied to mac who made a beautiful throw to the plate too late to catch pannell  carl deliberately bunted to the right of the rube and it cost the big pitcher strenuous effort to catch his man  we got the rube waggin yelled a buffalo player  manning tripled down the left foul linea hit the bleachers called a screamer  when ellis came up it looked like a tie score and when the rube pitched it was plain that he was tired  the bisons yelled their assurance of this and the audience settled into quiet  ellis batted a scorcher that looked good for a hit  but the fast ashwell was moving with the ball and he plunged lengthwise to get it square in his glove the hit had been so sharp that he had time to get up and make the throw to beat the runner  the bleachers thundered at the play  youre up rube called spears  lam one out of the lot  the rube was an uncertain batter  there was never any telling what he might do for he had spells of good and bad hitting  but when he did get his bat on the ball it meant a chase for some fielder  he went up swinging his huge club and he hit a fly that would have been an easy home run for a fast man  but the best rube could do was to reach third base  this was certainly good enough as the bleachers loudly proclaimed and another tally for us seemed sure  mccall bunted toward third another of his teasers  the rube would surely have scored had he started with the ball but he did not try and missed a chance  wiler of course held the ball and mac got to first without special effort  he went down on the first pitch  then ash lined to carl  the rube waited till the ball was caught and started for home  the crowd screamed the rube ran for all he was worth and carls throw to the plate shot in low and true  ellis blocked the rube and tagged him out  it looked to the bleachers as if ellis had been unnecessarily rough and they hissed and stormed disapproval  as for me i knew the bisons were losing no chance to wear out my pitcher  stringer fouled out with mac on third and it made him so angry that he threw his bat toward the bench making some of the boys skip lively  the next three innings as far as scoring was concerned were all for buffalo  but the worcester infield played magnificent ball holding their opponents to one run each inning  that made the score 4 to 2 in favor of buffalo  in the last half of the sixth with ash on first base and two men out old spears hit another of his lofty flies and this one went over the fence and tied the score  how the bleachers roared it was full two minutes before they quieted down to make it all the more exciting bogart hit safely ran like a deer to third on mullaneys grounder which wiler knocked down and scored on a passed ball  gregg ended the inning by striking out  get at the rube boomed ellis the bison captain  well have him up in the air soon  get in the game now you stickers  before i knew what had happened the bisons had again tied the score they were indomitable they grew stronger all the time  a stroke of good luck now would clinch the game for them the rube was beginning to labor in the box ashwell was limping spears looked as if he would drop any moment mccall could scarcely walk but if the ball came his way he could still run nevertheless i never saw any finer fielding than these cripped players executed that inning  ashmaccan you hold out i asked when they limped in  i received glances of scorn for my question  spears however was not sanguine  ill stick pretty much if somethin doesnt happen he said but im all in  ill need a runner if i get to first this time  spears lumbered down to first base on an infield hit and the heavy manning gave him the hip old spears went down and i for one knew he was out in more ways than that signified by carters sharp  out  the old warhorse gathered himself up slowly and painfully and with his arms folded and his jaw protruding he limped toward the umpire  did you call me out he asked in a voice plainly audible to any one on the field  yes snapped carter  what for  i beat the ball an mannin played dirty with megave me the hip  i called you out  but i wasnt out  shut up now  get off the diamond ordered carter peremptorily  what  me  say im captain of this team cant i question a decision  not mine  spears youre delaying the game  i tell you it was a rotten decision yelled spears  the bleachers agreed with him  carter grew red in the face  he and spears had before then met in field squabbles and he showed it  fifty dollars  more  you cheapskate you piker  more  its a hundred  put me out of the game roared spears  you bet  hurry nowskedaddle  robbber bawled spears  then he labored slowly toward the bench all red and yet with perspiration his demeanor one of outraged dignity  the great crowd as one man stood up and yelled hoarsely at carter and hissed and railed at him  when spears got to the bench he sat down beside me as if in pain but he was smiling  con i was all in an knowin i couldnt play any longer thought id try to scare carter  say he was white in the face  if we play into a close decision now hell give it to us  bogart and mullaney batted out in short order and once more the aggressive bisons hurried in for their turn  spears sent cairns to first base and jones to right  the rube lobbed up his slow ball  in that tight pinch he showed his splendid nerve  two buffalo players overanxious popped up flies  the rube kept on pitching the slow curve until it was hit safely  then heaving his shoulders with all his might he got all the motion possible into his swing and let drive he had almost all of his old speed but it hurt me to see him work with such desperate effort he struck wiler out  he came stooping into the bench apparently deaf to the stunning round of applause  every player on the team had a word for the rube there was no quitting in that bunch and if i ever saw victory on the stern faces of ball players it was in that moment  we havent opened up yet  mebbee this is the innin  if it aint the next is said spears  with the weak end of the batting list up there seemed little hope of getting a run on vane that inning  he had so much confidence that he put the ball over for gregg who hit out of the reach of the infield again vane sent up his straight ball no doubt expecting cairns to hit into a double play  but cairns surprised vane and everybody else by poking a safety past first base the fans began to howl and pound and whistle  the rube strode to bat  the infield closed in for a bunt but the rube had no orders for that style of play  spears had said nothing to him vane lost his nonchalance and settled down  he cut loose with all his speed  rube stepped out suddenly whirled then tried to dodge but the ball hit him fair in the back  rube sagged in his tracks then straightened up and walked slowly to first base  score 5 to 5 bases full no outs mccall at bat  i sat dumb on the bench thrilling and shivering  mccall  ashwell  stringer to bat  play it safe  hold the bags yelled the coacher  mccall fairly spouted defiance as he faced vane  pitch  its all off  an you know it  if vane knew that he showed no evidence of it  his face was cold unsmiling rigid  he had to pitch to mccall the fastest man in the league to ashwell the best bunter to stringer the champion batter it was a supreme test for a great pitcher  there was only one kind of a ball that mccall was not sure to hit and that was a high curve in close  vane threw it with all his power carter called it a strike again vane swung and his arm fairly cracked  mac fouled the ball  the third was wide  slowly with lifting breast vane got ready whirled savagely and shot up the ball mccall struck out  as the buffalo players crowed and the audience groaned it was worthy of note that little mccall showed no temper  yet he had failed to grasp a great opportunity  ash i couldnt see em he said as he passed to the bench  speed whew look out for it hes been savin up  hit quick an youll get him  ashwell bent over the plate and glowered at vane  pitch  its all off  an you know it he hissed using macs words  ashwell too was lefthanded he too was extremely hard to pitch to and if he had a weakness that any of us ever discovered it was a slow curve and change of pace  but i doubted if vane would dare to use slow balls to ash at that critical moment  i had yet to learn something of vane he gave ash a slow widesweeping sidewheeler that curved round over the plate  ash always took a strike so this did not matter then vane used his deceptive change of pace sending up a curve that just missed ashs bat as he swung  oh  ahh hit wailed the bleachers  vane doubled up like a contortionist and shot up a lightningswift drop that fooled ash completely  again the crowd groaned  score tied bases full two out stringer at bat  its up to you string called ash stepping aside  stringer did not call out to vane  that was not his way  he stood tense and alert bat on his shoulder his powerful form braced and he waited  the outfielders trotted over toward right field and the infielders played deep calling out warnings and encouragement to the pitcher stringer had no weakness and vane knew this nevertheless he did not manifest any uneasiness and pitched the first ball without any extra motion  carter called it a strike  i saw stringer sink down slightly and grow tenser all over  i believe that moment was longer for me than for either the pitcher or the batter  vane took his time watched the base runners feinted to throw to catch them and then delivered the ball toward the plate with the limit of his power  stringer hit the ball  as long as i live i will see that glancing low liner  shultz by a wonderful play in deep center blocked the ball and thereby saved it from being a home run  but when stringer stopped on second base all the runners had scored  a shrill shrieking highpitched yell  the bleachers threatened to destroy the stands and also their throats in one long revel of baseball madness  jones batting in place of spears had gone up and fouled out before the uproar had subsided  fellers i reckon i feel easier said the rube it was the only time i had ever heard him speak to the players at such a stage  only six batters rube called out spears boys its a grand game an its ourn  the rube had enough that inning to dispose of the lower half of the buffalo list without any alarming bids for a run  and in our half bogart and mullaney hit vicious ground balls that gave treadwell and wiler opportunities for superb plays  carl likewise made a beautiful running catch of greggs line fly  the bisons were still in the game still capable of pulling it out at the last moment  when shultz stalked up to the plate i shut my eyes a moment and so still was it that the field and stands might have been empty  yet though i tried i could not keep my eyes closed  i opened them to watch the rube  i knew spears felt the same as i for he was blowing like a porpoise and muttering to himself  mebee the rube wont last an ive no one to put in  the rube pitched with heavy violent effort he had still enough speed to be dangerous  but after the manner of ball players shultz and the coachers mocked him  take all you can called ellis to shultz  every pitch lessened the rubes strength and these wise opponents knew it  likewise the rube himself knew and never had he shown better head work than in this inning  if he were to win he must be quick  so he wasted not a ball  the first pitch and the second delivered breast high and fairly over the plate beautiful balls to hit shultz watched speed by  he swung hard on the third and the crippled ashwell dove for it in a cloud of dust got a hand in front of it but uselessly for the hit was safe  the crowd cheered that splendid effort  carl marched to bat and he swung his club over the plate as if he knew what to expect  come on rube he shouted  wearily doggedly the rube whirled and whipped his arm  the ball had all his old glancing speed and it was a strike the rube was making a tremendous effort again he got his body in convulsive motiontwo strikes  shultz had made no move to run nor had carl made any move to hit  these veterans were waiting  the rube had pitched five strikescould he last  now carl yelled ellis with startling suddenness as the rube pitched again  crack  carl placed that hit as safely through short as if he had thrown it  mccalls little legs twinkled as he dashed over the grass he had to head off that hit and he ran like a streak  down and forward he pitched as if in one of his fierce slides and he got his body in front of the ball blocking it and then he rolled over and over  but he jumped up and lined the ball to bogart almost catching shultz at thirdbase  then as mac tried to walk his lame leg buckled under him and down he went and out  call time i called to carter  mccall is done  myers you go to left an for lords sake play ball  stringer and bogart hurried to mac and lifting him up and supporting him between them with his arms around their shoulders they led him off amid cheers from the stands  mac was white with pain  naw i wont go off the field  leave me on the bench he said fight em now  its our game  never mind a couple of runs  the boys ran back to their positions and carter called play  perhaps a little delay had been helpful to the rube  slowly he stepped into the box and watched shultz at third and carl at second there was not much probability of his throwing to catch them off the base but enough of a possibility to make them careful so he held them close  the rube pitched a strike to manning then another  that made eight strikes square over the plate that inning  what magnificent control it was equaled by the implacable patience of those veteran bisons manning hit the next ball as hard as carl had hit his  but mullaney plunged down came up with the ball feinted to fool carl then let drive to gregg to catch the fleeting shultz the throw went wide but gregg got it and leaping lengthwise tagged shultz out a yard from the plate  one out  two runners on bases  the bleachers rose and split their throats  would the inning never end  spears kept telling himself  theyll score but well win  its our game  i had a sickening fear that the strange confidence that obsessed the worcester players had been blind unreasoning vanity  carl will steal muttered spears  he cant be stopped  spears had called the play  the rube tried to hold the little basestealer close to second but after one attempt wisely turned to his hard task of making the bisons hit and hit quickly  ellis let the ball pass gregg made a perfect throw to third bogart caught the ball and moved like a flash but carl slid under his hands to the bag manning ran down to second  the rube pitched again and this was his tenth ball over the plate even the buffalo players evinced eloquent appreciation of the rubes defence at this last stand  then ellis sent a clean hit to right scoring both carl and manning  i breathed easier for it seemed with those two runners in the rube had a better chance  treadwell also took those two runners in the rube had a way those bisons waited  they had their reward for the rubes speed left him  when he pitched again the ball had control but no shoot  treadwell hit it with all his strength  like a huge cat ashwell pounced upon it ran over second base forcing ellis and his speedy snap to first almost caught treadwell  score 8 to 7  two out  runner on first  one run to tie  in my hazy dimmed vision i saw the rubes pennant waving from the flagpole  its our game howled spears in my ear for the noise from the stands was deafening its our pennant  the formidable batting strength of the bisons had been met not without disaster but without defeat  mcknight came up for buffalo and the rube took his weary swing  the batter made a terrific lunge and hit the ball with a solid crack it lined for center  suddenly electrified into action i leaped up that hit  it froze me with horror  it was a homerun  i saw stringer fly toward left center he ran like something wild  i saw the heavy treadwell lumbering round the bases  i saw ashwell run out into center field  ahh  the whole audience relieved its terror in that expulsion of suspended breath stringer had leaped high to knock down the ball saving a sure homerun and the game  he recovered himself dashed back for the ball and shot it to ash  when ash turned toward the plate treadwell was rounding third base  a tie score appeared inevitable  i saw ashs arm whip and the ball shoot forward leveled glancing beautiful in its flight  the crowd saw it and the silence broke to a yell that rose and rose as the ball sped in that yell swelled to a splitting shriek and treadwell slid in the dust and the ball shot into greggs hands all at the same instant  carter waved both arms upwards  it was the umpires action when his decision went against the baserunner  the audience rolled up one great stentorian cry  out  i collapsed and sank back upon the bench  my confused senses received a dull roar of pounding feet and dinning voices as the herald of victory i felt myself thinking how pleased milly would be i had a distinct picture in my mind of a white cottage on a hill no longer a dream but a reality made possible for me by the rubes winning of the pennant    the rubes honeymoon  hes got a new manager  watch him pitch now  that was what nan brown said to me about rube hurtle my great pitcher and i took it as her way of announcing her engagement  my baseball career held some proud moments but this one wherein i realized the success of my matchmaking plans was certainly the proudest one  so entirely outside of the honest pleasure i got out of the rubes happiness there was reason for me to congratulate myself he was a transformed man so absolutely renewed so wild with joy that on the strength of it i decided the pennant for worcester was a foregone conclusion and sure of the money promised me by the directors milly and i began to make plans for the cottage upon the hill  the rube insisted on pitching mondays game against the torontos and although poor fielding gave them a couple of runs they never had a chance  they could not see the ball  the rube wrapped it around their necks and between their wrists and straight over the plate with such incredible speed that they might just as well have tried to bat rifle bullets  that night i was happy  spears my veteran captain was one huge smile radbourne quietly assured me that all was over now but the shouting all the boys were happy  and the rube was the happiest of all  at the hotel he burst out with his exceeding good fortune  he and nan were to be married upon the fourth of july  after the noisy congratulations were over and the rube had gone spears looked at me and i looked at him  con said he soberly we just cant let him get married on the fourth  why not  sure we can  well help him get married  i tell you itll save the pennant for us look how he pitched today  nan brown is our salvation  see here con youve got softenin of the brain too  wheres your baseball sense  weve got a pennant to win  by july fourth well be close to the lead again an theres that three weeks trip on the road the longest an hardest of the season  weve just got to break even on that trip  you know what that means  if the rube marries nanwhat are we goin to do  we cant leave him behind  if he takes nan with uswhy itll be a honeymoon  an half the gang is stuck on nan brown  an nan brown would flirt in her bridal veil   why con were up against a worse proposition than ever  good heavens cap  youre right i groaned  i never thought of that  weve got to postpone the wedding  how on earth can we ive heard her tell milly that  shell never consent to it  say thisll drive me to drink  all i got to say is this con  if the rube takes his wife on that trip its goin to be an allfired hummer  dont you forget that  im not likely to  but spears the point is thiswill the rube win his games  figurin from his work today id gamble hell never lose another game  it aint that  im thinkin of what the gang will do to him an nan on the cars an at the hotels  oh lord con it aint possible to stand for that honeymoon trip just think  if the worst comes to the worst cap i dont care for anything but the games  if we get in the lead and stay there ill stand for anything couldnt the gang be coaxed or bought off to let the rube and nan alone  not on your life  there aint enough love or money on earth to stop them  itll be awful mind im not responsible  dont you go holdin me responsible  in all my years of baseball i never went on a trip with a bride in the game thats new on me an i never heard of it id be bad enough if he wasnt a rube an if she wasnt a crazy girlfan an a flirt to boot an with half the boys in love with her but as it is  spears gave up and gravely shaking his head he left me  i spent a little while in sober reflection and finally came to the conclusion that in my desperate ambition to win the pennant i would have taken half a dozen rube pitchers and their baseballmade brides on the trip if by so doing i could increase the percentage of games won nevertheless i wanted to postpone the rubes wedding if it was possible and i went out to see milly and asked her to help us  but for once in her life milly turned traitor  connie you dont want to postpone it  why how perfectly lovely  mrs stringer will go on that trip and mrs bogart  connie im going too  she actually jumped up and down in glee  that was the woman in her it takes a wedding to get a woman  i remonstrated and pleaded and commanded all to no purpose  milly intended to go on that trip to see the games and the fun and the honeymoon  she coaxed so hard that i yielded  thereupon she called up mrs stringer on the telephone and of course found that young woman just as eager as she was  for my part i threw anxiety and care to the four winds and decided to be as happy as any of them  the pennant was mine  something kept ringing that in my ears  with the rube working his iron arm for the edification of his proud nancy brown there was extreme likelihood of divers shutouts and humiliating defeats for some eastern league teams  how well i calculated became a matter of baseball history during that last week of june  we won six straight games three of which fell to the rubes credit  his opponents scored four runs in the three games against the nineteen we made upon july 1 radbourne beat providence and cairns won the second game  we now had a string of eight victories  sunday we rested and monday was the fourth with morning and afternoon games with buffalo  upon the morning of the fourth i looked for the rube at the hotel but could not find him  he did not show up at the grounds when the other boys did and i began to worry  it was the rubes turn to pitch and we were neck and neck with buffalo for first place  if we won both games we would go ahead of our rivals  so i was all on edge and kept going to the dressingroom to see if the rube had arrived  he came finally when all the boys were dressed and about to go out for practice  he had on a new suit a tailormade suit at that and he looked fine there was about him a kind of strange radiance  he stated simply that he had arrived late because he had just been married  before congratulations were out of our mouths he turned to me  con i want to pitch both games today he said  what  say whit buffalo is on the card today and we are only three points behind them if we win both well be leading the league once more  i dont know about pitching you both games  i reckon well be in the lead tonight then he replied for ill win them both  i was about to reply when dave the groundkeeper called me to the door saying there was a man to see me  i went out and there stood morrisey manager of the chicago american league team  we knew each other well and exchanged greetings  con i dropped off to see you about this new pitcher of yours the one they call the rube  i want to see him work  ive heard hes pretty fast  how about it  waittill you see him pitch i replied  i could scarcely get that much out for morriseys presence meant a great deal and i did not want to betray my elation  any strings on him queried the big league manager sharply  well morrisey not exactly  i can give you the first call  youll have to bid high though just wait till you see him work  im glad to hear that  my scout was over here watching him pitch and says hes a wonder  what luck it was that morrisey should have come upon this day  i could hardly contain myself almost i began to spend the money i would get for selling the rube to the big league manager we took seats in the grand stand as morrisey did not want to be seen by any players and i stayed there with him until the gong sounded there was a big attendance  i looked all over the stand for nan but she was lost in the gay crowd  but when i went down to the bench i saw her up in my private box with milly  it took no second glance to see that nan brown was a bride and glorying in the fact  then in the absorption of the game i became oblivious to milly and nan the noisy crowd the giant firecrackers and the smoke to the presence of morrisey to all except the rube and my team and their opponents  fortunately for my hopes the game opened with characteristic worcester dash  little mccall doubled ashwell drew his base on four wide pitches and stringer drove the ball over the rightfield fencethree runs  three runs were enough to win that game  of all the exhibitions of pitching with which the rube had favored us this one was the finest it was perhaps not so much his marvelous speed and unhittable curves that made the game one memorable in the annals of pitching it was his perfect control in the placing of balls in the cutting of corners in his absolute implacable mastery of the situation  buffalo was unable to find him at all  the game was swift short decisive with the score 5 to 0 in our favor  but the score did not tell all of the rubes work that morning  he shut out buffalo without a hit or a scratch the first nohit norun game of the year  he gave no base on balls not a buffalo player got to first base only one fly went to the outfield  for once i forgot milly after a game and i hurried to find morrisey and carried him off to have dinner with me  your rube is a wonder and thats a fact he said to me several times  where on earth did you get him  connelly hes my meat  do you understand  can you let me have him right now  no morrisey ive got the pennant to win first  then ill sell him  how much  do you hear  how much morrisey hammered the table with his fist and his eyes gleamed  carried away as i was by his vehemence i was yet able to calculate shrewdly and i decided to name a very high price from which i could come down and still make a splendid deal  how much demanded morrisey  five thousand dollars i replied and gulped when i got the words out  morrisey never batted an eye  waiter quick pen and ink and paper  presently my hand none too firm was signing my name to a contract whereby i was to sell my pitcher for five thousand dollars at the close of the current season  i never saw a man look so pleased as morrisey when he folded that contract and put it in his pocket  he bade me goodbye and hurried off to catch a train and he never knew the rube had pitched the great game on his wedding day  that afternoon before a crowd that had to be roped off the diamond i put the rube against the bisons  how well he showed the baseball knowledge he had assimilated  he changed his style in that second game  he used a slow ball and wide curves and took things easy  he made buffalo hit the ball and when runners got on bases once more let out his speed and held them down  he relied upon the players behind him and they were equal to the occasion  it was a totally different game from that of the morning and perhaps one more suited to the pleasure of the audience  there was plenty of hard hitting sharp fielding and good base running and the game was close and exciting up to the eighth when mullaneys triple gave us two runs and a lead that was not headed  to the deafening roar of the bleachers the rube walked off the field having pitched worcester into first place in the pennant race  that night the boys planned their first job on the rube  we had ordered a special pullman for travel to toronto and when i got to the depot in the morning the pullman was a white fluttering mass of satin ribbons  also there was a brass band and thousands of baseball fans and barrels of old footgear  the rube and nan arrived in a cab and were immediately mobbed the crowd roared the band played the engine whistled the bell clanged and the air was full of confetti and slippers and showers of rice like hail pattered everywhere  a somewhat dishevelled bride and groom boarded the pullman and breathlessly hid in a state room  the train started and the crowd gave one last rousing cheer  old spears yelled from the back platform  fellers an fans you neednt worry none about leavin the rube an his bride to the tender mercies of the gang  a hundred years from now people will talk about this honeymoon baseball trip  wait till we come backan say jest to put you wise no matter what else happens were comin back in first place  it was surely a merry party in that pullman the bridal couple emerged from their hiding place and held a sort of reception in which the rube appeared shy and frightened and nan resembled a joyous fluttering bird in gray  i did not see if she kissed every man on the team but she kissed me as if she had been wanting to do it for ages milly kissed the rube and so did the other women to his infinite embarrassment  nans effect upon that crowd was most singular  she was sweetness and caprice and joy personified  we settled down presently to something approaching order and i for one with very keen ears and alert eyes because i did not want to miss anything  i see the lambs agambolin observed mccall in a voice louder than was necessary to convey his meaning to mullaney his partner in the seat  yes it do seem as if there was joy aboundin hereabouts replied mul with fervor  its more springtime than summer said ashwell an everything in nature is runnin in pairs  there are the sheep an the cattle an the birds  i see two kingfishers fishin over here an theres a couple of honeybees makin honey oh honey an by george if there aint two butterflies foldin their wings round each other  see the dandelions kissin in the field  then the staid captain spears spoke up with an appearance of sincerity and a tone that was nothing short of remarkable  reggie see the sunshine asleep upon yon bank  aint it lovely  an that white cloud sailin thither amid the bluehow spontaneous joy is abroad oer all this bootiful land todayoh yes  an loves wings hover o er the little lambs an the bullfrogs in the pond an the dicky birds in the trees  what sweetness to lie in the grass the lap of bounteous earth eatin apples in the garden of eden an chasin away the snakes an dreamin of thee sweetheart  spears was singing when he got so far and there was no telling what he might have done if mullaney unable to stand the agony had not jabbed a pin in him  but that only made way for the efforts of the other boys each of whom tried to outdo the other in poking fun at the rube and nan  the big pitcher was too gloriously happy to note much of what went on around him but when it dawned upon him he grew red and white by turns  nan however was more than equal to the occasion  presently she smiled at spears such a smile  the captain looked as if he had just partaken of an intoxicating wine  with a heightened color in her cheeks and a dangerous flash in her roguish eyes nan favored mccall with a look which was as much as to say that she remembered him with a dear sadness  she made eyes at every fellow in the car and then bringing back her gaze to the rube as if glorying in comparison she nestled her curly black head on his shoulder  he gently tried to move her but it was not possible nan knew how to meet the ridicule of half a dozen old lovers  one by one they buried themselves in newspapers and finally mccall for once utterly beaten showed a white feather and sank back out of sight behind his seat  the boys did not recover from that shock until late in the afternoon as it was a physical impossibility for nan to rest her head all day upon her husbands broad shoulder the boys toward dinner time came out of their jealous trance  i heard them plotting something  when dinner was called about half of my party including the bride and groom went at once into the diningcar time there flew by swiftly  and later when we were once more in our pullman and i had gotten interested in a game of cards with milly and stringer and his wife the rube came marching up to me with a very red face  con i reckon some of the boys have stolen myour grips said he  what i asked blankly  he explained that during his absence in the diningcar someone had entered his stateroom and stolen his grip and nans  i hastened at once to aid the rube in his search  the boys swore by everything under and beyond the sun they had not seen the grips they appeared very much grieved at the loss and pretended to help in searching the pullman  at last with the assistance of a porter we discovered the missing grips in an upper berth  the rube carried them off to his stateroom and we knew soon from his uncomplimentary remarks that the contents of the suitcases had been mixed and manhandled  but he did not hunt for the jokers  we arrived at toronto before daylight next morning and remained in the pullman until seven oclock  when we got out it was discovered that the rube and nan had stolen a march upon us we traced them to the hotel and found them at breakfast  after breakfast we formed a merry sightseeing party and rode all over the city  that afternoon when raddy let toronto down with three hits and the boys played a magnificent game behind him and we won 7 to 2 i knew at last and for certain that the worcester team had come into its own again  then next day cairns won a close exciting game and following that on the third day the matchless rube toyed with the torontos eleven straight games won  i was in the clouds and never had i seen so beautiful a light as shone in millys eyes  from that day the honeymoon trip of the worcester baseball club as the newspapers heralded itwas a triumphant march  we won two out of three games at montreal broke even with the hardfighting bisons took three straight from rochester and won one and tied one out of three with hartford  it would have been wonderful ball playing for a team to play on home grounds and we were doing the full circuit of the league  spears had called the turn when he said the trip would be a hummer nan hurtle had brought us wonderful luck  but the tricks they played on whit and his girlfan bride  ashwell who was a capital actor disguised himself as a conductor and pretended to try to eject whit and nan from the train urging that lovemaking was not permitted  some of the team hired a clever young woman to hunt the rube up at the hotel and claim old acquaintance with him  poor whit almost collapsed when the young woman threw her arms about his neck just as nan entered the parlor  upon the instant nan became wild as a little tigress and it took much explanation and eloquence to reinstate whit in her affections  another time spears the wily old fox succeeded in detaining nan on the way to the station and the two missed the train  at first the rube laughed with the others but when stringer remarked that he had noticed a growing attachment between nan and spears my great pitcher experienced the first pangs of the greeneyed monster  we had to hold him to keep him from jumping from the train and it took milly and mrs stringer to soothe him  i had to wire back to rochester for a special train for spears and nan and even then we had to play half a game without the services of our captain  so far upon our trip i had been fortunate in securing comfortable rooms and the best of transportation for my party  at hartford however i encountered difficulties  i could not get a special pullman and the sleeper we entered already had a number of occupants  after the ladies of my party had been assigned to berths it was necessary for some of the boys to sleep double in upper berths  it was late when we got aboard the berths were already made up and soon we had all retired in the morning very early i was awakened by a disturbance  it sounded like a squeal  i heard an astonished exclamation another squeal the pattering of little feet then hoarse uproar of laughter from the ball players in the upper berths following that came low excited conversation between the porter and somebody then an angry snort from the rube and the thud of his heavy feet in the aisle  what took place after that was guesswork for me  but i gathered from the roars and bawls that the rube was after some of the boys  i poked my head between the curtains and saw him digging into the berths  wheres mccall he yelled  mac was nowhere in that sleeper judging from the vehement denials but the rube kept on digging and prodding in the upper berths  im agoin to lick you mac so i reckon youd better show up shouted the rube  the big fellow was mad as a hornet  when he got to me he grasped me with his great fencerail splitting hands and i cried out with pain  say  whit let up  macs not here whats wrong  ill show you when i find him  and the rube stalked on down the aisle a tragically comic figure in his pajamas  in his search for mac he pried into several upper berths that contained occupants who were not ball players and these protested in affright  then the rube began to investigate the lower berths  a row of heads protruded in a bobbing line from between the curtains of the upper berths  here you indian  dont you look in there thats my wifes berth yelled stringer  bogart too evinced great excitement  hurtle keep out of lower eight or ill kill you he shouted  what the rube might have done there was no telling but as he grasped a curtain he was interrupted by a shriek from some woman assuredly not of our party  get out you horrid wretch  help  porter help  conductor  instantly there was a deafening tumult in the car  when it had subsided somewhat and i considered i would be safe i descended from my berth and made my way to the dressing room sprawled over the leather seat was the rube pommelling mccall with hearty good will  i would have interfered had it not been for macs demeanor  he was half frightened half angry and utterly unable to defend himself or even resist because he was laughing too  doggone it  whiti didntdo it  i swear it was spears  stop thumpin me nowor ill get sore  you hear me  it wasnt me i tell you  cheese it  for all his protesting mac received a good thumping and i doubted not in the least that he deserved it  the wonder of the affair however was the fact that no one appeared to know what had made the rube so furious  the porter would not tell and mac was strangely reticent though his smile was one to make a fellow exceedingly sure something out of the ordinary had befallen it was not until i was having breakfast in providence that i learned the true cause of rubes conduct and milly confided it to me insisting on strict confidence  i promised not to tell she said  now you promise youll never tell  well connie went on milly when i had promised it was the funniest thing yet but it was horrid of mccall  you see the rube had upper seven and nan had lower seven  early this morning about daylight nan awoke very thirsty and got up to get a drink  during her absence probably but any way some time last night mccall changed the number on her curtain and when nan came back to number seven of course she almost got in the wrong berth  no wonder the rube punched him i declared i wish we were safe home  somethingll happen yet on this trip  i was faithful to my promise to milly but the secret leaked out somewhere perhaps mac told it and before the game that day all the players knew it  the rube having recovered his good humor minded it not in the least  he could not have felt illwill for any length of time  everything seemed to get back into smooth running order and the honeymoon trip bade fair to wind up beautifully  but somehow or other and about something unknown to the rest of us the rube and nan quarreled  it was their first quarrel  milly and i tried to patch it up but failed  we lost the first game to providence and won the second  the next day a saturday was the last game of the trip and it was rubes turn to pitch  several times during the first two days the rube and nan about half made up their quarrel only in the end to fall deeper into it then the last straw came in a foolish move on the part of wilful nan she happened to meet henderson her former admirer and in a flash she took up her flirtation with him where she had left off  dont go to the game with him nan i pleaded  its a silly thing for you to do  of course you dont mean anything except to torment whit  but cut it out  the gang will make him miserable and well lose the game  theres no telling what might happen  im supremely indifferent to what happens she replied with a rebellious toss of her black head  i hope whit gets beaten  she went to the game with henderson and sat in the grand stand and the boys spied them out and told the rube  he did not believe it at first but finally saw them looked deeply hurt and offended and then grew angry  but the gong sounding at that moment drew his attention to his business of the day to pitch  his work that day reminded me of the first game he ever pitched for me upon which occasion captain spears got the best out of him by making him angry  for several innings providence was helpless before his delivery  then something happened that showed me a crisis was near  a wag of a fan yelled from the bleachers  honeymoon rube  this cry was taken up by the delighted fans and it rolled around the field  but the rube pitched on harder than ever  then the knowing bleacherite who had started the cry changed it somewhat  nannys rube he yelled  this too went the rounds and still the rube though red in the face preserved his temper and his pitching control  all would have been well if bud wiler comedian of the providence team had not hit upon a way to rattle rube  nannys goat he shouted from the coaching lines  every providence player took it up  the rube was not proof against that  he yelled so fiercely at them and glared so furiously and towered so formidably that they ceased for the moment  then he let drive with his fast straight ball and hit the first providence batter in the ribs  his comrades had to help him to the bench  the rube hit the next batter on the leg and judging from the crack of the ball i fancied that player would walk lame for several days the rube tried to hit the next batter and sent him to first on balls  thereafter it became a dodging contest with honors about equal between pitcher and batters  the providence players stormed and the bleachers roared  but i would not take the rube out and the game went on with the rube forcing in runs  with the score a tie and three men on bases one of the players on the bench again yelled nannys goat  straight as a string the rube shot the ball at this fellow and bounded after it  the crowd rose in an uproar  the base runners began to score i left my bench and ran across the space but not in time to catch the rube  i saw him hit two or three of the providence men then the policemen got to him and a real fight brought the big audience into the stamping melee  before the rube was collared i saw at least four bluecoats on the grass  the game broke up and the crowd spilled itself in streams over the field  excitement ran high  i tried to force my way into the mass to get at the rube and the officers but this was impossible  i feared the rube would be taken from the officers and treated with violence so i waited with the surging crowd endeavoring to get nearer  soon we were in the street and it seemed as if all the stands had emptied their yelling occupants  a trolley car came along down the street splitting the mass of people and driving them back a dozen policemen summarily bundled the rube upon the rear end of the car  some of these officers boarded the car and some remained in the street to beat off the vengeful fans  i saw some one thrust forward a frantic young woman  the officers stopped her then suddenly helped her on the car just as i started  i recognized nan  she gripped the rube with both hands and turned a white fearful face upon the angry crowd  the rube stood in the grasp of his wife and the policemen and he looked like a ruffled lion he shook his big fist and bawled in farreaching voice  i can lick you all  to my infinite relief the trolley gathered momentum and safely passed out of danger  the last thing i made out was nan pressing close to the rubes side  that moment saw their reconciliation and my joy that it was the end of the rubes honeymoon    the rubes waterloo  it was about the sixth inning that i suspected the rube of weakening for that matter he had not pitched anything resembling his usual brand of baseball  but the rube had developed into such a wonder in the box that it took time for his letdown to dawn upon me  also it took a tip from raddy who sat with me on the bench  con the rube isnt himself today said radbourne  his minds not on the game  he seems hurried and flustered too  if he doesnt explode presently im a dub at callin the turn  raddy was the best judge of a pitchers condition physical or mental in the eastern league it was a saturday and we were on the road and finishing up a series with the rochesters  each team had won and lost a game and as i was climbing close to the leaders in the pennant race i wanted the third and deciding game of that rochester series the usual big saturday crowd was in attendance noisy demonstrative and exacting  in this sixth inning the first man up for rochester had flied to mccall  then had come the two plays significant of rubes weakening he had hit one batter and walked another  this was sufficient considering the score was three to one in our favor to bring the audience to its feet with a howling stamping demand for runs  spears is wise all right said raddy  i watched the foxy old captain walk over to the rube and talk to him while he rested a reassuring hand on the pitchers shoulder  the crowd yelled its disapproval and umpire bates called out sharply  spears get back to the bag  now mister umpire aint i hurrin all i can queried spears as he leisurely ambled back to first  the rube tossed a long damp welt of hair back from his big brow and nervously toed the rubber i noted that he seemed to forget the runners on bases and delivered the ball without glancing at either bag  of course this resulted in a double steal  the ball went wildalmost a wild pitch  steady up old man called gregg between the yells of the bleachers he held his mitt square over the plate for the rube to pitch to  again the long twirler took his swing and again the ball went wild  clancy had the rube in the hole now and the situation began to grow serious the rube did not take half his usual deliberation and of the next two pitches one of them was a ball and the other a strike by grace of the umpires generosity  clancy rapped the next one an absurdly slow pitch for the rube to use and both runners scored to the shrill tune of the happy bleachers  i saw spears shake his head and look toward the bench  it was plain what that meant  raddy i ought to take the rube out i said but whom can i put in you worked yesterdaycairns arm is sore  its got to be nursed and henderson that ladies man i just signed is not in uniform  ill go in replied raddy instantly  not on your life  i had as hard a time keeping radbourne from overworking as i had in getting enough work out of some other players i guess ill let the rube take his medicine  i hate to lose this game but if we have to we can stand it  im curious anyway to see whats the matter with the rube  maybe hell settle down presently  i made no sign that i had noticed spears appeal to the bench  and my aggressive players no doubt seeing the situation as i saw it sang out their various calls of cheer to the rube and of defiance to their antagonists  clancy stole off first base so far that the rube catching somebodys warning too late made a balk and the umpire sent the runner on to second  the rube now plainly showed painful evidences of being rattled  he could not locate the plate without slowing up and when he did that a rochester player walloped the ball  pretty soon he pitched as if he did not care and but for the fast fielding of the team behind him the rochesters would have scored more than the eight runs it got  when the rube came in to the bench i asked him if he was sick and at first he said he was and then that he was not  so i let him pitch the remaining innings as the game was lost anyhow and we walked off the field a badly beaten team  that night we had to hurry from the hotel to catch a train for worcester and we had dinner in the diningcar  several of my players wives had come over from worcester to meet us and were in the diningcar when i entered  i observed a pretty girl sitting at one of the tables with my new pitcher henderson  say mac i said to mccall who was with me is henderson married  naw but he looks like he wanted to be  he was in the grand stand today with that girl  who is she  oh a little peach  a second glance at hendersons companion brought this compliment from me involuntarily  con youll get it as bad as the rest of this mushy bunch of ball players  were all stuck on that kid  but since henderson came shes been a frost to all of us  an its put the rube in the dumps  whos the girl  thats nan brown  she lives in worcester an is the craziest girl fan i ever seen  flirt well shes got them all beat  somebody introduced the rube to her  he has been mooney ever since  that was enough to whet my curiosity and i favored miss brown with more than one glance during dinner  when we returned to the parlor car i took advantage of the opportunity and remarked to henderson that he might introduce his manager  he complied but not with amiable grace  so i chatted with nan brown and studied her she was a pretty laughing coquettish little minx and quite baseball mad  i had met many girl fans but none so enthusiastic as nan  but she was wholesome and sincere and i liked her  before turning in i sat down beside the rube he was very quiet and his face did not encourage company  but that did not stop me  hello whit have a smoke before you go to bed i asked cheerfully  he scarcely heard me and made no move to take the proffered cigar  all at once it struck me that the rustic simplicity which had characterized him had vanished  whit old fellow what was wrong today i asked quietly with my hand on his arm  mr connelly i want my release i want to go back to rickettsville he replied hurriedly  for the space of a few seconds i did some tall thinking  the situation suddenly became grave i saw the pennant for the worcesters fading dimming  you want to go home i began slowly why whit i cant keep you  i wouldnt try if you didnt want to stay  but ill tell you confidentially if you leave me at this stage im ruined  hows that he inquired keenly looking at me  well i cant win the pennant without you  if i do win it theres a big bonus for me  i can buy the house i want and get married this fall if i capture the flag  youve met milly  you can imagine what your pitching means to me this year  thats all  he averted his face and looked out of the window his big jaw quivered  if its thatwhy ill stay i reckon he said huskily  that moment bound whit hurtle and frank connelly into a far closer relation than the one between player and manager  i sat silent for a while listening to the drowsy talk of the other players and the rush and roar of the train as it sped on into the night  thank you old chap i replied  it wouldnt have been like you to throw me down at this stage  whit youre in trouble  yes  can i help youin any way  i reckon not  dont be too sure of that  im a pretty wise guy if i do say it myself  i might be able to do as much for you as youre going to do for me  the sight of his face convinced me that i had taken a wrong tack  it also showed me how deep whits trouble really was  i bade him good night and went to my berth where sleep did not soon visit me  a saucy sparklingeyed woman barred whit hurtles baseball career at its threshold  women are just as fatal to ball players as to men in any other walk of life  i had seen a strong athlete grow palsied just at a scornful slight  its a great world and the women run it  so i lay awake racking my brains to outwit a pretty disorganizer and i plotted for her sake  married she would be out of mischief  for whits sake for millys sake for mine all of which collectively meant for the sake of the pennant this would be the solution of the problem  i decided to take milly into my confidence and finally on the strength of that i got to sleep  in the morning i went to my hotel had breakfast attended to my mail and then boarded a car to go out to millys house  she was waiting for me on the porch dressed as i liked to see her in blue and white and she wore violets that matched the color of her eyes  hello connie  i havent seen a morning paper but i know from your face that you lost the rochester series said milly with a gay laugh  i guess yes  the rube blew up and if we dont play a pretty smooth game young lady hell never come down  then i told her  why connie i knew long ago  havent you seen the change in him before this  what change i asked blankly  you are a man  well he was a gawky slouchy shy farmer boy when he came to us  of course the city life and popularity began to influence him  then he met nan  she made the rube a worshipper  i first noticed a change in his clothes  he blossomed out in a new suit white negligee neat tie and a stylish straw hat then it was evident he was making heroic struggles to overcome his awkwardness  it was plain he was studying and copying the other boys hes wonderfully improved but still shy  hell always be shy  connie whits a fine fellow too good for nan brown  but milly i interrupted the rubes hard hit  why is he too good for her  nan is a naturalborn flirt milly replied she cant help it  im afraid whit has a slim chance  nan may not see deep enough to learn his fine qualities  i fancy nan tired quickly of him though the one time i saw them together she appeared to like him very well  this new pitcher of yours henderson is a handsome fellow and smooth  whit is losing to him  nan likes flash flattery excitement  mccall told me the rube had been down in the mouth ever since henderson joined the team milly i dont like henderson a whole lot hes not in the rubes class as a pitcher  what am i going to do lose the pennant and a big slice of purse money just for a pretty little flirt  oh connie its not so bad as that  whit will come around all right  he wont unless we can pull some wires  ive got to help him win nan brown  what do you think of that for a managers job  i guess maybe winning pennants doesnt call for diplomatic genius and cunning  but ill hand them a few tricks before i lose  my first move will be to give henderson his release  i left milly as always once more able to make light of discouragements and difficulties  monday i gave henderson his unconditional release  he celebrated the occasion by verifying certain rumors i had heard from other managers he got drunk  but he did not leave town and i heard that he was negotiating with providence for a place on that team  radbourne pitched one of his giltedged games that afternoon against hartford and we won and milly sat in the grand stand having contrived by cleverness to get a seat next to nan brown  milly and i were playing a vastly deeper game than baseballa game with hearts  but we were playing it with honest motive for the good of all concerned we believed and on the square i sneaked a look now and then up into the grand stand  milly and nan appeared to be getting on famously  it was certain that nan was flushed and excited no doubt consciously proud of being seen with my affianced  after the game i chanced to meet them on their way out  milly winked at me which was her sign that all was working beautifully  i hunted up the rube and bundled him off to the hotel to take dinner with me  at first he was glum but after a while he brightened up somewhat to my persistent cheer and friendliness then we went out on the hotel balcony to smoke and there i made my play  whit im pulling a stroke for you  now listen and dont be offended i know whats put you off your feed because i was the same way when milly had me guessing  youve lost your head over nan brown  thats not so terrible though i daresay you think its a catastrophe because youve quit  youve shown a yellow streak youve lain down  my boy that isnt the way to win a girl youve got to scrap  milly told me yesterday how she had watched your love affairs with nan and how she thought you had given up just when things might have come your way  nan is a little flirt but shes all right  whats more she was getting fond of you  nan is meanest to the man she likes best  the way to handle her whit is to master her  play high and mighty  get tragical  then grab her up in your arms  i tell you whit itll all come your way if you only keep your nerve  im your friend and so is milly were going out to her house presentlyand nan will be there  the rube drew a long deep breath and held out his hand  i sensed another stage in the evolution of whit hurtle  i reckon ive taken baseball coachin he said presently an i dont see why i cant take some other kind  im only a rube an things come hard for me but im alearnin  it was about dark when we arrived at the house  hello connie  youre late  good evening mr hurtle  come right in  youve met miss nan brown  oh of course how stupid of me  it was a trying moment for milly and me  a little pallor showed under the rubes tan but he was more composed than i had expected  nan got up from the piano  she was all in white and deliciously pretty  she gave a quick glad start of surprise  what a relief that was to my troubled mind  everything had depended upon a real honest liking for whit and she had it  more than once i had been proud of millys cleverness but this night as hostess and an accomplice she won my everlasting admiration she contrived to give the impression that whit was a frequent visitor at her home and very welcome  she brought out his best points and in her skillful hands he lost embarrassment and awkwardness before the evening was over nan regarded whit with different eyes and she never dreamed that everything had not come about naturally  then milly somehow got me out on the porch leaving nan and whit together  milly youre a marvel the best and sweetest ever i whispered were going to win  its a cinch  well connie not thatexactly she whispered back demurely  but it looks hopeful  i could not help hearing what was said in the parlor  now i can roast you nan was saying archly she had switched back to her favorite baseball vernacular  you pitched a swell game last saturday in rochester didnt you  not  you had no steam no control and you couldnt have curved a saucer  nan what could you expect was the cool reply  you sat up in the stand with your handsome friend  i reckon i couldnt pitch  i just gave the game away  whitwhit  then i whispered to milly that it might be discreet for us to move a little way from the vicinity  it was on the second day afterward that i got a chance to talk to nan she reached the grounds early before milly arrived and i found her in the grand stand  the rube was down on the card to pitch and when he started to warm up nan said confidently that he would shut out hartford that afternoon  im sorry nan but youre way off  wed do well to win at all let alone get a shutout  youre a fine manager she retorted hotly why wont we win  well the rubes not in good form  the rube  stop calling him that horrid name  whits not in shape  hes not right  hes ill or something is wrong im worried sick about him  whymr connelly exclaimed nan  she turned quickly toward me  i crowded on full canvas of gloom to my already long face  im serious nan  the lads off somehow hes in magnificent physical trim but he cant keep his mind on the game  he has lost his head ive talked with him reasoned with him all to no good  he only goes down deeper in the dumps something is terribly wrong with him and if he doesnt brace ill have to release  miss nan brown suddenly lost a little of her rich bloom  oh you wouldntyou couldnt release him  ill have to if he doesnt brace  it means a lot to me nan for of course i cant win the pennant this year without whit being in shape but i believe i wouldnt mind the loss of that any more than to see him fall down  the boy is a magnificent pitcher  if he can only be brought around hell go to the big league next year and develop into one of the greatest pitchers the game has ever produced  but somehow or other he has lost heart  hes quit  and ive done my best for him hes beyond me now  what a shame it is  for hes the making of such a splendid man outside of baseball  milly thinks the world of him well well there are disappointmentswe cant help them  there goes the gong  i must leave you  nan ill bet you a box of candy whit loses today  is it a go  it is replied nan with fire in her eyes you go to whit hurtle and tell him i said if he wins todays game ill kiss him  i nearly broke my neck over benches and bats getting to whit with that message  he gulped once  then he tightened his belt and shut out hartford with two scratch singles  it was a great exhibition of pitching  i had no means to tell whether or not the rube got his reward that night but i was so happy that i hugged milly within an inch of her life  but it turned out that i had been a little premature in my elation  in two days the rube went down into the depths again this time clear to china and nan was sitting in the grand stand with henderson  the rube lost his next game pitching like a schoolboy scared out of his wits henderson followed nan like a shadow so that i had no chance to talk to her  the rube lost his next game and then another  we were pushed out of second place  if we kept up that losing streak a little longer our hopes for the pennant were gone  i had begun to despair of the rube  for some occult reason he scarcely spoke to me  nan flirted worse than ever it seemed to me she flaunted her conquest of henderson in poor whits face  the providence ball team came to town and promptly signed henderson and announced him for saturdays game  cairns won the first of the series and radbourne lost the second  it was rubes turn to pitch the saturday game and i resolved to make one more effort to put the lovesick swain in something like his old fettle  so i called upon nan  she was surprised to see me but received me graciously  i fancied her face was not quite so glowing as usual  i came bluntly out with my mission  she tried to freeze me but i would not freeze  i was out to win or lose and not to be lightly laughed aside or coldly denied  i played to make her angry knowing the real truth of her feelings would show under stress  for once in my life i became a knocker and said some unpleasant thingsalbeit they were trueabout henderson  she championed henderson royally and when as a last card i compared whits fine record with hendersons not only as a ball player but as a man particularly in his reverence for women she flashed at me  what do you know about it  mr henderson asked me to marry him  can a man do more to show his respect  your friend never so much as hinted such honorable intentions  whats morehe insulted me  the blaze in nans black eyes softened with a film of tears  she looked hurt  her pride had encountered a fall  oh no nan whit couldnt insult a lady i protested  couldnt he  thats all you know about him you know ii promised to kiss him if he beat hartford that day  so when he came ii did then the big savage began to rave and he grabbed me up in his arms  he smothered me almost crushed the life out of me  he frightened me terribly  when i got away from himthe monster stood there and coolly said i belonged to him  i ran out of the room and wouldnt see him any more  at first i might have forgiven him if he had apologizedsaid he was sorry but never a word  now i never will forgive him  i had to make a strenuous effort to conceal my agitation  the rube had most carefully taken my fool advice in the matter of wooing a woman  when i had got a hold upon myself i turned to nan whitehot with eloquence  now i was talking not wholly for myself or the pennant but for this boy and girl who were at odds in that strangest game of lifelove  what i said i never knew but nan lost her resentment and then her scorn and indifference slowly she thawed and warmed to my reason praise whatever it was and when i stopped she was again the radiant bewildering nan of old  take another message to whit for me she said audaciously  tell him i adore ball players especially pitchers  tell him im going to the game today to choose the best one  if he loses the game  she left the sentence unfinished  in my state of mind i doubted not in the least that she meant to marry the pitcher who won the game and so i told the rube  he made one wild upheaval of his arms and shoulders like an erupting volcano which proved to me that he believed it too  when i got to the bench that afternoon i was tired  there was a big crowd to see the game the weather was perfect milly sat up in the box and waved her score card at me raddy and spears declared we had the game the rube stalked to and fro like an implacable indian chiefbut i was not happy in mind  calamity breathed in the very air  the game began  mccall beat out a bunt ashwell sacrificed and stringer laced one of his beautiful triples against the fence  then he scored on a high fly  two runs  worcester trotted out into the field the rube was white with determination he had the speed of a bullet and perfect control of his jump ball and drop  but providence hit and had the luck  ashwell fumbled gregg threw wild  providence tied the score  the game progressed growing more and more of a nightmare to me  it was not worcesters day  the umpire could not see straight the boys grumbled and fought among themselves spears roasted the umpire and was sent to the bench bogart tripped hurting his sore ankle and had to be taken out  hendersons slow easy ball baffled my players and when he used speed they lined it straight at a providence fielder  in the sixth after a desperate rally we crowded the bases with only one out  then mullaneys hard rap to left seemingly good for three bases was pulled down by stone with one hand  it was a wonderful catch and he doubled up a runner at second  again in the seventh we had a chance to score only to fail on another double play this time by the infield  when the providence players were at bat their luck not only held good but trebled and quadrupled  the little texasleague hits dropped safely just out of reach of the infielders  my boys had an off day in fielding  what horror that of all days in a season this should be the one for them to make errors  but they were game and the rube was the gamest of all  he did not seem to know what hard luck was or discouragement or poor support he kept everlastingly hammering the ball at those lucky providence hitters  what speed he had  the ball streaked in and somebody would shut his eyes and make a safety  but the rube pitched on tireless irresistibly hopeful not forgetting to call a word of cheer to his fielders  it was one of those strange games that could not be bettered by any labor or daring or skill i saw it was lost from the second inning yet so deeply was i concerned so tantalizingly did the plays reel themselves off that i groveled there on the bench unable to abide by my baseball sense  the ninth inning proved beyond a shadow of doubt how baseball fate in common with other fates loved to balance the chances to lift up one then the other to lend a deceitful hope only to dash it away  providence had almost three times enough to win  the team let up in that inning or grew overconfident or careless and before we knew what had happened some scratch hits and bases on balls and errors gave us three runs and left two runners on bases  the disgusted bleachers came out of their gloom and began to whistle and thump  the rube hit safely sending another run over the plate  mccall worked his old trick beating out a slow bunt  bases full three runs to tie  with ashwell up and one out the noise in the bleachers mounted to a highpitched shrill continuous sound i got up and yelled with all my might and could not hear my voice ashwell was a dangerous man in a pinch  the game was not lost yet  a hit anything to get ash to firstand then stringer  ash laughed at henderson taunted him shook his bat at him and dared him to put one over henderson did not stand under fire  the ball he pitched had no steam  ash cracked itsquare on the line into the shortstops hands  the bleachers ceased yelling  then stringer strode grimly to the plate  it was a hundred to one in that instance that he would lose the ball  the bleachers let out one deafening roar then hushed  i would rather have had stringer at the bat than any other player in the world and i thought of the rube and nan and millyand hope would not die  stringer swung mightily on the first pitch and struck the ball with a sharp solid bing  it shot toward center low level exceedingly swift and like a dark streak went straight into the fielders hands a rod to right or left would have made it a home run  the crowd strangled a victorious yell  i came out of my trance for the game was over and lost  it was the rubes waterloo  i hurried him into the dressing room and kept close to him  he looked like a man who had lost the one thing worth while in his life  i turned a deaf ear to my players to everybody and hustled the rube out and to the hotel  i wanted to be near him that night  to my amaze we met milly and nan as we entered the lobby  milly wore a sweet sympathetic smile  nan shone more radiant than ever i simply stared  it was milly who got us all through the corridor into the parlor  i heard nan talking  whit you pitched a bad game but there was the old teasing arch coquettishnessbut you are the best pitcher  nan  yes    breaking into fast company  they may say baseball is the same in the minor leagues that it is in the big leagues but any old ball player or manager knows better where the difference comes in however is in the greater excellence and unity of the major players a speed a daring a finish that can be acquired only in competition with one another  i thought of this when i led my party into morriseys private box in the grand stand of the chicago american league grounds  we had come to see the rubes break into fast company my great pitcher whittaker hurtle the rube as we called him had won the eastern league pennant for me that season and morrisey the chicago magnate had bought him milly my affianced was with me looking as happy as she was pretty and she was chaperoned by her mother mrs nelson  with me also were two veterans of my team mccall and spears who lived in chicago and who would have traveled a few miles to see the rube pitch  and the other member of my party was mrs hurtle the rubes wife as saucy and as sparklingeyed as when she had been nan brown  today she wore a new tailormade gown new bonnet new glovesshe said she had decorated herself in a manner befitting the wife of a major league pitcher  morriseys box was very comfortable and as i was pleased to note so situated that we had a fine view of the field and stands and yet were comparatively secluded  the bleachers were filling some of the chicago players were on the field tossing and batting balls the rube however had not yet appeared  a moment later a metallic sound was heard on the stairs leading up into the box  i knew it for baseball spiked shoes clanking on the wood  the rube looking enormous in his uniform stalked into the box knocking over two chairs as he entered  he carried a fielders glove in one huge freckled hand and a big black bat in the other  nan with much dignity and a very manifest pride introduced him to mrs nelson  there was a little chatting and then upon the arrival of manager morrisey we men retired to the back of the box to talk baseball  chicago was in fourth place in the league race and had a fighting chance to beat detroit out for the third position  philadelphia was scheduled for that day and philadelphia had a great team it was leading the race and almost beyond all question would land the flag in truth only one more victory was needed to clinch the pennant the team had three games to play in chicago and it was to wind up the season with three in washington  six games to play and only one imperatively important to win  but baseball is uncertain and until the philadelphians won that game they would be a band of fiends  well whit this is where you break in i said  now tip us straight  youve had more than a weeks rest  hows that arm  grand con grand replied the rube with his frank smile  i was a little anxious till i warmed up  but say  ive got more up my sleeve today than i ever had  thatll do for me said morrisey rubbing his hands  ill spring something on these swelled quakers today  now connelly give hurtle one of your old talksthe last oneand then ill ring the gong  i added some words of encouragement not forgetting my old ruse to incite the rube by rousing his temper  and then as the gong rang and the rube was departing nan stepped forward for her say  there was a little white under the tan on her cheek and her eyes had a darkling flash  whit its a magnificent sightthat beautiful green field and the stands  what a crowd of fans  why i never saw a real baseball crowd before  there are twenty thousand here  and theres a difference in the feeling  its sharpernew to me  its big league baseball  not a soul in that crowd ever heard of you but i believe tomorrow the whole baseball world will have heard of you  mr morrisey knows  i saw it in his face  captain spears knows  connie knows  i know  then she lifted her face and pulling him down within reach she kissed him  nan took her husbands work in dead earnest she gloried in it and perhaps she had as much to do with making him a great pitcher as any of us  the rube left the box and i found a seat between nan and milly  the field was a splendid sight  those bleachers made me glow with managerial satisfaction  on the field both teams pranced and danced and bounced around in practice  in spite of the absolutely last degree of egotism manifested by the philadelphia players i could not but admire such a splendid body of men  so these are the champions of last season and of this season too commented milly  i dont wonder  how swiftly and cleanly they play they appear not to exert themselves yet they always get the ball in perfect time  it all reminds me ofof the rhythm of music  and that champion batter and runnerthat lane in centerisnt he just beautiful  he walks and runs like a blueribbon winner at the horse show  i tell you one thing connie these quakers are on dress parade  oh these quakers hate themselves i dont think retorted nan being a rabid girlfan it was of course impossible for nan to speak baseball convictions or gossip without characteristic baseball slang stuck on themselves  i never saw the like in my life  that fellow lane is so swelled that he cant get down off his toes  but hes a wonder i must admit that  theyre a bunch of stars  easy fast trainedtheyre machines and ill bet theyre indians to fight  i can see it sticking out all over them  this will certainly be some game with whit handing up that jump ball of his to this gang of champs but connie ill go you whit beats them  i laughed and refused to gamble  the gong rang the crowd seemed to hum and rustle softly to quiet attention umpire mcclung called the names of the batteries then the familiar play  there was the usual applause from the grand stand and welcome cheers from the bleachers the rube was the last player to go out morrisey was a manager who always played to the stands and no doubt he held the rube back for effect  if so he ought to have been gratified that moment reminded me of my own team and audience upon the occasion of the rubes debut it was the same only here it happened in the big league before a championship team and twenty thousand fans  the roar that went up from the bleachers might well have scared an unseasoned pitcher out of his wits  and the quakers lined up before their bench and gazed at this newcomer who had the nerve to walk out there to the box  cogswell stood on the coaching line looked at the rube and then held up both arms and turned toward the chicago bench as if to ask morrisey  where did you get that  nan quick as a flash to catch a point leaned over the boxrail and looked at the champions with fire in her eye  oh you just wait wait she bit out between her teeth  certain it was that there was no one who knew the rube as well as i and i knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that the hour before me would see brightening of a great star pitcher on the big league horizon  it was bound to be a full hour for me  i had much reason to be grateful to whit hurtle  he had pulled my team out of a rut and won me the pennant and the five thousand dollars i got for his release bought the little cottage on the hill for milly and me  then there was my pride in having developed him  and all that i needed to calm me settle me down into assurance and keen criticism of the game was to see the rube pitch a few balls with his old incomparable speed and control  berne first batter for the quakers walked up to the plate  he was another billy hamilton built like a wedge  i saw him laugh at the long pitcher  whit swayed back coiled and uncoiled  something thin white glancing shot at berne  he ducked escaping the ball by a smaller margin than appeared good for his confidence  he spoke low to the rube and what he said was probably not flavored with the milk of friendly sweetness  wild  whatd you look for called out cogswell scornfully  hes from the woods  the rube swung his enormously long arm took an enormous stride toward third base and pitched again  it was one of his queer deliveries the ball cut the plate  ho  ho yelled the quakers  the rubes next one was his out curve  it broke toward the corner of the plate and would have been a strike had not berne popped it up  callopy the second hitter faced the rube and he too after the manner of ball players made some remark meant only for the rubes ears callopy was a famous waiter  he drove more pitchers mad with his implacable patience than any hitter in the league  the first one of the rubes he waited on crossed the incorner the second crossed the outcorner and the third was rubes wide slow tantalizing stitchball as we call it for the reason that it came so slow a batter could count the stitches  i believe callopy waited on that curve decided to hit it changed his mind and waited some more and finally the ball maddened him and he had to poke at it the result being a weak grounder  then the graceful powerful lane champion batter champion base runner stepped to the plate  how a baseball crowd any crowd anywhere loves the champion batter  the ovation lane received made me wonder with this impressive reception in a hostile camp what could be the manner of it on his home field  any boy ballplayer from the lots seeing lane knock the dirt out of his spikes and step into position would have known he was a 400 hitter  i was curious to see what the rube would pitch lane  it must have been a new and significant moment for hurtle  some pitchers actually wilt when facing a hitter of lanes reputation  but he on his baseball side was peculiarly unemotional undoubtedly he could get furious but that only increased his effectiveness  to my amazement the rube pitched lane a little easy ball not in any sense like his floater or stitchball but just a little toss that any youngster might have tossed of all possible balls lane was not expecting such as that and he let it go  if the nerve of it amazed me what did it not do to lane  i saw his face go fiery red  the grand stand murmured let out one short yelp of pleasure the quaker players chaffed lane  the pitch was a strike  i was gripping my chair now and for the next pitch i prophesied the rubes wonderful jump ball which he had not yet used  he swung long and at the end of his swing seemed to jerk tensely  i scarcely saw the ball it had marvelous speed  lane did not offer to hit it and it was a strike  he looked at the rube then at cogswell  that veteran appeared amused the bleachers happy and surprised to be able to yell at lane yelled heartily  again i took it upon myself to interpret the rubes pitching mind  he had another ball that he had not used a drop an unhittable drop  i thought he would use that next  he did and though lane reached it with the bat the hit was a feeble one  he had been fooled and the side was out  poole the best of the quakers pitching staff walked out to the slab he was a lefthander and chicago having so many players who batted lefthanded always found a southpaw a hard nut to crack  cogswell field manager and captain of the quakers kicked up the dust around first base and yelled to his men  git in the game  staats hit pooles speed ball into deep short and was out mitchell flew out to berne rand grounded to second  while the teams again changed sides the fans cheered and then indulged in the first stretch of the game  i calculated that they would be stretching their necks presently trying to keep track of the rubes work  nan leaned on the railing absorbed in her own hope and faith milly chattered about this and that people in the boxes and the chances of the game  my own interest while it did not wholly preclude the fortunes of the chicago players at the bat was mostly concerned with the rubes fortunes in the field  in the rubes half inning he retired bannister and blandy on feeble infield grounders and worked cogswell into hitting a wide curve high in the air  poole meant to win for the quakers if his good arm and cunning did not fail him and his pitching was masterly  mccloskey fanned hutchinson fouled out brewster got a short safe fly just out of reach and hoffner hit to second forcing brewster  with dugan up for the quakers in the third inning cogswell and bannister from the coaching lines began to talk to the rube  my ears keen from long practice caught some of the remarks in spite of the noisy bleachers  say busher you ve lasted longern we expected but you dont know it  gol darn you city ball tossers  now you jest let me alone  were comin through the rye  my topheavy rustic friend youll need an airship presently when you go up  all the badinage was goodnatured which was sure proof that the quakers had not arrived at anything like real appreciation of the rube they were accustomed to observe the trying out of many youngsters of whom ninetynine out of a hundred failed to make good  dugan chopped at three strikes and slammed his bat down  hucker hit a slow fly to hoffer three men out on five pitched balls  cogswell old war horse that he was stood a full moment and watched the rube as he walked in to the bench  an idea had penetrated cogswells brain and i would have given something to know what it was  cogswell was a great baseball general and though he had a preference for matured ballplayers he could when pressed see the quality in a youngster he picked up his mitt and took his position at first with a gruff word to his players  rand for chicago opened with a hit and the bleachers ready to strike fire began to cheer and stamp  when mccloskey in an attempt to sacrifice beat out his bunt the crowd roared  rand being slow on his feet had not attempted to make third on the play  hutchinson sacrificed neatly advancing the runners  then the bleachers played the long rolling drum of clattering feet with shrill whistling accompaniment  brewster batted a wicked ground ball to blandy  he dove into the dust came up with the ball and feinting to throw home he wheeled and shot the ball to cogswell who in turn shot it to the plate to head rand  runner and ball got there apparently together but umpire mcclungs decision went against rand  it was fine fast work but how the bleachers stormed at mcclung  robbber  again the head of the quakers formidable list was up  i knew from the way that cogswell paced the coaching box that the word had gone out to look the rube over seriously  there were possibilities even in rubes  berne carefully stepped into the batters box as if he wanted to be certain to the breadth of a hair how close he was to the plate  he was there this time to watch the rube pitch to work him out to see what was what  he crouched low and it would have been extremely hard to guess what he was up to  his great play however was his ability to dump the ball and beat out the throw to first  it developed presently that this was now his intention and that the rube knew it and pitched him the one ball which is almost impossible to bunta high incurve over the inside corner there was no mistaking the rubes magnificent control  true as a plumb line he shot up the ballonce twice and berne fouled bothtwo strikes  grudgingly he waited on the next but it too was over the corner and berne went out on strikes  the great crowd did not of course grasp the finesse of the play but berne had struck outthat was enough for them  callopy the famous spiker who had put many a player out of the game for weeks at a time strode into the batters place and he too was not at the moment making any funny remarks  the rube delivered a ball that all but hit callopy fair on the head  it was the second narrow escape for him and the roar he let out showed how he resented being threatened with a little of his own medicine  as might have been expected and very likely as the rube intended callopy hit the next ball a sweeping curve up over the infield  i was trying to see all the intricate details of the motive and action on the field and it was not easy to watch several players at once but while berne and callopy were having their troubles with the rube i kept the tail of my eye on cogswell  he was prowling up and down the thirdbase line  he was missing no signs no indications no probabilities no possibilities  but he was in doubt  like a hawk he was watching the rube and as well the crafty batters  the inning might not tell the truth as to the rubes luck though it would test his control  the rubes speed and curves without any head work would have made him a pitcher of no mean ability but was this remarkable placing of balls just accident  that was the question  when berne walked to the bench i distinctly heard him say  come out of it you dubs  i say you cant work him or wait him  hes peggin em out of a gun  several of the quakers were standing out from the bench all intent on the rube  he had stirred them up  first it was humor then ridicule curiosity suspicion doubt  and i knew it would grow to wonder and certainty then fierce attack from both tongues and bats and lastlyfor ball players are generousunstinted admiration  somehow not only the first climaxes of a game but the decisions the convictions the reputations of pitchers and fielders evolve around the great hitter  plain it was that the vast throng of spectators eager to believe in a new find wild to welcome a new star yet loath to trust to their own impulsive judgments held themselves in check until once more the great lane had faced the rube  the field grew tolerably quiet just then  the rube did not exert himself  the critical stage had no concern for him  he pitched lane a high curve over the plate but in close a ball meant to be hit and a ball hard to hit safely  lane knew that as well as any hitter in the world so he let two of the curves go bytwo strikes  again the rube relentlessly gave him the same ball and lane hitting viciously spitefully because he did not want to hit that kind of a ball sent up a fly that rand easily captured  oh i dont know  pretty fair i guess yelled a tenorvoiced fan and he struck the keynote  and the bleachers rose to their feet and gave the rube the rousing cheer of the brotherhood of fans  hoffer walked to first on a base on balls sweeney advanced him  the rube sent up a giant fly to callopy  then staats hit safely scoring the first run of the game  hoffer crossed the plate amid vociferous applause  mitchell ended the inning with a fly to blandy  what a change had come over the spirit of that quaker aggregation  it was something to make a man thrill with admiration and if he happened to favor chicago to fire all his fighting blood the players poured upon the rube a continuous stream of scathing abuse  they would have made a raging devil of a mildmannered clergyman some of them were skilled in caustic wit most of them were possessed of forked tongues and cogswell he of a thousand baseball battles had a genius for inflaming anyone he tormented  this was mostly beyond the ken of the audience and behind the back of the umpire but it was perfectly plain to me  the quakers were trying to rattle the rube a trick of the game as fair for one side as for the other  i sat there tight in my seat grimly glorying in the way the rube refused to be disturbed  but the lion in him was rampant fortunately it was his strange gift to pitch better the angrier he got and the more the quakers flayed him the more he let himself out to their crushing humiliation  the innings swiftly passed to the eighth with chicago failing to score again with philadelphia failing to score at all  one scratch hit and a single gifts to the weak end of the batting list were all the lank pitcher allowed them  long since the bleachers had crowned the rube he was theirs and they were his and their voices had the peculiar strangled hoarseness due to overexertion the grand stand slower to understand and approve arrived later but it got there about the seventh and ladies gloves and mens hats were sacrificed  in the eighth the quakers reluctantly yielded their meed of praise showing it by a cessation of their savage wordy attacks on the rube it was a kind of sullen respect wrung from the bosom of great foes  then the ninth inning was at hand  as the sides changed i remembered to look at the feminine group in our box  milly was in a most beautiful glow of happiness and excitement  nan sat rigid leaning over the rail her face white and drawn and she kept saying in a low voice will it never end  will it never end  mrs nelson stared wearily  it was the quakers last stand  they faced it as a team that had won many a game in the ninth with two men out  dugan could do nothing with the rubes unhittable drop for a drop curve was his weakness and he struck out  hucker hit to hoffer who fumbled making the first error of the game  poole dumped the ball as evidently the rube desired for he handed up a straight one but the bunt rolled teasingly and the rube being big and tall failed to field it in time  suddenly the whole field grew quiet  for the first time cogswells coaching was clearly heard  one out  take a lead  take a lead  go through this time  go through  could it be possible i wondered that after such a wonderful exhibition of pitching the rube would lose out in the ninth  there were two quakers on base one out and two of the best hitters in the league on deck with a chance of lane getting up  oh  oh  oh moaned nan  i put my hand on hers  dont quit nan youll never forgive yourself if you quit  take it from me whit will pull out of this hole  what a hole that was for the rube on the day of his break into fast company  i measured it by his remarkable deliberation  he took a long time to get ready to pitch to berne and when he let drive it was as if he had been trifling all before in that game  i could think of no way to figure it except that when the ball left him there was scarcely any appreciable interval of time before it cracked in sweeneys mitt  it was the rubes drop which i believed unhittable  berne let it go by shaking his head as mcclung called it a strike  another followed which berne chopped at vainly  then with the same upheaval of his giant frame the same flinging of long arms and lunging forward the rube delivered a third drop and berne failed to hit it  the voiceless bleachers stamped on the benches and the grand stand likewise thundered  callopy showed his craft by stepping back and lining rubes high pitch to left  hoffer leaped across and plunged down getting his gloved hand in front of the ball  the hit was safe but hoffers valiant effort saved a tie score  lane up  three men on bases  two out  not improbably there were many thousand spectators of that thrilling moment who pitied the rube for the fate which placed lane at the bat then  but i was not one of them  nevertheless my throat was clogged my mouth dry and my ears full of bells  i could have done something terrible to hurtle for his deliberation yet i knew he was proving himself what i had always tried to train him to be  then he swung stepped out and threw his body with the ball  this was his rarely used pitch his last resort his fast rise ball that jumped up a little at the plate  lane struck under it  how significant on the instant to see old cogswells hands go up  again the rube pitched and this time lane watched the ball go by  two strikes  that whole audience leaped to its feet whispering yelling screaming roaring bawling  the rube received the ball from sweeney and quick as lightning he sped it plateward  the great lane struck out  the game was overchicago 1 philadelphia 0  in that whirling moment when the crowd went mad and milly was hugging me and nan pounding holes in my hat i had a queer sort of blankness a section of time when my sensations were deadlocked  oh  connie look cried nan  i saw lane and cogswell warmly shaking hands with the rube  then the hungry clamoring fans tumbled upon the field and swarmed about the players  whereupon nan kissed me and milly and then kissed mrs nelson  in that radiant moment nan was all sweetness  it is the rubes break into fast company she said    the knocker  yes carroll i got my notice  maybe its no surprise to you  and theres one more thing i want to say  youre it on this team youre the topnotch catcher in the western league and one of the best ball players in the gamebut youre a knocker  madge ellston heard young sheldon speak she saw the flash in his gray eyes and the heat of his bronzed face as he looked intently at the big catcher  fade away sonny  back to the bushleague for yours replied carroll derisively  youre not fast enough for kansas city  you look pretty good in a uniform and youre swift on your feet but you cant hit  youve got a glass arm and you run bases like an ostrich trying to side  that notice was coming to you  go learn the game  then a crowd of players trooped noisily out of the hotel lobby and swept sheldon and carroll down the porch steps toward the waiting omnibus  madges uncle owned the kansas city club she had lived most of her nineteen years in a baseball atmosphere but accustomed as she was to baseball talk and the peculiar banterings and bickerings of the players there were times when it seemed all greek  if a player got his notice it meant he would be released in ten days  a knocker was a ball player who spoke ill of his fellow players  this scrap of conversation however had an unusual interest because carroll had paid court to her for a year and sheldon coming to the team that spring had fallen desperately in love with her  she liked sheldon pretty well but carroll fascinated her  she began to wonder if there were bad feelings between the rivalsto compare themto get away from herself and judge them impersonally  when pat donahue the veteran manager of the team came out madge greeted him with a smile  she had always gotten on famously with pat notwithstanding her imperious desire to handle the managerial reins herself upon occasions pat beamed all over his round ruddy face  miss madge you werent to the park yesterday an we lost without our pretty mascot  we shure needed you  denvers playin at a fast clip  im coming out today replied miss ellston thoughtfully  pat whats a knocker  now miss madge are you askin me that after ive been coachin you in baseball for years questioned pat in distress  i know what a knocker is as everybody else does  but i want to know the real meaning the insideball of it to use your favorite saying  studying her grave face with shrewd eyes donahue slowly lost his smile  the insideball of it eh  come lets sit over here a bitthe suns shure warm today miss madge a knocker is the strangest man known in the game the hardest to deal with an what every baseball manager hates most  donahue told her that he believed the term knocker came originally from baseball that in general it typified the player who strengthened his own standing by belittling the ability of his teammates and by enlarging upon his own superior qualities  but there were many phases of this peculiar type  some players were natural born knockers others acquired the name in their later years in the game when younger men threatened to win their places  some of the best players ever produced by baseball had the habit in its most violent form  there were players of ridiculously poor ability who held their jobs on the strength of this one trait  it was a mystery how they misled magnates and managers alike how for months they held their places weakening a team often keeping a good team down in the race all from sheer bold suggestion of their own worth and other players worthlessness strangest of all was the knockers power to disorganize to engender a bad spirit between management and team and among the players the team which was without one of the parasites of the game generally stood well up in the race for the pennant though there had been championship teams noted for great knockers as well as great players  its shure strange miss madge said pat in conclusion shaking his gray head  ive played hundreds of knockers an released them too knockers always get it in the end but they go on foolin me and workin me just the same as if i was a youngster with my first team theyre part an parcel of the game  do you like these men off the fieldoutside of baseball i mean  no i shure dont an i never seen one yet that wasnt the same off the field as he was on  thank you pat  i think i understand now andoh yes theres another thing i want to ask you  whats the matter with billie sheldon uncle george said he was falling off in his game then ive read the papers  billie started out well in the spring  didnt he  i was sure thinkin i had a find in billie  well hes lost his nerve  hes in a bad slump  its worried me for days  im goin to release billie  the team needs a shakeup thats where billie gets the worst of it for hes really the makin of a star but hes slumped an now knockin has made him let down  there miss madge thats an example of what ive just been tellin you  an you can see that a manager has his troubles  these hulkin athletes are a lot of spoiled babies an i often get sick of my job  that afternoon miss ellston was in a brown study all the way out to the baseball park  she arrived rather earlier than usual to find the grandstand empty  the denver team had just come upon the field and the kansas city players were practising batting at the left of the diamond madge walked down the aisle of the grand stand and out along the reporters boxes  she asked one of the youngsters on the field to tell mr sheldon that she would like to speak with him a moment  billie eagerly hurried from the players bench with a look of surprise and expectancy on his suntanned face  madge experienced for the first time a sudden sense of shyness at his coming  his lithe form and his nimble step somehow gave her a pleasure that seemed old yet was new when he neared her and lifting his cap spoke her name the shade of gloom in his eyes and lines of trouble on his face dispelled her confusion  billie pat tells me hes given you ten days notice she said  its true  whats wrong with you billie  oh ive struck a bad streakcant hit or throw  are you a quitter  no im not he answered quickly flushing a dark red  you started off this spring with a rush  you played brilliantly and for a while led the team in batting  uncle george thought so well of you then came this spell of bad form  but billie its only a slump you can brace  i dont know he replied despondently awhile back i got my mind off the game  thenpeople who dont like me have taken advantage of my slump to  to knock interrupted miss ellston  im not saying that he said looking away from her  but im saying it  see here billie sheldon my uncle owns this team and pat donahue is manager i think they both like me a little  now i dont want to see you lose your place  perhaps  madge thats fine of youbut i thinki guess itd be best for me to leave kansas city  why  you know he said huskily  ive lost my headim in lovei cant think of baseballim crazy about you  miss ellstons sweet face grew rosy clear to the tips of her ears  billie sheldon she replied spiritedly youre talking nonsense even if you were were that way itd be no reason to play poor ball dont throw the game as pat would say make a brace  get up on your toes  tear things  rip the boards off the fence  dont quit  she exhausted her vocabulary of baseball language if not her enthusiasm and paused in blushing confusion  madge  will you brace up  will iwill i he exclaimed breathlessly  madge murmured a hurried goodbye and turning away went up the stairs  her uncles private box was upon the top of the grand stand and she reached it in a somewhat bewildered state of mind  she had a confused sense of having appeared to encourage billie and did not know whether she felt happy or guilty  the flame in his eyes had warmed all her blood  then as she glanced over the railing to see the powerful burns carroll there rose in her breast a panic at strange variance with her other feelings  many times had madge ellston viewed the field and stands and the outlying country from this high vantage point but never with the same mingling emotions nor had the sunshine ever been so golden the woods and meadows so green the diamond so smooth and velvety the whole scene so gaily bright  denver had always been a good drawing card and having won the first game of the present series bade fair to draw a record attendance the long lines of bleachers already packed with the familiar mottled crowd sent forth a merry rattling hum  soon a steady stream of welldressed men and women poured in the gates and up the grandstand stairs  the soft murmur of many voices in light conversation and laughter filled the air  the peanut venders and scorecard sellers kept up their insistent shrill cries  the baseball park was alive now and restless the atmosphere seemed charged with freedom and pleasure the players romped like skittish colts the fans shrieked their witticismsall sound and movements suggested play  madge ellston was somehow relieved to see her uncle sitting in one of the lower boxes  during this game she wanted to be alone and she believed she would be for the president of the league and directors of the kansas city team were with her uncle  when the bell rang to call the denver team in from practice the stands could hold no more and the ropedoff side lines were filling up with noisy men and boys  from her seat madge could see right down upon the players bench and when she caught both sheldon and carroll gazing upward she drew back with sharply contrasted thrills  then the bell rang again the bleachers rolled out their welcoming acclaim and play was called with kansas city at the bat  right off the reel hunt hit a short fly safely over second  the ten thousand spectators burst into a roar  a good start liberated applause and marked the feeling for the day  madge was surprised and glad to see billie sheldon start next for the plate  all season until lately he had been the second batter during his slump he had been relegated to the last place on the batting list  perhaps he had asked pat to try him once more at the top  the bleachers voiced their unstinted appreciation of this return showing that billie still had a strong hold on their hearts  as for madge her breast heaved and she had difficulty in breathing this was going to be a hard game for her  the intensity of her desire to see billie brace up to his old form amazed her and carrolls rude words beat thick in her ears never before had billie appeared so instinct with life so intent and strung as when he faced keene the denver pitcher  that worthy tied himself up in a knot and then unlimbering a long arm delivered the brand new ball  billie seemed to leap forward and throw his bat at it  there was a sharp ringing crackand the ball was like a white string marvelously stretching out over the players over the green field beyond and then sailing soaring over the rightfield fence  for a moment the stands even the bleachers were stone quiet  no player had ever hit a ball over that fence  it had been deemed impossible as was attested to by the many painted ads offering prizes for such a feat  suddenly the far end of the bleachers exploded and the swelling roar rolled up to engulf the grand stand in thunder  billie ran round the bases to applause never before vented on that field  but he gave no sign that it affected him he did not even doff his cap  whitefaced and stern he hurried to the bench where pat fell all over him and many of the players grasped his hands  up in her box madge was crushing her scorecard and whispering  oh billie i could hug you for that  two runs on two pitched balls  that was an opening to stir an exacting audience to the highest pitch of enthusiasm  the denver manager peremptorily called keene off the diamond and sent in steele a southpaw who had always bothered pats lefthanded hitters  that move showed his astute judgment for steele struck out mcready and retired curtis and mahew on easy chances  it was dalgrens turn to pitch and though he had shown promise in several games he had not yet been tried out on a team of denvers strength the bleachers gave him a good cheering as he walked into the box but for all that they whistled their wonder at pats assurance in putting him against the cowboys in an important game  the lad was visibly nervous and the hardhitting and loudcoaching denver players went after him as if they meant to drive him out of the game  crane stung one to left center for a base moody was out on a liner to short almost doubling up crane the fleetfooted bluett bunted and beat the throw to first langly drove to left for what seemed a threebagger but curtis after a hard run caught the ball almost off the leftfield bleachers  crane and bluett advanced a base on the throwin  then kane batted up a high foulfly burns carroll the kansas city catcher had the reputation of being a fiend for chasing foul flies and he dashed at this one with a speed that threatened a hard fall over the players bench or a collision with the fence  carroll caught the ball and crashed against the grand stand but leaped back with an agility that showed that if there was any harm done it had not been to him  thus the sharp inning ended with a magnificent play  it electrified the spectators into a fierce energy of applause  with one accord by baseball instinct the stands and bleachers and ropedinsidelines realized it was to be a game of games and they answered to the stimulus with a savage enthusiasm that inspired ballplayers to great plays  in the first half of the second inning steeles will to do and his arm to execute were very like his name  kansas city could not score  in their half the denver team made one run by clean hitting  then the closely fought advantage seesawed from one team to the other it was not a pitchers battle though both men worked to the limit of skill and endurance  they were hit hard  dazzling plays kept the score down and the innings short  over the fields hung the portent of something to come every player every spectator felt the subtle baseball chance each inning seemed to lead closer and more thrillingly up to the climax  but at the end of the seventh with the score tied six and six with daring steals hard hits and splendid plays enough to have made memorable several games it seemed that the great portentous moment was still in abeyance  the head of the batting list for kansas city was up  hunt caught the first pitched ball squarely on the end of his bat  it was a mighty drive and as the ball soared and soared over the centerfield hunt raced down the base line and the wingedfooted crane sped outward the bleachers split their throats  the hit looked good for a home run but crane leaped up and caught the ball in his gloved hand  the sudden silence and then the long groan which racked the bleachers was greater tribute to cranes play than any applause  billie sheldon then faced steele  the fans roared hoarsely for billie had hit safely three times out of four  steele used his curve ball but he could not get the batter to go after it  when he had wasted three balls the neverdespairing bleachers howled  now billie in your groove sting the next one  but billie waited  one strike  two strikes  steele cut the plate  that was a test which proved sheldons caliber  with seven innings of exciting play passed with both teams on edge with the bleachers wild and the grand stands keyed up to the breaking point with everything making deliberation almost impossible billie sheldon had remorselessly waited for three balls and two strikes  now   now   now shrieked the bleachers  steele had not tired nor lost his cunning  with hands before him he grimly studied billie then whirling hard to get more weight into his motion he threw the ball  billie swung perfectly and cut a curving liner between the first baseman and the base  like a shot it skipped over the grass out along the foulline into right field  amid tremendous uproar billie stretched the hit into a triple and when he got up out of the dust after his slide into third the noise seemed to be the crashing down of the bleachers  it died out with the choking gurgling yell of the most leatherlunged fan  ooooyoubilliee  mcready marched up and promptly hit a long fly to the redoubtable crane  billie crouched in a sprinters position with his eye on the graceful fielder waiting confidently for the ball to drop as if there had not already been sufficient heartrending moments the chance that governed baseball meted out this play one of the keenest most trying known to the game  players waited spectators waited and the instant of that dropping ball was interminably long  everybody knew crane would catch it everybody thought of the wonderful throwing arm that had made him famous  was it possible for billie sheldon to beat the throw to the plate  crane made the catch and got the ball away at the same instant sheldon leaped from the base and dashed for home  then all eyes were on the ball  it seemed incredible that a ball thrown by human strength could speed plateward so low so straight so swift  but it lost its force and slanted down to bound into the catchers hands just as billie slid over the plate  by the time the bleachers had stopped stamping and bawling curtis ended the inning with a difficult grounder to the infield  once more the kansas city players took the field and burns carroll sang out in his lusty voice keep lively boys  play hard  dig em up an get em  indeed the big catcher was the mainstay of the home team the bulk of the work fell upon his shoulders  dalgren was wild and kept his catcher continually blocking low pitches and wide curves and poorly controlled high fast balls but they were all alike to carroll despite his weight he was as nimble on his feet as a goat and if he once got his hands on the ball he never missed it  it was his encouragement that steadied dalgren his judgment of hitters that carried the young pitcher through dangerous places his lightning swift grasp of points that directed the machinelike work of his team  in this inning carroll exhibited another of his demon chases after a foul fly he threw the basestealing crane out at second and by a remarkable leap and stop of mcreadys throw he blocked a runner who would have tied the score  the cowboys blanked their opponents in the first half of the ninth and trotted in for their turn needing one run to tie two runs to win  there had scarcely been a breathing spell for the onlookers in this rapidfire game  every inning had held them one moment breathless the next wildly clamorous and another waiting in numb fear  what did these last few moments hold in store  the only answer to that was the dogged plugging optimism of the denver players to listen to them to watch them was to gather the impression that baseball fortune always favored them in the end  only three more dal  steady boys its our game rolled out carrolls deep bass  how virile he was  what a tower of strength to the weakening pitcher  but valiantly as dalgren tried to respond he failed  the grindthe strain had been too severe when he finally did locate the plate bluett hit safely  langley bunted along the base line and beat the ball  a blank dead quiet settled down over the bleachers and stands something fearful threatened what might not come to pass even at the last moment of this nerveracking game  there was a runner on first and a runner on second that was bad  exceedingly bad was it that these runners were on base with nobody out  worst of all was the fact that kane was up  kane the best bunter the fastest man to first the hardest hitter in the league  that he would fail to advance those two runners was scarcely worth consideration  once advanced a fly to the outfield a scratch anything almost would tie the score so this was the climax presaged so many times earlier in the game  dalgren seemed to wilt under it  kane swung his ash viciously and called on dalgren to put one over dalgren looked in toward the bench as if he wanted and expected to be taken out  but pat donahue made no sign pat had trained many a pitcher by forcing him to take his medicine  then carroll mask under his arm rolling his big hand in his mitt sauntered down to the pitchers box  the sharp order of the umpire in no wise disconcerted him  he said something to dalgren vehemently nodding his head the while  players and audience alike supposed he was trying to put a little heart into dalgren and liked him the better notwithstanding the opposition to the umpire  carroll sauntered back to his position  he adjusted his breast protector and put on his mask deliberately taking his time  then he stepped behind the plate and after signing for the pitch he slowly moved his right hand up to his mask  dalgren wound up took his swing and let drive even as he delivered the ball carroll bounded away from his position flinging off the mask as he jumped  for a single fleeting instant the catchers position was vacated  but that instant was long enough to make the audience gasp  kane bunted beautifully down the third base line and there carroll stood fifteen feet from the plate agile as a huge monkey  he whipped the ball to mahew at third  mahew wheeled quick as thought and lined the ball to second  sheldon came tearing for the bag caught the ball on the run and with a violent stop and wrench threw it like a bullet to first base  fast as kane was the ball beat him ten feet  a triple play  the players of both teams cheered but the audience slower to grasp the complex and intricate points needed a long moment to realize what had happened  they needed another to divine that carroll had anticipated kanes intention to bunt had left his position as the ball was pitched had planned all risked all played all on kanes sure eye and so he had retired the side and won the game by creating and executing the rarest play in baseball  then the audience rose in a body to greet the great catcher  what a hoarse thundering roar shook the stands and waved in a blast over the field  carroll stood bowing his acknowledgment and then swaggered a little with the sun shining on his handsome heated face  like a conqueror conscious of full blown power he stalked away to the clubhouse  madge ellston came out of her trance and viewed the ragged scorecard her torn parasol her battered gloves and flying hair her generally disheveled state with a little start of dismay but when she got into the thick and press of the moving crowd she found all the women more or less disheveled  and they seemed all the prettier and friendlier for that  it was a happy crowd and voices were conspicuously hoarse  when madge entered the hotel parlor that evening she found her uncle with guests and among them was burns carroll  the presence of the handsome giant affected madge more impellingly than ever before yet in some inexplicably different way  she found herself trembling she sensed a crisis in her feelings for this man and it frightened her she became conscious suddenly that she had always been afraid of him watching carroll receive the congratulations of many of those present she saw that he dominated them as he had her  his magnetism was overpowering his great stature seemed to fill the room his easy careless assurance emanated from superior strength  when he spoke lightly of the game of cranes marvelous catch of dalgrens pitching and of his own triple play it seemed these looming features retreated in perspectivesomehow lost their vital significance because he slighted them  in the light of carrolls illuminating talk in the remembrance of sheldons bitter denunciation in the knowledge of pat donahues estimate of a peculiar type of ballplayer madge ellston found herself judging the manbravely trying to resist his charm to be fair to him and to herself  carroll soon made his way to her side and greeted her with his old familiar manner of possession  however irritating it might be to madge when alone now it held her bound  carroll possessed the elemental attributes of a conqueror  when with him madge whimsically feared that he would snatch her up in his arms and carry her bodily off as the warriors of old did with the women they wanted  but she began to believe that the fascination he exercised upon her was merely physical  that gave her pause not only was burns carroll on trial but also a very foolish fluttering little mothherself  it was time enough however to be stern with herself after she had tried him  wasnt that a splendid catch of cranes today she asked  a lucky stab  crane has a habit of running round like an ostrich and sticking out a hand to catch a ball  its a grandstand play  why a good outfielder would have been waiting under that fly  dalgren did fine work in the box dont you think  oh the kids all right with an old head back of the plate  hes wild though and will never make good in fast company  i won his game today he wouldnt have lasted an inning without me  it was dead wrong for pat to pitch him dalgren simply cant pitch and he hasnt sand enough to learn  a hot retort trembled upon madge ellstons lips but she withheld it and quietly watched carroll  how complacent he was how utterly selfcontained  and billie sheldonwasnt it good to see him brace  what hitting    that home run  sheldon flashed up today  thats the worst of such players  this talk of his slump is all rot when he joined the team he made some lucky hits and the papers lauded him as a comer but he soon got down to his real form  why to break into a game now and then to shut his eyes and hit a couple on the nosethats not baseball pats given him ten days notice and his release will be a good move for the team sheldons not fast enough for this league  im sorry  he seemed so promising replied madge  i liked billypretty well  yes that was evident said carroll firing up  i never could understand what you saw in him  why sheldons no good  he  madge turned a white face that silenced carroll  she excused herself and returned to the parlor where she had last seen her uncle  not finding him there she went into the long corridor and met sheldon dalgren and two more of the players  madge congratulated the young pitcher and the other players on their brilliant work and they not to be outdone gallantly attributed the days victory to her presence at the game  then without knowing in the least how it came about she presently found herself alone with billy and they were strolling into the musicroom  madge did i brace up  the girl risked one quick look at him  how boyish he seemed how eager  what an altogether different billie  but was the difference all in him  somehow despite a conscious shyness in the moment she felt natural and free without the uncertainty and restraint that had always troubled her while with him  oh billie that glorious home run  madge wasnt that hit a dandy  how i made it is a mystery but the bat felt like a feather  i thought of you  tell mewhat did you think when i hit that ball over the fence  billie ill never never tell you  yespleasei want to know  didnt you think somethingnice of me  the pink spots in madges cheeks widened to crimson flames  billie are you stillcrazy about me  now dont come so close cant you behave yourself and dont break my fingers with you terrible baseball hands  well when you made that hit i just collapsed and i said  say it  say it implored billie  she lowered her face and then bravely raised it  i said billie i could hug you for that  billie let me go oh you mustntplease  quite a little while afterward madge remembered to tell billie that she had been seeking her uncle  they met him and pat donahue coming out of the parlor  where have you been all evening demanded mr ellston  shure it looks as if shes signed a new manager said pat his shrewd eyes twinkling  the soft glow in madges cheeks deepened into telltale scarlet billie resembled a schoolboy stricken in guilt  aha so thats it queried her uncle  ellston said pat  billies homerun drive today recalled his notice an if i dont miss guess it won him another gamethe best game in life  by george exclaimed mr ellston  i was afraid it was carroll  he led madge away and pat followed with billie  shure it was good to see you brace billie said the manager with a kindly hand on the young mans arm  im tickled to death  that ten days notice doesnt go  see  ive had to shake up the team but your job is good  i released mcready outright an traded carroll to denver for a catcher and a fielder  some of the directors hollered murder an i expect the fans will roar but im running this team ill have harmony among my players  carroll is a great catcher but hes a knocker    the winning ball  one day in july our rochester club leader in the eastern league had returned to the hotel after winning a doubleheader from the syracuse club  for some occult reason there was to be a layoff next day and then on the following another doubleheader  these doubleheaders we hated next to exhibition games  still a layoff for twentyfour hours at that stage of the race was a godsend and we received the news with exclamations of pleasure  after dinner we were all sitting and smoking comfortably in front of the hotel when our manager merritt came hurriedly out of the lobby it struck me that he appeared a little flustered  say you fellars he said brusquely  pack your suits and be ready for the bus at seventhirty  for a moment there was a blank ominous silence while we assimilated the meaning of his terse speech  ive got a good thing on for tomorrow continued the manager  sixty per cent gate receipts if we win  that guelph team is hot stuff though  guelph exclaimed some of the players suspiciously  wheres guelph  its in canada  well take the night express an get there tomorrow in time for the game an well hev to hustle  upon merritt then rained a multiplicity of excuses  gillinger was not well and ought to have that days rest  sneads eyes would profit by a layoff  deerfoot browning was leading the league in base running and as his legs were all bruised and scraped by sliding a manager who was not an idiot would have a care of such valuable runmakers for his team  lake had charleyhorse  hathaways arm was sore  banes stomach threatened gastritis  spike dorans finger needed a chance to heal  i was stale and the other players three pitchers swore their arms should be in the hospital  cut it out said merritt getting exasperated youd all lay down on menow wouldnt you  well listen to this  mcdougal pitched today he doesnt go  blake works friday he doesnt go  but the rest of you puffedup highsalaried stiffs pack your grips quick  see  itll cost any fresh fellar fifty for missin the train  so that was how eleven of the rochester team found themselves moodily boarding a pullman en route for buffalo and canada  we went to bed early and arose late  guelph lay somewhere in the interior of canada and we did not expect to get there until 1 oclock  as it turned out the train was late we had to dress hurriedly in the smoking room pack our citizen clothes in our grips and leave the train to go direct to the ball grounds without time for lunch  it was a tired dustyeyed peevish crowd of ball players that climbed into a waiting bus at the little station  we had never heard of guelph we did not care anything about rube baseball teams  baseball was not play to us it was the hardest kind of work and of all things an exhibition game was an abomination  the guelph players strapping lads met us with every mark of respect and courtesy and escorted us to the field with a brass band that was loud in welcome if not harmonious in tune  some 500 men and boys trotted curiously along with us for all the world as if the bus were a circus parade cage filled with striped tigers what a rustic motley crowd massed about in and on that ball ground  there must have been 10000  the audience was strange to us  the indians halfbreeds frenchcanadians the huge hulking bearded farmers or traders or trappers whatever they were were new to our baseball experience  the players themselves however earned the largest share of our attention  by the time they had practiced a few moments we looked at merritt and merritt looked at us  these long powerful bighanded lads evidently did not know the difference between lacrosse and baseball but they were quick as cats on their feet and they scooped up the ball in a way wonderful to see and throwit made a professionals heart swell just to see them line the ball across the diamond  lord what whips these lads have exclaimed merritt  hope were not up against it if this team should beat us we wouldnt draw a handful at toronto  we cant afford to be beaten jump around and cinch the game quick  if we get in a bad place ill sneak in the rabbit  the rabbit was a baseball similar in appearance to the ordinary league ball under its horsehide cover however it was remarkably different  an ingenious fan a friend of merritt had removed the covers from a number of league balls and sewed them on rubber balls of his own making they could not be distinguished from the regular article not even by an experienced professionaluntil they were hit  then  the fact that after every bounce one of these rubber balls bounded swifter and higher had given it the name of the rabbit  many a game had the rabbit won for us at critical stages  of course it was against the rules of the league and of course every player in the league knew about it still when it was judiciously and cleverly brought into a close game the rabbit would be in play and very probably over the fence before the opposing captain could learn of it let alone appeal to the umpire  fellars look at that guy whos goin to pitch suddenly spoke up one of the team  many as were the country players whom we seasoned and traveled professionals had run across this twirler outclassed them for remarkable appearance  moreover what put an entirely different tinge to our momentary humor was the discovery that he was as wild as a march hare and could throw a ball so fast that it resembled a pea shot from a boys air gun  deerfoot led our batting list and after the first pitched ball which he did not see and the second which ticked his shirt as it shot past he turned to us with an expression that made us groan inwardly  when deerfoot looked that way it meant the pitcher was dangerous deerfoot made no effort to swing at the next ball and was promptly called out on strikes  i was second at bat and went up with some reluctance  i happened to be leading the league in both long distance and safe hitting and i doted on speed  but having stopped many mean inshoots with various parts of my anatomy i was rather squeamish about facing backwoods yaps who had no control  when i had watched a couple of his pitches which the umpire called strikes i gave him credit for as much speed as rusie  these balls were as straight as a string singularly without curve jump or variation of any kind  i lined the next one so hard at the shortstop that it cracked like a pistol as it struck his hands and whirled him half off his feet  still he hung to the ball and gave opportunity for the first crash of applause  boys hes a trifle wild i said to my teammates but he has the most beautiful ball to hit you ever saw  i dont believe he uses a curve and when we once time that speed well kill it  next inning after old man hathaway had baffled the canadians with his wide tantalizing curves my predictions began to be verified  snead rapped one high and far to deep right field  to our infinite surprise however the right fielder ran with fleetness that made our own deerfoot seem slow and he got under the ball and caught it  doran sent a sizzling grasscutter down toward left  the lanky third baseman darted over dived down and coming up with the ball exhibited the power of a throwing arm that made as all green with envy  then when the catcher chased a foul fly somewhere back in the crowd and caught it we began to take notice  lucky stabs said merritt cheerfully  they cant keep that up well drive him to the woods next time  but they did keep it up moreover they became more brilliant as the game progressed  what with hathaways heady pitching we soon disposed of them when at the bat our turns however owing to the wonderful fielding of these backwoodsmen were also fruitless  merritt with his mind ever on the slice of gate money coming if we won began to fidget and fume and find fault  youre a swell lot of champions now aint you he observed between innings  all baseball players like to bat and nothing pleases them so much as base hits on the other hand nothing is quite so painful as to send out hard liners only to see them caught  and it seemed as if every man on our team connected with that lanky twirlers fast high ball and hit with the force that made the bat spring only to have one of these rubes get his big hands upon it  considering that we were in no angelic frame of mind before the game started and in view of merritts persistently increasing ill humor this failure of ours to hit a ball safely gradually worked us into a kind of frenzy  from indifference we passed to determination and from that to sheer passionate purpose  luck appeared to be turning in the sixth inning with one out lake hit a beauty to right  doran beat an infield grounder and reached first hathaway struck out  with browning up and me next the situation looked rather precarious for the canadians  say deerfoot whispered merritt dump one down the thirdbase line hes playin deep its a pipe  then the bases will be full an reddyll clean up  in a stage like that browning was a man absolutely to depend upon  he placed a slow bunt in the grass toward third and sprinted for first the third baseman fielded the ball but being confused did not know where to throw it  stick it in your basket yelled merritt in a delight that showed how hard he was pulling for the gate money and his beaming smile as he turned to me was inspiring  now reddy its up to you  im not worrying about whats happened so far  i know with you at bat in a pinch its all off  merritts compliment was pleasing but it did not augment my purpose for that already had reached the highest mark  love of hitting if no other thing gave me the thrilling fire to arise to the opportunity selecting my light bat i went up and faced the rustic twirler and softly said things to him  he delivered the ball and i could have yelled aloud so fast so straight so true it sped toward me  then i hit it harder than i had ever hit a ball in my life  the bat sprung as if it were whalebone and the ball took a bullet course between center and left  so beautiful a hit was it that i watched as i ran  out of the tail of my eye i saw the center fielder running  when i rounded first base i got a good look at this fielder and though i had seen the greatest outfielders the game ever produced i never saw one that covered ground so swiftly as he  on the ball soared and began to drop on the fielder sped and began to disappear over a little hill back of his position  then he reached up with a long arm and marvelously caught the ball in one hand  he went out of sight as i touched second base and the heterogeneous crowd knew about a great play to make more noise than a herd of charging buffalo  in the next half inning our opponents by clean drives scored two runs and we in our turn again went out ignominiously  when the first of the eighth came we were desperate and clamored for the rabbit  ive sneaked it in said merritt with a low voice  got it to the umpire on the last passed ball  see the pitchers got it now  boys its all off but the fireworks  now break loose  a peculiarity about the rabbit was the fact that though it felt as light as the regulation league ball it could not be thrown with the same speed and to curve it was an impossibility  bane hit the first delivery from our hoosier stumbling block  the ball struck the ground and began to bound toward short  with every bound it went swifter longer and higher and it bounced clear over the shortstops head  lake chopped one in front of the plate and it rebounded from the ground straight up so high that both runners were safe before it came down  doran hit to the pitcher  the ball caromed his leg scooted fiendishly at the second baseman and tried to run up all over him like a tame squirrel  bases full  hathaway got a safe fly over the infield and two runs tallied  the pitcher in spite of the help of the umpire could not locate the plate for balknap and gave him a base on balls  bases full again  deerfoot slammed a hot liner straight at the second baseman which striking squarely in his hands recoiled as sharply as if it had struck a wall  doran scored and still the bases were filled  the laboring pitcher began to get rattled he could not find his usual speed he knew it but evidently could not account for it  when i came to bat indications were not wanting that the canadian team would soon be up in the air  the long pitcher delivered the rabbit and got it low down by my knees which was an unfortunate thing for him  i swung on that one and trotted round the bases behind the runners while the center and left fielders chased the ball  gillinger weighed nearly two hundred pounds and he got all his weight under the rabbit  it went so high that we could scarcely see it all the infielders rushed in and after staggering around with heads bent back one of them the shortstop managed to get under it  the rabbit bounded forty feet out of his hands  when sneads grounder nearly tore the third basemans leg off when banes hit proved as elusive as a flitting shadow when lakes liner knocked the pitcher flat and dorans fly leaped high out of the center fielders glovethen those earnest simple country ballplayers realized something was wrong  but they imagined it was in themselves and after a short spell of rattles they steadied up and tried harder than ever  the motions they went through trying to stop that jumping jackrabbit of a ball were ludicrous in the extreme  finally through a foul a short fly and a scratch hit to first they retired the side and we went into the field with the score 14 to 2 in our favor  but merritt had not found it possible to get the rabbit out of play  we spent a fatefully anxious few moments squabbling with the umpire and captain over the rabbit  at the idea of letting those herculean railsplitters have a chance to hit the rubber ball we felt our blood run cold  but this ball has a rip in it blustered gillinger  he lied atrociously  a microscope could not have discovered as much as a scratch in that smooth leather  sure it has supplemented merritt in the suave tones of a stage villain  were used to playing with good balls  why did you ring this one in on us asked the captain  we never threw out this ball  we want a chance to hit it  that was just the one thing we did not want them to have  but fate played against us  get up on your toes now an dust said merritt  take your medicine you lazy sitinfrontofthehotel stiffs  think of pay day  not improbably we all entertained the identical thought that old man hathaway was the last pitcher under the sun calculated to be effective with the rabbit  he never relied on speed in fact merritt often scornfully accused him of being unable to break a pane of glass he used principally what we called floaters and a change of pace  both styles were absolutely impractical with the rabbit  its comin to us all right all right yelled deerfoot to me across the intervening grass  i was of the opinion that it did not take any genius to make deerfoots ominous prophecy  old man hathaway gazed at merritt on the bench as if he wished the manager could hear what he was calling him and then at his fellowplayers as if both to warn and beseech them then he pitched the rabbit  crack  the big lumbering canadian rapped the ball at crab bane  i did not see it because it went so fast but i gathered from crabs actions that it must have been hit in his direction  at any rate one of his legs flopped out sidewise as if it had been suddenly jerked and he fell in a heap the ball a veritable rabbit in its wild jumps headed on for deerfoot who contrived to stop it with his knees  the next batter resembled the first one and the hit likewise only it leaped wickedly at doran and went through his hands as if they had been paper  the third man batted up a very high fly to gillinger  he clutched at it with his huge shovel hands but he could not hold it the way he pounced upon the ball dug it out of the grass and hurled it at hathaway showed his anger  obviously hathaway had to stop the throw for he could not get out of the road and he spoke to his captain in what i knew were no complimentary terms  thus began retribution  those husky lads continued to hammer the rabbit at the infielders and as it bounced harder at every bounce so they batted harder at every bat  another singular feature about the rabbit was the seeming impossibility for professionals to hold it  their familiarity with it their understanding of its vagaries and inconsistencies their mortal dread made fielding it a much more difficult thing than for their opponents  by way of variety the lambasting canadians commenced to lambast a few over the hills and far away which chased deerfoot and me until our tongues lolled out  every time a run crossed the plate the motley crowd howled roared danced and threw up their hats  the members of the batting team pranced up and down the side lines giving a splendid imitation of cannibals celebrating the occasion of a feast  once snead stooped down to trap the rabbit and it slipped through his legs for which his comrades jeered him unmercifully  then a brawny batter sent up a tremendously high fly between short and third  you take it yelled gillinger to bane  you take it replied the crab and actually walked backward  that ball went a mile high the sky was hazy gray the most perplexing in which to judge a fly ball  an ordinary fly gave trouble enough in the gauging  gillinger wandered around under the ball for what seemed an age  it dropped as swiftly as a rocket shoots upward  gillinger went forward in a circle then sidestepped and threw up his broad hands  he misjudged the ball and it hit him fairly on the head and bounced almost to where doran stood at second  our big captain wilted  time was called  but gillinger when he came to refused to leave the game and went back to third with a lump on his head as large as a goose egg  every one of his teammates was sorry yet every one howled in glee  to be hit on the head was the unpardonable sin for a professional  old man hathaway gradually lost what little speed he had and with it his nerve  every time he pitched the rabbit he dodged  that was about the funniest and strangest thing ever seen on a ball field  yet it had an element of tragedy  hathaways expert contortions saved his head and body on divers occasions but presently a low bounder glanced off the grass and manifested an affinity for his leg  we all knew from the crack and the way the pitcher went down that the rabbit had put him out of the game  the umpire called time and merritt came running on the diamond  hard luck old man said the manager thatll make a green and yellow spot all right boys were still two runs to the good  theres one out an we can win yet  deerfoot youre as badly crippled as hathaway  the bench for yours  hooker will go to center an ill pitch  merritts idea did not strike us as a bad one he could pitch and he always kept his arm in prime condition  we welcomed him into the fray for two reasonsbecause he might win the game and because he might be overtaken by the baseball nemesis  while merritt was putting on hathaways baseball shoes some of us endeavored to get the rabbit away from the umpire but he was too wise  merritt received the innocentlooking ball with a look of mingled disgust and fear and he summarily ordered us to our positions  not far had we gone however when we were electrified by the umpires sharp words  naw  naw you dont  i saw you change the ball i gave you fer one in your pocket  naw you dont come enny of your american dodges on us gimmee thet ball an you use the other or ill stop the game  wherewith the shrewd umpire took the ball from merritts hand and fished the rabbit from his pocket  our thwarted manager stuttered his wrath  yyou bebewhwhiskered yyap  ill gggive  what dire threat he had in mind never materialized for he became speechless  he glowered upon the cool little umpire and then turned grandly toward the plate  it may have been imagination yet i made sure merritt seemed to shrink and grow smaller before he pitched a ball  for one thing the plate was uphill from the pitchers box and then the fellow standing there loomed up like a hill and swung a bat that would have served as a wagon tongue no wonder merritt evinced nervousness  presently he whirled and delivered the ball  bing  a dark streak and a white puff of dust over second base showed how safe that hit was  by dint of manful body work hooker contrived to stop the rabbit in midcenter  another run scored  human nature was proof against this temptation and merritts players tendered him manifold congratulations and dissertations  grand you old skinflint grand  there was a twodollar bill stickin on thet hit  why didnt you stop it  say merritt what little brains youve got will presently be ridin on the rabbit  you will chase up these exhibition games  take your medicine now  ha  ha  ha  after these merciless taunts and particularly after the next slashing hit that tied the score merritt looked appreciably smaller and humbler  he threw up another ball and actually shied as it neared the plate  the giant who was waiting to slug it evidently thought better of his eagerness as far as that pitch was concerned for he let it go by  merritt got the next ball higher  with a mighty swing the batsman hit a terrific liner right at the pitcher  quick as lightning merritt wheeled and the ball struck him with the sound of two boards brought heavily together with a smack  merritt did not fall he melted to the ground and writhed while the runners scored with more tallies than they needed to win  what did we care  justice had been done us and we were unutterably happy  crabe bane stood on his head gillinger began a war dance old man hathaway hobbled out to the side lines and whooped like an indian snead rolled over and over in the grass  all of us broke out into typical expressions of baseball frenzy and individual ones illustrating our particular moods  merritt got up and made a dive for the ball with face positively flaming he flung it far beyond the merry crowd over into a swamp then he limped for the bench  which throw ended the most memorable game ever recorded to the credit of the rabbit    false colors  fate has decreed more bad luck for salisbury in saturdays game with bellville  it has leaked out that our rivals will come over strengthened by a ringer no less than yales star pitcher wayne we saw him shut princeton out in june in the last game of the college year and we are not optimistic in our predictions as to what salisbury can do with him  this appears a rather unfair procedure for bellville to resort to  why couldnt they come over with their regular team they have won a game and so have we both games were close and brilliant the deciding game has roused unusual interest  we are inclined to resent bellvilles methods as unsportsmanlike all our players can do is to go into this game on saturday and try the harder to win  wayne laid down the salisbury gazette with a little laugh of amusement yet feeling a vague disquieting sense of something akin to regret  pretty decent of that chap not to roast me he soliloquized  somewhere he had heard that salisbury maintained an unsalaried team it was notorious among college athletes that the bellville club paid for the services of distinguished players  and this in itself rather inclined wayne to sympathize with salisbury  he knew something of the struggles of a strictly amateur club to cope with its semiprofessional rivals  as he was sitting there idly tipped back in a comfortable chair dreaming over some of the baseball disasters he had survived before his college career he saw a young man enter the lobby of the hotel speak to the clerk and then turn and come directly toward the window where wayne was sitting  are yon mr wayne the yale pitcher he asked eagerly  he was a fairhaired cleancut young fellow and his voice rang pleasantly  guilty replied wayne  my names huling  im captain of the salisbury nine  just learned you were in town and are going to pitch against us tomorrow  wont you walk out into the grounds with me now you might want to warm up a little  thank you yes i will  guess i wont need my suit  ill just limber up and give my arm a good rub  it struck wayne before they had walked far that huling was an amiable and likable chap  as the captain of the salisbury nine he certainly had no reason to be agreeable to the morristown ringer even though wayne did happen to be a famous yale pitcher  the field was an oval green as an emerald level as a billiard table and had no fences or stands to obstruct the open view of the surrounding wooded country  on each side of the diamond were rows of wooden benches and at one end of the field stood a little clubhouse  wayne took off his coat and tossed a ball for a while to an ambitious youngster and then went into the clubhouse where huling introduced him to several of his players  after a good rubdown wayne thanked huling for his courtesy and started out intending to go back to town  why not stay to see us practice asked the captain  were not afraid youll size up our weaknesses  as a matter of fact we dont look forward to any hitting stunts tomorrow eh burns  burns here is our leading hitter and hes been unusually noncommittal since he heard who was going to pitch for bellville  well i wouldnt give a whole lot for my prospects of a home run tomorrow said burns with a laugh  wayne went outside and found a seat in the shade  a number of urchins had trooped upon the green field and carriages and motors were already in evidence  by the time the players came out of the dressing room ready for practice there was quite a little crowd in attendance  despite waynes hesitation huling insisted upon introducing him to friends and finally hauled him up to a big touring car full of girls wayne being a yale pitcher had seen several thousand pretty girls but the group in that automobile fairly dazzled him  and the last one to whom huling presented himwith the words  dorothy this is mr wayne the yale pitcher who is to play with bellville tomorrow mr wayne my sisterwas the girl he had known he would meet some day  climb up mr wayne  we can make room invited miss huling  wayne thought the awkwardness with which he found a seat beside her was unbecoming to a yale senior  but considering she was the girl he had been expecting to discover for years his clumsiness bespoke the importance of the event  the merry laughter of the girls rang in his ears presently a voice detached itself from the others and came floating softly to him  mr wayne so youre going to wrest our laurels from us asked miss huling  i dont knowim not infallibleive been beaten  when  not this season she inquired quickly betraying a knowledge of his record that surprised and pleased him  mr wayne i was at the polo grounds on june fifteenth  her white hand lightly touched the princeton pin at her neck  wayne roused suddenly out of his trance  the girl was a princeton girl  the gleam of her golden hair the flash of her blue eyes became clear in sight  im very pleased to hear it he replied  it was a great game mr wayne and you may well be proud of your part in winning it  i shouldnt be surprised if you treated the salisbury team to the same coat of whitewash  we girls are up in arms  our boys stood a fair chance to win this game but now theres a doubt  by the way are you acquainted in bellville  no  i met reed the bellville captain in new york this week  he had already gotten an extra pitcheranother ringerfor this game but he said he preferred me if it could be arranged  while conversing wayne made note of the fact that the other girls studiously left him to miss huling  if the avoidance had not been so marked he would never have thought of it  mr wayne if your word is not involvedwill you change your mind and pitch tomorrows game for us instead of bellville  quite amazed wayne turned squarely to look at miss huling  instead of disarming his quick suspicion her cool sweet voice and brave blue eyes confirmed it  the charms of the captains sister were to be used to win him away from the bellville nine  he knew the trick it had been played upon him before  but never had any other such occasion given him a feeling of regret this case was different she was the girl  and she meant to flirt with him to use her eyes for all they were worth to encompass the waterloo of the rival team  no he had made a mistake after allshe was not the real girl suddenly conscious of a little shock of pain he dismissed that dream girl from his mind and determined to meet miss huling half way in her game  he could not flirt as well as he could pitch still he was no novice  well miss huling my word certainly is not involved  but as to pitching for salisburythat depends  upon what  upon what there is in it  mr wayne you meanmoney  oh i know my brother rex told me how you college men are paid big sums  our association will not give a dollar and besides my brother knows nothing of this  but we girls are heart and soul on winning this game  well  miss huling i didnt mean remuneration in sordid cash interrupted wayne in a tone that heightened the color in her cheeks  wayne eyed her keenly with mingled emotions was that roseleaf flush in her cheeks natural some girls could blush at will  were the wistful eyes the earnest lips only shamming  it cost him some bitterness to decide that they were her beauty fascinated while it hardened him eternally the beauty of women meant the undoing of men whether they played the simple inconsequential game of baseball or the great absorbing mutable game of life  the shame of the situation for him was increasingly annoying inasmuch as this lovely girl should stoop to flirtation with a stranger and the same time draw him allure him despite the apparent insincerity  miss huling ill pitch your game for two things he continued  name them  wear yale blue in place of that orangeandblack princeton pin  i will  she said it with a shyness a look in her eyes that made wayne wince  what a perfect little actress  but there seemed just a chance that this was not deceit  for an instant he wavered held back by subtle finer intuition then he beat down the mounting influence of truth in those darkblue eyes and spoke deliberately  the other thing isif i win the gamea kiss  dorothy hulings face flamed scarlet  but this did not affect wayne so deeply though it showed him his mistake as the darkening shadow of disappointment in her eyes  if she had been a flirt she would have been prepared for rudeness  he began casting about in his mind for some apology some mitigation of his offense but as he was about to speak the sudden fading of her color leaving her pale and the look in her proud dark eyes disconcerted him out of utterance  certainly mr wayne  i agree to your price if you win the game  but how immeasurable was the distance between the shy consent to wear yale blue and the pale surprised agreement to his second proposal wayne experienced a strange sensation of personal loss  while he endeavored to find his tongue miss huling spoke to one of the boys standing near and he started off on a run for the field presently huling and the other players broke for the car soon surrounding it in breathless anticipation  wayne is it straight  youll pitch for us tomorrow demanded the captain with shining eyes  surely i will  bellville dont need me theyve got mackay of georgetown replied wayne  accustomed as he was to being mobbed by enthusiastic students and admiring friends wayne could not but feel extreme embarrassment at the reception accorded him now  he felt that he was sailing under false colors  the boys mauled him the girls fluttered about him with glad laughter he had to tear himself away and when he finally reached his hotel he went to his room with his mind in a tumult  wayne cursed himself roundly then he fell into deep thought  he began to hope he could retrieve the blunder  he would win the game he would explain to her the truth he would ask for an opportunity to prove he was worthy of her friendship he would not mention the kiss  this last thought called up the soft curve of her red lips and that it was possible for him to kiss her made the temptation strong  his sleep that night was not peaceful and dreamless  he awakened late had breakfast sent to his room and then took a long walk out into the country  after lunch he dodged the crowd in the hotel lobby and hurried upstairs where he put on his baseball suit  the first person he met upon going down was reed the bellville man  whats this i hear wayne about your pitching for salisbury today  i got your telegram  straight goods replied wayne  but i thought you intended to pitch for us  i didnt promise did i  no  still it looks fishy to me  youve got mackay havent you  yes  the truth is i intended to use you both  well ill try to win for salisbury  hope theres no hard feeling  not at all  only if i didnt have the georgetown crack id yell murder  as it is well trim salisbury anyway  maybe answered wayne laughing  its a hot day and my arm feels good  when wayne reached the ball grounds he thought he had never seen a more inspiring sight the bright green oval was surrounded by a glittering mass of white and blue and black  out along the foul lines were carriages motors and tallyhos brilliant with waving fans and flags over the field murmured the low hum of many voices  here you are cried huling making a grab for wayne  where were you this morning we couldnt find you  come  weve got a minute before the practice whistle blows and i promised to exhibit you  he hustled wayne down the firstbase line past the cheering crowd out among the motors to the same touring car that he remembered  a bevy of whitegowned girls rose like a covey of ptarmigans and whirled flags of maroon and gray  dorothy huling wore a bow of yale blue upon her breast and wayne saw it and her face through a blur  hurry girls get it over  weve got to practice said the captain  in the merry melee some one tied a knot of ribbon upon wayne  who it was he did not know he saw only the averted face of dorothy huling and as he returned to the field with a dull pang he determined he would make her indifference disappear with the gladness of a victory for her team  the practice was short but long enough for wayne to locate the glaring weakness of salisbury at shortstop and third base  in fact most of the players of his team showed rather poor form they were overstrained and plainly lacked experience necessary for steadiness in an important game  burns the catcher however gave wayne confidence  he was a short sturdy youngster with all the earmarks of a coming star  huling the captain handled himself well at first base  the bellville players were more matured and some of them were former college cracks  wayne saw that he had his work cut out for him  the whistle blew  the bellville team trotted to their position in the field the umpire called play and tossed a ball to mackay the long lean georgetown pitcher  wells the first batter fouled out stamford hit an easy bounce to the pitcher and clews put up a little texas leaguerall going out one two three on three pitched balls  the teams changed from bat to field  wayne faced the plate amid vociferous cheering  he felt that he could beat this team even without good support  he was in the finest condition and his arm had been resting for ten days  he knew that if he had control of his high inshoot these bellville players would feel the whiz of some speed under their chins  he struck moore out retired reed on a measly fly and made clark hit a weak grounder to second and he walked in to the bench assured of the outcome  on some days he had poor control on others his drop ball refused to work properly but as luck would have it he had never had greater speed or accuracy or a more bewildering fast curve than on this day when he meant to win a game for a girl  boys ive got everything he said to his fellowplayers calling them around him  a couple of runs will win for us  now listen i know mackay  he hasnt any speed or much of a curve all hes got is a teasing slow ball and a foxy head dont be too anxious to hit  make him put em over  but the salisbury players were not proof against the tempting slow balls that mackay delivered  they hit at wide curves far off the plate and when they did connect with the ball it was only to send an easy chance to the infielders  the game seesawed along inning after inning it was a pitchers battle that looked as if the first run scored would win the game  mackay toyed with the salisbury boys it was his pleasure to toss up twisting floating balls that could scarcely be hit out of the diamond  wayne had the bellville players utterly at his mercy he mixed up his high jump and fast drop so cleverly with his sweeping outcurve that his opponents were unable to gauge his delivery at all  in the first of the seventh barr for bellville hit a ball which the third baseman should have fielded  but he fumbled  the second batter sent a fly to shortstop who muffed it  the third hitter reached his base on another error by an infielder  here the bases were crowded and the situation had become critical all in a moment wayne believed the infield would go to pieces and lose the game then and there if another hit went to short or third  steady up boys called wayne and beckoned for his catcher  burns its up to you and me he said in a low tone  ive got to fan the rest of these hitters  youre doing splendidly  now watch close for my drop  be ready to go down on your knees when i let myself out the ball generally hits the ground just back of the plate  speed em over said burns his sweaty face grim and determined ill get in front of em  the head of the batting list was up for bellville and the whole bellville contingent on the side lines rose and yelled and cheered  moore was a left handed hitter who choked his bat up short and poked at the ball  he was a good bunter and swift on his feet  wayne had taken his measure as he had that of the other players earlier in the game and he knew it was good pitching to keep the ball in close to moores hands so that if he did hit it the chances were it would not go safe  summoning all his strength wayne took his long swing and shot the ball over the inside corner with terrific speed  one strike  wayne knew it would not do to waste any balls if he wished to maintain that speed so he put the second one in the same place  moore struck too late  two strikes  then burns signed for the last drop  wayne delivered it with trepidation for it was a hard curve to handle  moore fell all over himself trying to hit it  little burns dropped to his knees to block the vicious curve  it struck the ground and glancing boomed deep on the breast protector  how the salisbury supporters roared their approval  one man outthe bases fullwith reed the slugging captain at bat  if reed had a weakness wayne had not discovered it yet although reed had not hit safely the captain stood somewhat back from the plate a fact that induced wayne to try him with the speedy outcurve  reed lunged with a powerful swing pulling away from the plate and he missed the curve by a foot  wayne did not need to know any more  reed had made his reputation slugging straight balls from heedless pitchers  he chopped the air twice more and flung his bat savagely to the ground  two outplay the hitter called wayne to his team  clark the third man up was the surest batter on the bellville team he looked dangerous  he had made the only hit so far to the credit of his team  wayne tried to work him on a high fast ball close in clark swung freely and cracked a ripping liner to left  half the crowd roared and then groaned for the beautiful hit went foul by several yards  wayne wisely decided to risk all on his fast drop  clark missed the first fouled the second  two strikes  then he waited  he cooly let one two three of the fast drops go by without attempting to hit them  burns valiantly got his body in front of them  these balls were all over the plate but too low to be called strikes  with two strikes and three balls and the bases full clark had the advantage  tight as the place was wayne did not flinch the game depended practically upon the next ball delivered  wayne craftily and daringly decided to use another fast drop for of all his assortment that would be the one least expected by clark but it must be started higher so that in case clark made no effort to swing it would still be a strike  gripping the ball with a clinched hand wayne swung sharply and drove it home with the limit of his power  it sped like a bullet waist high and just before reaching the plate darted downward as if it had glanced on an invisible barrier  clark was fooled completely and struck futilely but the ball caromed from the hard ground hit burns with a resounding thud and bounced away clark broke for first and moore dashed for home like a tiger the little catcher pounced upon the ball and leaping back into line blocked the sliding moore three feet from the plate  pandemonium burst loose among the salisbury adherents  the men bawled the women screamed the boys shrieked and all waved their hats and flags and jumped up and down and manifested symptoms of baseball insanity  in the first of the eighth inning mackay sailed up the balls like balloons and disposed of three batters on the same old weak hits to his clever fielders  in the last of the eighth wayne struck out three more bellville players  burns youre up said wayne who in his earnestness to win kept cheering his comrades do something  get your base any way you can get in front of one  we must score this inning  faithful battered burns cunningly imposed his hip over the plate and received another bruise in the interests of his team  the opposing players furiously stormed at the umpire for giving him his base but burns trick went through  burnett bunted skilfully sending burns to second  cole hit a fly to center  then huling singled between short and third  it became necessary for the umpire to delay the game while he put the madly leaping boys back off the coaching lines  the shrill hilarious cheering gradually died out and the field settled into a forced quiet  wayne hurried up to the plate and took his position  he had always been a timely hitter and he gritted his teeth in his resolve to settle this game  mackay whirled his long arm wheeled took his long stride and pitched a slow tantalizing ball that seemed never to get anywhere but wayne waited timed it perfectly and met it squarely  the ball flew safely over short and but for a fine sprint and stop by the left fielder would have resulted in a triple possibly a home run as it was burns and huling scored and wayne by a slide reached second base  when he arose and saw the disorderly riot and heard the noise of that welldressed audience he had a moment of exultation then wells flew out to center ending the chances for more runs  as wayne received the ball in the pitchers box he paused and looked out across the field toward a whitecrowned motor car and he caught a gleam of dorothy hulings golden hair and wondered if she were glad  for nothing short of the miraculous could snatch this game from him now  burns had withstood a severe pounding but he would last out the inning and wayne did not take into account the rest of the team  he opened up with no slackening of his terrific speed and he struck out the three remaining batters on eleven pitched balls then in the rising din he ran for burns and gave him a mighty hug  you made the gamest stand of any catcher i ever pitched to he said warmly  burns looked at his quivering puffed and bleeding hands and smiled as if to say that this was praise to remember and reward enough then the crowd swooped down on them and they were swallowed up in the clamor and surge of victory  when wayne got out of the thick and press of it he made a bee line for his hotel and by running a gauntlet managed to escape  resting dressing and dining were matters which he went through mechanically with his mind ever on one thing  later he found a dark corner of the porch and sat there waiting thinking there was to be a dance given in honor of the team that evening at the hotel  he watched the boys and girls pass up the steps  when the music commenced he arose and went into the hall it was bright with white gowns and gay with movement  there he is  grab him somebody yelled huling  do something for me quick implored wayne of the captain as he saw the young people wave toward him  salisbury is yours tonight replied huling  ask your sister to save me one dance  then he gave himself up  he took his meed of praise and flattery and he withstood the battery of arch eyes modestly as became the winner of many fields  but even the reception after the princeton game paled in comparison with this impromptu dance  she was here  always it seemed while he listened or talked or danced his eyes were drawn to a slender graceful form and a fair face crowned with golden hair  then he was making his way to where she stood near one of the open windows  he never knew what he said to her nor what reply she made but she put her arm in his and presently they were gliding over the polished floor  to wayne the dance was a dream  he led her through the hall and out upon the balcony where composure strangely came to him  mr wayne i have to thank you for saving the day for us  you pitched magnificently  i would have broken my arm to win that game burst out wayne  miss huling i made a blunder yesterday  i thought there was a conspiracy to persuade me to throw down bellville ive known of such things and i resented it you understand what i thought  i humbly offer my apologies and beg that you forget the rude obligation i forced upon you  how cold she was  how unattainable in that moment  he caught his breath and rushed on  your brother and the management of the club have asked me to pitch for salisbury the remainder of the season  i shall be happy toif  if what  she was all alive now flushing warmly dark eyes alight the girl of his dreams  if you will forgive meif you will let me be your friendifmiss huling you will again wear that bit of yale blue  if mr wayne you had very sharp eyes you would have noticed that i still wear it    the manager of maddens hill  willie howarth loved baseball  he loved it all the more because he was a cripple  the game was more beautiful and wonderful to him because he would never be able to play it  for willie had been born with one leg shorter than the other he could not run and at 11 years of age it was all he could do to walk with a crutch  nevertheless willie knew more about baseball than any other boy on maddens hill  an uncle of his had once been a ballplayer and he had taught willie the fine points of the game  and this uncles ballplayer friends who occasionally visited him had imparted to willie the vernacular of the game  so that willies knowledge of players and play and particularly of the strange talk the wild and whirling words on the lips of the real baseball men made him the envy of every boy on maddens hill and a mine of information  willie never missed attending the games played on the lots and he could tell why they were won or lost  willie suffered considerable pain mostly at night and this had given him a habit of lying awake in the dark hours grieving over that crooked leg that forever shut him out of the heritage of youth  he had kept his secret well he was accounted shy because he was quiet and had never been able to mingle with the boys in their activity no one except his mother dreamed of the fire and hunger and pain within his breast  his schoolmates called him daddy  it was a name given for his bent shoulders his labored gait and his thoughtful face too old for his years  and no one not even his mother guessed how that name hurt willie  it was a source of growing unhappiness with willie that the maddens hill boys were always beaten by the other teams of the town  he really came to lose his sadness over his own misfortune in pondering on the wretched play of the maddens hill baseball club  he had all a boys pride in the locality where he lived  and when the boggs farm team administered a crushing defeat to maddens hill willie grew desperate  monday he met lane griffith the captain of the maddens hill nine  hello daddy said lane  he was a big aggressive boy and in a way had a fondness for willie  lane you got an orful trimmin up on the boggs  what d you wanter let them country jakes beat you for  aw daddy they was lucky  umpire had hayseed in his eyes  robbed us  he couldnt see straight  well trim them down here saturday  no you wontnot without team work  lane youve got to have a manager  durn it  where re we goin to get one lane blurted out  you can sign me  i cant play but i know the game  let me coach the boys  the idea seemed to strike capt griffith favorably  he prevailed upon all the boys living on maddens hill to come out for practice after school  then he presented them to the managing coach  the boys were inclined to poke fun at daddy howarth and ridicule him but the idea was a novel one and they were in such a state of subjection from many beatings that they welcomed any change  willie sat on a bench improvised from a soap box and put them through a drill of batting and fielding  the next day in his coaching he included bunting and sliding  he played his men in different positions and for three more days he drove them unmercifully  when saturday came the day for the game with boggs farm a wild protest went up from the boys  willie experienced his first bitterness as a manager  out of forty aspirants for the maddens hill team he could choose but nine to play the game  and as a conscientious manager he could use no favorites  willie picked the best players and assigned them to positions that in his judgment were the best suited to them bob irvine wanted to play first base and he was down for right field sam wickhart thought he was the fastest fielder and willie had him slated to catch tom lindsays feelings were hurt because he was not to play in the infield  eddie curtis suffered a fall in pride when he discovered he was not down to play second base  jake thomas taytay mohler and brick grace all wanted to pitch  the manager had chosen frank price for that important position and franks one ambition was to be a shortstop  so there was a deadlock  for a while there seemed no possibility of a game  willie sat on the bench the center of a crowd of discontented quarreling boys  some were jealous some were outraged some tried to pacify and persuade the others  all were noisy  lane griffith stood by his manager and stoutly declared the players should play the positions to which they had been assigned or not at all  and he was entering into a hot argument with tom lindsay when the boggs farm team arrogantly put in an appearance  the way that team from the country walked out upon the field made a great difference  the spirit of maddens hill roused to battle  the game began swiftly and went on wildly  it ended almost before the hill boys realized it had commenced they did not know how they had won but they gave daddy howarth credit for it  they had a bonfire that night to celebrate the victory and they talked baseball until their parents became alarmed and hunted them up  maddens hill practiced all that next week and on saturday beat the seventh ward team  in four more weeks they had added half a dozen more victories to their record  their reputation went abroad  they got uniforms and baseball shoes with spikes and bats and balls and gloves  they got a mask but sam wickhart refused to catch with it  sam one of these days youll be stoppin a high inshoot with your eye sagely remarked daddy howarth  an then wherell i get a catcher for the natchez game  natchez was the one name on the lips of every maddens hill boy  for natchez had the great team of the town and roused by the growing repute of the hill club had condescended to arrange a game  when that game was scheduled for july fourth daddy howarth set to driving his men early and late he had them out  this manager in keeping with all other famous managers believed that batting was the thing which won games  he developed a hardhitting team  he kept everlastingly at them to hit and run hit and run  on the saturday before the fourth maddens hill had a game to play that did not worry daddy and he left his team in charge of the captain  fellers im goin down to the round house to see natchez play  ill size up their game said daddy  when he returned he was glad to find that his team had won its ninth straight victory but he was not communicative in regard to the playing of the natchez club  he appeared more than usually thoughtful  the fourth fell on tuesday  daddy had the boys out monday and he let them take only a short sharp practice  then he sent them home in his own mind daddy did not have much hope of beating natchez  he had been greatly impressed by their playing and one inning toward the close of the round house game they had astonished him with the way they suddenly seemed to break loose and deluge their opponents in a flood of hits and runs  he could not understand this streak of theirsfor they did the same thing every time they playedand he was too good a baseball student to call it luck  he had never wanted anything in his life not even to have two good legs as much as he wanted to beat natchez  for the maddens hill boys had come to believe him infallible  he was their idol they imagined they had only to hit and run to fight and never give up and daddy would make them win  there was not a boy on the team who believed that natchez had a chance  they had grown proud and tenacious of their dearly won reputation  first of all daddy thought of his team and their loyalty to him then he thought of the glory lately come to maddens hill and lastly of what it meant to him to have risen from a lonely watcher of the gamea cripple who could not even carry a batto manager of the famous hill team it might go hard with the boys to lose this game but it would break his heart  from time out of mind there had always been rivalry between maddens hill and natchez  and there is no rivalry so bitter as that between boys so daddy as he lay awake at night planning the system of play he wanted to use left out of all account any possibility of a peaceful game  it was comforting to think that if it came to a fight sam and lane could hold their own with bo stranathan and slugger blandy  in the managing of his players daddy observed strict discipline  it was no unusual thing for him to fine them  on practice days and off the field they implicitly obeyed him  during actual play however they had evinced a tendency to jump over the traces  it had been his order for them not to report at the field tuesday until 2 oclock he found it extremely difficult to curb his own inclination to start before the set time  and only the stern duty of a man to be an example to his players kept daddy at home  he lived near the ball grounds yet on this day as he hobbled along on his crutch he thought the distance interminably long and for the first time in weeks the old sickening resentment at his useless leg knocked at his heart  manfully daddy refused admittance to that old gloomy visitor he found comfort and forgetfulness in the thought that no strong and swiftlegged boy of his acquaintance could do what he could do  upon arriving at the field daddy was amazed to see such a large crowd it appeared that all the boys and girls in the whole town were in attendance and besides there was a sprinkling of grownup people interspersed here and there around the diamond  applause greeted daddys appearance and members of his team escorted him to the soapbox bench  daddy cast a sharp eye over the natchez players practicing on the field  bo stranathan had out his strongest team  they were not a prepossessing nine  they wore soiled uniforms that did not match in cut or color  but they pranced and swaggered and strutted  they were boastful and boisterous  it was a trial for any maddens hill boy just to watch them  wot a swelled bunch exclaimed tom lindsay  fellers if slugger blandy tries to pull any stunt on me today hell get a swelleder nut growled lane griffith  ttttttetetell him tttto keep out of mmmmy way an not bbbbblblock me stuttered taytay mohler  were agoin to skin em said eddie curtis  cheese it you kids till we git in the game ordered daddy  now maddens hill hang round an listen  i had to sign articles with natchezhad to let them have their umpire  so were up against it but well hit this pitcher muckle harris  he aint got any steam  an he aint got much nerve  now every feller who goes up to bat wants to talk to muck  call him a big swelled stiff  tell him he cant break a pane of glasstell him he cant put one over the pantell him it he does youll slam it down in the sand bank  bluff the whole team  keep scrappy all the time  see  thats my game today  this natchez bunch needs to be gone after  holler at the umpire  act like you want to fight  then daddy sent his men out for practice  boss enny ground rules inquired bo stranathan  he was a big bushyhaired boy with a grin and protruding teeth  how many bases on wild throws over first base an hits over the sand bank  all you can get replied daddy with a magnanimous wave of hand  huh  lemmee see your ball  daddy produced the ball that he had lane had made for the game  huh  watcher think  we ain t goin to play with no mush ball like thet protested bo  we play with a hard ball  looka here  well trow up the ball  daddy remembered what he had heard about the singular generosity of the natchez team to supply the balls for the games they played  we dont hev to pay nothin fer them balls a man down at the round house makes them for us  they aint no balls as good explained bo with pride  however as bo did not appear eager to pass over the balls for examination daddy simply reached out and took them  they were small perfectly round and as hard as bullets  they had no covers  the yarn had been closely and tightly wrapped and then stitched over with fine beeswaxed thread  daddy fancied he detected a difference in the weight of the ball but bo took them back before daddy could be sure of that point  you dont have to fan about it  i know a ball when i see one observed daddy  but were on our own grounds an well use our own ball thanks all the same to you stranathan  huh  all i gotta say is well play with my ball er there wont be no game said bo suddenly  daddy shrewdly eyed the natchez captain  bo did not look like a fellow wearing himself thin from generosity  it struck daddy that bos habit of supplying the ball for the game might have some relation to the fact that he always carried along his own umpire  there was a strange feature about this umpire business and it was that bos man had earned a reputation for being particularly fair  no boy ever had any real reason to object to umpire gales decisions  when gale umpired away from the natchez grounds his close decisions always favored the other team rather than his own  it all made daddy keen and thoughtful  stranathan up here on maddens hill we know how to treat visitors well play with your ball  now keep your gang of rooters from crowdin on the diamond  boss its your grounds  fire em off if they dont suit you come on lets git in the game  watcher wantfield er bat  field replied daddy briefly  billy gale called play and the game began with slugger blandy at bat  the formidable way in which he swung his club did not appear to have any effect on frank price or the player back of him  franks most successful pitch was a slow tantalizing curve and he used it  blandy lunged at the ball missed it and grunted  frank you got his alley called lane  slugger fouled the next one high in the air back of the plate  sam wickhart the stocky bowlegged catcher was a fiend for running after foul flies and now he plunged into the crowd of boys knocking them right and left and he caught the ball  whisner came up and hit safely over griffith whereupon the natchez supporters began to howl  kelly sent a grounder to grace at short stop  daddys weak player made a poor throw to first base so the runner was safe  then bo stranathan batted a stinging ball through the infield scoring whisner  play the batter  play the batter sharply called daddy from the bench  then frank struck out molloy and retired dundon on an easy fly  fellers git in the game now ordered daddy as his players eagerly trotted in  say things to that muckle harris  well walk through this game like sand through a sieve  bob irvin ran to the plate waving his bat at harris  put one over you freckleface  i ve been dyin fer this chanst youre on maddens hill now  muckle evidently was not the kind of pitcher to stand coolly under such bantering  obviously he was not used to it  his face grew red and his hair waved up  swinging hard he threw the ball straight at bobs head  quick as a cat bob dropped flat  never touched me he chirped jumping up and pounding the plate with his bat  you couldnt hit a barn door  come on  ill paste one a mile  bob did not get an opportunity to hit for harris could not locate the plate and passed him to first on four balls  dump the first one whispered daddy in graces ear  then he gave bob a signal to run on the first pitch  grace tried to bunt the first ball but he missed it  his attempt however was so violent that he fell over in front of the catcher who could not recover in time to throw and bob got to second base  at this juncture the maddens hill band of loyal supporters opened up with a mingling of shrill yells and whistles and jangling of tin cans filled with pebbles  grace hit the next ball into second base and while he was being thrown out bob raced to third  with sam wickhart up it looked good for a score and the crowd yelled louder  sam was awkward yet efficient and he batted a long fly to right field  the fielder muffed the ball  bob scored sam reached second base and the crowd yelled still louder  then lane struck out and mohler hit to shortstop retiring the side  natchez scored a run on a hit a base on balls and another error by grace  every time a ball went toward grace at short daddy groaned  in their half of the inning maddens hill made two runs increasing the score 3 to 2  the maddens hill boys began to show the strain of such a close contest  if daddy had voiced aloud his fear it would have been theyll blow up in a minnit  frank price alone was slow and cool and he pitched in masterly style natchez could not beat him  on the other hand maddens hill hit muck harris hard but superb fielding kept runners off the bases  as daddys team became more tense and excited bo stranathans players grew steadier and more arrogantly confident  daddy saw it with distress and he could not realize just where natchez had license for such confidence  daddy watched the game with the eyes of a hawk  as the natchez players trooped in for their sixth inning at bat daddy observed a marked change in their demeanor  suddenly they seemed to have been let loose they were like a band of indians  daddy saw everything  he did not miss seeing umpire gale take a ball from his pocket and toss it to frank and daddy wondered if that was the ball which had been in the play  straightway however he forgot that in the interest of the game  bo stranathan bawled  wull injuns hyars were we do em  weve jest ben loafin along  git ready to tear the air you rooters  kelly hit a wonderfully swift ball through the infield  bo batted out a single  malloy got up in the way of one of franks pitches and was passed to first base  then as the natchez crowd opened up in shrill clamor the impending disaster fell  dundon hit a bounder down into the infield the ball appeared to be endowed with life  it bounded low then high and cracking into graces hands bounced out and rolled away  the runners raced around the bases  pickens sent up a tremendous fly the highest ever batted on maddens hill  it went over tom lindsay in center field and tom ran and ran the ball went so far up that tom had time to cover the ground but he could not judge it  he ran round in a little circle with hands up in bewilderment  and when the ball dropped it hit him on the head and bounded away  run you injun run bawled bo  whatd i tell you  we aint got em goin oh no  hittin em on the head  bill dropped a slow teasing ball down the thirdbase line  jake thomas ran desperately for it and the ball appeared to strike his hands and run up his arms and caress his nose and wrap itself round his neck and then roll gently away  all the while the natchez runners tore wildly about the bases and the natchez supporters screamed and whistled  muck harris could not bat yet he hit the first ball and it shot like a bullet over the infield  then slugger blandy came to the plate  the ball he sent out knocked graces leg from under him as if it were a tenpin  whisner popped a fly over tay tay mohlers head  now tay tay was fat and slow but he was a sure catch  he got under the ball  it struck his hands and jumped back twenty feet up into the air  it was a strangely live ball  kelly again hit to shortstop and the ball appeared to start slow to gather speed with every bound and at last to dart low and shoot between graces legs  haw  haw roared bo  theyve got a hole at short  hit fer the hole fellers  watch me  jest watch me  and he swung hard on the first pitch  the ball glanced like a streak straight at grace took a vicious jump and seemed to flirt with the infielders hands only to evade them  malloy fouled a pitch and the ball hit sam wickhart square over the eye  sams eye popped out and assumed the proportions and color of a huge plum  hey yelled blandy the rival catcher  air you ketchin with yer mug  sam would not delay the game nor would he don the mask  daddy sat hunched on his soapbox and as in a hateful dream he saw his famous team go to pieces  he put his hands over his ears to shut out some of the uproar  and he watched that little yarn ball fly and shoot and bound and roll to crush his fondest hopes  not one of his players appeared able to hold it  and grace had holes in his hands and legs and body  the ball went right through him  he might as well have been so much water  instead of being a shortstop he was simply a hole after every hit daddy saw that ball more and more as something alive it sported with his infielders  it bounded like a huge jackrabbit and went swifter and higher at every bound  it was here there everywhere  and it became an infernal ball  it became endowed with a fiendish propensity to run up a players leg and all about him as if trying to hide in his pocket  graces efforts to find it were heartbreaking to watch  every time it bounded out to center field which was of frequent occurrence tom would fall on it and hug it as if he were trying to capture a fleeing squirrel  tay tay mohler could stop the ball but that was no great credit to him for his hands took no part in the achievement  tay tay was fat and the ball seemed to like him it boomed into his stomach and banged against his stout legs  when tay saw it coming he dropped on his knees and valorously sacrificed his anatomy to the cause of the game  daddy tried not to notice the scoring of runs by his opponents  but he had to see them and he had to count  ten runs were as ten blows after that each run scored was like a stab in his heart the play went on a terrible fusilade of wicked ground balls that baffled any attempt to field them then with nineteen runs scored natchez appeared to tire  sam caught a foul fly and tay tay by obtruding his wide person to the path of infield hits managed to stop them and throw out the runners  scorenatchez 21 madden hill 3  daddys boys slouched and limped wearily in  wot kind of a balls that panted tom as he showed his head with a bruise as large as a gooseegg  tttttatataytaytaytay began mohler in great excitement but as he could not finish what he wanted to say no one caught his meaning  daddys watchful eye had never left that wonderful infernal little yarn ball  daddy was crushed under defeat but his baseball brains still continued to work  he saw umpire gale leisurely step into the pitchers box and leisurely pick up the ball and start to make a motion to put it in his pocket  suddenly fire flashed all over daddy  hyar  dont hide that ball he yelled in his piercing tenor  he jumped up quickly forgetting his crutch and fell headlong  lane and sam got him upright and handed the crutch to him  daddy began to hobble out to the pitchers box  dont you hide that ball  see  ive got my eye on this game  that ball was in play an you cant use the other  umpire gale looked sheepish and his eyes did not meet daddys  then bo came trotting up  whats wrong boss he asked  aw nuthin  youre tryin to switch balls on me  thats all  you cant pull off any stunts on maddens hill  why boss thet balls all right  what you hollerin about  sure that balls all right replied daddy its a fine ball  an we want a chanst to hit it see  bo flared up and tried to bluster but daddy cut him short  give us our inninlet us git a whack at that ball or ill run you off maddens hill  bo suddenly looked a little pale and sick  course youse can git a whack at it he said in a weak attempt to be natural and dignified  daddy tossed the ball to harris and as he hobbled off the field he heard bo calling out low and cautiously to his players  then daddy was certain he had discovered a trick  he called his players around him  this game aint over yet  it aint any moren begun  ill tell you what  last innin bos umpire switched balls on us  that ball was lively an they tried to switch back on me  but nix were goin to git a chanst to hit that lively ball an theyre goin to git a dose of their own medicine  now you dead onescome back to life show me some hittin an runnin  daddy you mean they run in a trick on us demanded lane with flashing eyes  funny about natchezs strong finishes replied daddy coolly as he eyed his angry players  they let out a roar and then ran for the bats  the crowd quick to sense what was in the air thronged to the diamond and manifested alarming signs of outbreak  sam wickhart leaped to the plate and brandished his club  sam let him pitch a couple called daddy from the bench  mebbe well git wise then  harris had pitched only twice when the fact became plain that he could not throw this ball with the same speed as the other  the ball was heavier besides harris was also growing tired the next pitch sam hit far out over the center fielders head for a home run  it was a longer hit than any maddens hill boy had ever made the crowd shrieked its delight  sam crossed the plate and then fell on the bench beside daddy  say that ball nearly knocked the bat out of my hands panted sam it made the bat spring  fellers dont wait ordered daddy  dont give the umpire a chanst to roast us now  slam the first ball  the aggressive captain lined the ball at bo stranathan  the natchez shortstop had a fine opportunity to make the catch but he made an inglorious muff  tay tay hurried to bat  umpire gale called the first pitch a strike  tay slammed down his club  tttttototwasnt over he cried  ttttay  shut up yelled daddy  we want to git this game over today  tay tay was fat and he was also strong so that when beef and muscle both went hard against the ball it traveled  it looked as if it were going a mile straight up  all the infielders ran to get under it they got into a tangle into which the ball descended  no one caught it and thereupon the natchez players began to rail at one another bo stormed at them and they talked back to him then when tom lindsay hit a little slow grounder into the infield it seemed that a just retribution had overtaken the great natchez team  ordinarily this grounder of toms would have been easy for a novice to field  but this peculiar grounder after it has hit the ground once seemed to wake up and feel lively  it lost its leisurely action and began to have celerity  when it reached dundon it had the strange jerky speed so characteristic of the grounders that had confused the maddens hill team  dundon got his hands on the ball and it would not stay in them  when finally he trapped it tom had crossed first base and another runner had scored  eddie curtis cracked another at bo the natchez captain dove for it made a good stop bounced after the rolling ball and then threw to kelly at first  the ball knocked kellys hands apart as if they had been paper  jake thomas batted left handed and he swung hard on a slow pitch and sent the ball far into right field  runners scored  jakes hit was a threebagger  then frank price hit up an infield fly  bo yelled for dundon to take it and dundon yelled for harris  they were all afraid to try for it  it dropped safely while jake ran home  with the heavy batters up the excitement increased  a continuous scream and incessant rattle of tin cans made it impossible to hear what the umpire called out  but that was not important for he seldom had a chance to call either ball or strike  harris had lost his speed and nearly every ball he pitched was hit by the maddens hill boys  irvine cracked one down between short and third  bo and pickens ran for it and collided while the ball jauntily skipped out to left field and deftly evading bell went on and on  bob reached third  grace hit another at dundon who appeared actually to stop it four times before he could pick it up and then he was too late  the doughty bowlegged sam with his huge black eye hung over the plate and howled at muckle in the din no one heard what he said but evidently muck divined it for he roused to the spirit of a pitcher who would die of shame if he could not fool a oneeyed batter  but sam swooped down and upon the first ball and drove it back toward the pitcher  muck could not get out of the way and the ball made his leg buckle under him  then that hit glanced off to begin a marvelous exhibition of high and erratic bounding about the infield  daddy hunched over his soapbox bench and hugged himself  he was farsighted and he saw victory  again he watched the queer antics of that little yarn ball but now with different feelings every hit seemed to lift him to the skies  he kept silent though every time the ball fooled a natchez player daddy wanted to yell  and when it started for bo and as if in revenge bounded wickeder at every bounce to skip off the grass and make bo look ridiculous then daddy experienced the happiest moments of his baseball career  every time a tally crossed the plate he would chalk it down on his soap box  but when maddens hill scored the nineteenth run without a player being put out then daddy lost count  he gave himself up to revel  he sat motionless and silent nevertheless his whole internal being was in the state of wild tumult  it was as if he was being rewarded in joy for all the misery he had suffered because he was a cripple he could never play baseball but he had baseball brains  he had been too wise for the tricky stranathan  he was the coach and manager and general of the great maddens hill nine if ever he had to lie awake at night again he would not mourn over his lameness he would have something to think about  to him would be given the glory of beating the invincible natchez team  so daddy felt the last bitterness leave him  and he watched that strange little yarn ball with its wonderful skips and darts and curves  the longer the game progressed and the wearier harris grew the harder the maddens hill boys batted the ball and the crazier it bounced at bo and his sick players  finally tay tay mohler hit a teasing grounder down to bo  then it was as if the ball realizing a climax made ready for a final spurt  when bo reached for the ball it was somewhere else  dundon could not locate it  and kelly rushing down to the chase fell all over himself and his teammates trying to grasp the illusive ball and all the time tay tay was running  he never stopped  but as he was heavy and fat he did not make fast time on the bases  frantically the outfielders ran in to head off the bouncing ball and when they had succeeded tay tay had performed the remarkable feat of making a home run on a ball batted into the infield  that broke natchezs spirit  they quit  they hurried for their bats only bo remained behind a moment to try to get his yarn ball  but sam had pounced upon it and given it safely to daddy bo made one sullen demand for it  funny about them fast finishes of yours said daddy scornfully say the balls ourn  the winnin team gits the ball  go home an look up the rules of the game  bo slouched off the field to a shrill hooting and tin canning  fellers what was the score asked daddy  nobody knew the exact number of runs made by maddens hill  gimme a knife somebody said the manager  when it had been produced daddy laid down the yarn ball and cut into it  the blade entered readily for a inch and then stopped  daddy cut all around the ball and removed the cover of tightly wrapped yarn inside was a solid ball of india rubber  say it aint so funny nowhow that ball bounced remarked daddy  wot you think of that exclaimed tom feeling the lump on his head  ttttttttatr began tay tay mohler  say it  say it interrupted daddy  tatatatrtrimmed them wawawawawith their own bbbbbbababall finished tay    old wellwell  he bought a ticket at the 25cent window and edging his huge bulk through the turnstile laboriously followed the noisy crowd toward the bleachers i could not have been mistaken  he was old wellwell famous from boston to baltimore as the greatest baseball fan in the east  his singular yell had pealed into the ears of five hundred thousand worshippers of the national game and would never be forgotten  at sight of him i recalled a friends baseball talk  you remember old wellwell  hes all indying poor old fellow  it seems young burt whom the phillies are trying out this spring is old wellwells nephew and protege  used to play on the murray hill team a speedy youngster when the philadelphia team was here last manager crestline announced his intention to play burt in center field  old wellwell was too ill to see the lad get his tryout  he was heartbroken and said  if i could only see one more game  the recollection of this random baseball gossip and the fact that philadelphia was scheduled to play new york that very day gave me a sudden desire to see the game with old wellwell  i did not know him but where on earth were introductions as superfluous as on the bleachers  it was a very easy matter to catch up with him  he walked slowly leaning hard on a cane and his wide shoulders sagged as he puffed along  i was about to make some pleasant remark concerning the prospects of a fine game when the sight of his face shocked me and i drew back  if ever i had seen shadow of pain and shade of death they hovered darkly around old wellwell  no one accompanied him no one seemed to recognize him  the majority of that merry crowd of boys and men would have jumped up wild with pleasure to hear his wellremembered yell  not much longer than a year before i had seen ten thousand fans rise as one man and roar a greeting to him that shook the stands  so i was confronted by a situation strikingly calculated to rouse my curiosity and sympathy  he found an end seat on a row at about the middle of the rightfield bleachers and i chose one across the aisle and somewhat behind him no players were yet in sight  the stands were filling up and streams of men were filing into the aisles of the bleachers and piling over the benches old wellwell settled himself comfortably in his seat and gazed about him with animation  there had come a change to his massive features  the hard lines had softened the patches of gray were no longer visible his cheeks were ruddy something akin to a smile shone on his face as he looked around missing no detail of the familiar scene  during the practice of the home team old wellwell sat still with his big hands on his knees but when the gong rang for the phillies he grew restless squirming in his seat and half rose several times  i divined the importuning of his old habit to greet his team with the yell that had made him famous  i expected him to get up i waited for it  gradually however he became quiet as a man governed by severe selfrestraint and directed his attention to the philadelphia center fielder  at a glance i saw that the player was new to me and answered the newspaper description of young burt  what a lively looking athlete he was tall lithe yet sturdy  he did not need to chase more than two fly balls to win me  his graceful fast style reminded me of the great curt welch  old wellwells face wore a rapt expression  i discovered myself hoping burt would make good wishing he would rip the boards off the fence praying he would break up the game  it was saturday and by the time the gong sounded for the game to begin the grand stand and bleachers were packed  the scene was glittering colorful a delight to the eye  around the circle of bright faces rippled a low merry murmur  the umpire grotesquely padded in front by his chest protector announced the batteries dusted the plate and throwing out a white ball sang the open sesame of the game  play  then old wellwell arose as if pushed from his seat by some strong propelling force  it had been his wont always when play was ordered or in a moment of silent suspense or a lull in the applause or a dramatic pause when hearts heat high and lips were mute to bawl out over the listening waiting multitude his terrific blast wellwellwell  twice he opened his mouth gurgled and choked and then resumed his seat with a very red agitated face something had deterred him from his purpose or he had been physically incapable of yelling  the game opened with whites sharp bounder to the infield  wesley had three strikes called on him and kelly fouled out to third base  the phillies did no better being retired in one two three order  the second inning was short and no tallies were chalked up  brain hit safely in the third and went to second on a sacrifice  the bleachers began to stamp and cheer  he reached third on an infield hit that the philadelphia shortstop knocked down but could not cover in time to catch either runner  the cheer in the grand stand was drowned by the roar in the bleachers brain scored on a flyball to left  a double along the right foul line brought the second runner home  following that the next batter went out on strikes  in the philadelphia half of the inning young burt was the first man up he stood lefthanded at the plate and looked formidable  duveen the wary old pitcher for new york to whom this new player was an unknown quantity eyed his easy position as if reckoning on a possible weakness then he took his swing and threw the ball  burt never moved a muscle and the umpire called strike the next was a ball the next a strike still burt had not moved  somebody wake him up yelled a wag in the bleachers  hes from slumbertown all right all right shouted another  duveen sent up another ball high and swift burt hit straight over the first baseman a line drive that struck the front of the rightfield bleachers  peacherino howled a fan  here the promise of burts speed was fulfilled run  he was fleet as a deer  he cut through first like the wind settled to a driving strides rounded second and by a good long slide beat the throw in to third the crowd who went to games to see long hits and daring runs gave him a generous handclapping  old wellwell appeared on the verge of apoplexy his ruddy face turned purple then black he rose in his seat he gave vent to smothered gasps then he straightened up and clutched his hands into his knees  burt scored his run on a hit to deep short an infielders choice with the chances against retiring a runner at the plate  philadelphia could not tally again that inning  new york blanked in the first of the next  for their opponents an error a close decision at second favoring the runner and a single to right tied the score  bell of new york got a clean hit in the opening of the fifth with no one out and chances for a run the impatient fans let loose  four subway trains in collision would not have equalled the yell and stamp in the bleachers maloney was next to bat and he essayed a bunt  this the fans derided with hoots and hisses  no team work no inside ball for them  hit it out yelled a hundred in unison  home run screamed a worshipper of long hits  as if actuated by the sentiments of his admirers maloney lined the ball over short  it looked good for a double it certainly would advance bell to third maybe home  but no one calculated on burt  his fleetness enabled him to head the bounding ball  he picked it up cleanly and checking his headlong run threw toward third base bell was half way there  the ball shot straight and low with terrific force and beat the runner to the bag  what a great arm i exclaimed deep in my throat  its the lads day  he cant be stopped  the keen newsboy sitting below us broke the amazed silence in the bleachers  wot dye tink o that  old wellwell writhed in his seat  to him if was a oneman game as it had come to be for me i thrilled with him i gloried in the making good of his protege it got to be an effort on my part to look at the old man so keenly did his emotion communicate itself to me  the game went on a close exciting brilliantly fought battle  both pitchers were at their best the batters batted out long flies low liners and sharp grounders the fielders fielded these difficult chances without misplay  opportunities came for runs but no runs were scored for several innings  hopes were raised to the highest pitch only to be dashed astonishingly away  the crowd in the grand stand swayed to every pitched ball the bleachers tossed like surf in a storm  to start the eighth stranathan of new york tripled along the left foul line  thunder burst from the fans and rolled swellingly around the field  before the hoarse yelling the shrill hooting the hollow stamping had ceased stranathan made home on an infield hit  then bedlam broke loose  it calmed down quickly for the fans sensed trouble between binghamton who had been thrown out in the play and the umpire who was waving him back to the bench  you dizzyeyed old woman you cant see straight called binghamton  the umpires reply was lost but it was evident that the offending player had been ordered out of the grounds  binghamton swaggered along the bleachers while the umpire slowly returned to his post  the fans took exception to the players objection and were not slow in expressing it  various witty enconiums not to be misunderstood attested to the bleachers love of fair play and their disgust at a players getting himself put out of the game at a critical stage  the game proceeded  a second batter had been thrown out  then two hits in succession looked good for another run  white the next batter sent a single over second base  burt scooped the ball on the first bounce and let drive for the plate it was another extraordinary throw  whether ball or runner reached home base first was most difficult to decide  the umpire made his sweeping wave of hand and the breathless crowd caught his decision  out  in action and sound the circle of bleachers resembled a long curved beach with a mounting breaker thundering turbulently high  robbberr bawled the outraged fans betraying their marvelous inconsistency  old wellwell breathed hard  again the wrestling of his body signified an inward strife  i began to feel sure that the man was in a mingled torment of joy and pain that he fought the maddening desire to yell because he knew he had not the strength to stand it  surely in all the years of his long following of baseball he had never had the incentive to express himself in his peculiar way that rioted him now surely before the game ended he would split the winds with his wonderful yell  duveens only base on balls with the help of a bunt a steal and a scratch hit resulted in a run for philadelphia again tying the score how the fans raged at fuller for failing to field the lucky scratch  we had the game on ice one cried  get him a basket  new york men got on bases in the ninth and made strenuous efforts to cross the plate but it was not to be  philadelphia opened up with two scorching hits and then a double steal  burt came up with runners on second and third  half the crowd cheered in fair appreciation of the way fate was starring the ambitious young outfielder the other half dyedinthewool hometeam fans bent forward in a waiting silent gloom of fear  burt knocked the dirt out of his spikes and faced duveen the second ball pitched he met fairly and it rang like a bell  no one in the stands saw where it went  but they heard the crack saw the new york shortstop stagger and then pounce forward to pick up the ball and speed it toward the plate  the catcher was quick to tag the incoming runner and then snap the ball to first base completing a double play  when the crowd fully grasped this which was after an instant of bewilderment a hoarse crashing roar rolled out across the field to bellow back in loud echo from coogans bluff  the grand stand resembled a colored corn field waving in a violent wind the bleachers lost all semblance of anything  frenzied flinging actionwild chaosshrieking criesmanifested sheer insanity of joy  when the noise subsided one fan evidently a little longerwinded than his comrades cried out hysterically  oh  i dont care what becomes of menoww  score tied three to three game must go ten inningsthat was the shibboleth that was the overmastering truth  the game did go ten inningseleventwelve every one marked by masterly pitching full of magnificent catches stops and throws replete with reckless baserunning and slides like flashes in the dust  but they were unproductive of runs  three to three  thirteen innings  unlucky thirteenth wailed a superstitious fan  i had got down to plugging and for the first time not for my home team  i wanted philadelphia to win because burt was on the team with old wellwell sitting there so rigid in his seat so obsessed by the playing of the lad i turned traitor to new york  white cut a high twisting bounder inside the third base and before the ball could be returned he stood safely on second  the fans howled with what husky voice they had left  the second hitter batted a tremendously high fly toward center field burt wheeled with the crack of the ball and raced for the ropes  onward the ball soared like a sailing swallow the fleet fielder ran with his back to the stands what an age that ball stayed in the air  then it lost its speed gracefully curved and began to fall  burt lunged forward and upwards the ball lit in his hands and stuck there as he plunged over the ropes into the crowd  white had leisurely trotted half way to third he saw the catch ran back to touch second and then easily made third on the throwin  the applause that greeted burt proved the splendid spirit of the game  bell placed a safe little hit over short scoring white heaving bobbing bleacherswild broken roar on roar  score four to threeonly one half inning left for philadelphia to playhow the fans rooted for another run  a swift doubleplay however ended the inning  philadelphias first hitter had three strikes called on him  asleep at the switch yelled a delighted fan  the next batter went out on a weak popup fly to second  nothin to it  oh i hate to take this money  alll oover  two men at least of all that vast assemblage had not given up victory for philadelphia  i had not dared to look at old wellwell for a long while  i dreaded the nest portentious moment i felt deep within me something like clairvoyant force an intangible belief fostered by hope  magoon the slugger of the phillies slugged one against the left field bleachers but being heavy and slow he could not get beyond second base  cless swung with all his might at the first pitched ball and instead of hitting it a mile as he had tried he scratched a mean slow teasing grounder down the third base line  it was as safe as if it had been shot out of a cannon  magoon went to third  the crowd suddenly awoke to ominous possibilities sharp commands came from the players bench  the philadelphia team were bowling and hopping on the side lines and had to be put down by the umpire  an inbreathing silence fell upon stands and field quiet like a lull before a storm  when i saw young burt start for the plate and realized it was his turn at bat i jumped as if i had been shot  putting my hand on old wellwells shoulder i whispered  burts at bat hell break up this game  i know hes going to lose one  the old fellow did not feel my touch he did not hear my voice he was gazing toward the field with an expression on his face to which no human speech could render justice  he knew what was coming  it could not be denied him in that moment  how confidently young burt stood up to the plate  none except a natural hitter could have had his position  he might have been wagner for all he showed of the tight suspense of that crisis  yet there was a tense alert poise to his head and shoulders which proved he was alive to his opportunity  duveen plainly showed he was tired  twice he shook his head to his catcher as if he did not want to pitch a certain kind of ball  he had to use extra motion to get his old speed and he delivered a high straight ball that burt fouled over the grand stand  the second ball met a similar fate  all the time the crowd maintained that strange waiting silence  the umpire threw out a glistening white ball which duveen rubbed in the dust and spat upon  then he wound himself up into a knot slowly unwound and swinging with effort threw for the plate  burts lithe shoulders swung powerfully  the meeting of ball and bat fairly cracked  the low driving hit lined over second a rising glittering streak and went far beyond the center fielder  bleachers and stands uttered one short cry almost a groan and then stared at the speeding runners  for an instant approaching doom could not have been more dreaded  magoon scored cless was rounding second when the ball lit  if burt was running swiftly when he turned first he had only got started for then his long sprinters stride lengthened and quickened  at second he was flying beyond second he seemed to merge into a gray flitting shadow  i gripped my seat strangling the uproar within me  where was the applause  the fans were silent choked as i was but from a different cause cless crossed the plate with the score that defeated new york still the tension never laxed until burt beat the ball home in as beautiful a run as ever thrilled an audience  in the bleak dead pause of amazed disappointment old wellwell lifted his hulking figure and loomed towered over the bleachers  his wide shoulders spread his broad chest expanded his breath whistled as he drew it in  one fleeting instant his transfigured face shone with a glorious light  then as he threw back his head and opened his lips his face turned purple the muscles of his cheeks and jaw rippled and strung the veins on his forehead swelled into bulging ridges  even the back of his neck grew red  wellwellwell  earsplitting stentorian blast  for a moment i was deafened  but i heard the echo ringing from the cliff a pealing clarion call beautiful and wonderful winding away in hollow reverberation then breaking out anew from building to building in clear concatenation  a sea of faces whirled in the direction of that long unheard yell burt had stopped statuelike as if stricken in his tracks then he came running darting among the spectators who had leaped the fence  old wellwell stood a moment with slow glance lingering on the tumult of emptying bleachers on the moving mingling colors in the grand stand across the green field to the grayclad players he staggered forward and fell  before i could move a noisy crowd swarmed about him some solicitous many facetious young burt leaped the fence and forced his way into the circle  then they were carrying the old man down to the field and toward the clubhouse i waited until the bleachers and field were empty  when i finally went out there was a crowd at the gate surrounding an ambulance  i caught a glimpse of old wellwell  he lay white and still but his eyes were open smiling intently young burt hung over him with a pale and agitated face  then a bell clanged and the ambulance clattered away
