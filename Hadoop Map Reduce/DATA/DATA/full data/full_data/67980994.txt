political economy of art     preface   the greater part of the following treatise remains in the exact form in which it was read at manchester but the more familiar passages of it which were trusted to extempore delivery have been since written with greater explicitness and fullness than i could give them in speaking and a considerable number of notes are added to explain the points which could not be sufficiently considered in the time i had at my disposal in the lectureroom  some apology may be thought due to the reader for an endeavour to engage his attention on a subject of which no profound study seems compatible with the work in which i am usually employed but profound study is not in this case necessary either to writer or reader while accurate study up to a certain point is necessary for us all political economy means in plain english nothing more than citizens economy and its first principles ought therefore to be understood by all who mean to take the responsibility of citizens as those of household economy by all who take the responsibility of householders nor are its first principles in the least obscure they are many of them disagreeable in their practical requirements and people in general pretend that they cannot understand because they are unwilling to obey them or rather by habitual disobedience destroy their capacity of understanding them but there is not one of the really great principles of the science which is either obscure or disputablewhich might not be taught to a youth as soon as he can be trusted with an annual allowance or to a young lady as soon as she is of age to be taken into counsel by the housekeeper  i might with more appearance of justice be blamed for thinking it necessary to enforce what everybody is supposed to know but this fault will hardly be found with me while the commercial events recorded daily in our journals and still more the explanations attempted to be given of them show that a large number of our socalled merchants are as ignorant of the nature of money as they are reckless unjust and unfortunate in its employment  the statements of economical principle given in the text though i know that most if not all of them are accepted by existing authorities on the science are not supported by references because i have never read any author on political economy except adam smith twenty years ago1 whenever i have taken up any modern book upon this subject i have usually found it encumbered with inquiries into accidental or minor commercial results for the pursuit of which an ordinary reader could have no leisure and by the complication of which it seemed to me the authors themselves had been not unfrequently prevented from seeing to the root of the business      1 1857  finally if the reader should feel inclined to blame me for too sanguine a statement of future possibilities in political practice let him consider how absurd it would have appeared in the days of edward i if the present state of social economy had been then predicted as necessary or even described as possible and i believe the advance from the days of edward i to our own great as it is confessedly consists not so much in what we have actually accomplished as in what we are now enabled to conceive     lecture i   among the various characteristics of the age in which we live as compared with other ages of this not yet very experienced world one of the most notable appears to me to be the just and wholesome contempt in which we hold poverty i repeat the just and wholesome contempt though i see that some of my hearers look surprised at the expression i assure them i use it in sincerity and i should not have ventured to ask you to listen to me this evening unless i had entertained a profound respect for wealthtrue wealth that is to say for of course we ought to respect neither wealth nor anything else that is false of its kind and the distinction between real and false wealth is one of the points on which i shall have a few words presently to say to you but true wealth i hold as i said in great honour and sympathize for the most part with that extraordinary feeling of the present age which publicly pays this honour to riches i cannot however help noticing how extraordinary it is and how this epoch of ours differs from all bygone epochs in having no philosophical nor religious worshippers of the ragged godship of poverty in the classical ages not only there were people who voluntarily lived in tubs and who used gravely to maintain the superiority of tublife to townlife but the greeks and latins seem to have looked on these eccentric and i do not scruple to say absurd people with as much respect as we do upon large capitalists and landed proprietors so that really in those days no one could be described as purse proud but only as emptypurse proud and no less distinct than the honour which those curious greek people pay to their conceited poor is the disrespectful manner in which they speak of the rich so that one cannot listen long either to them or to the roman writers who imitated them without finding oneself entangled in all sorts of plausible absurdities hard upon being convinced of the uselessness of collecting that heavy yellow substance which we call gold and led generally to doubt all the most established maxims of political economy nor are matters much better in the middle ages for the greeks and romans contented themselves with mocking at rich people and constructing merry dialogues between charon and diogenes or menippus in which the ferryman and the cynic rejoiced together as they saw kings and rich men coming down to the shore of acheron in lamenting and lamentable crowds casting their crowns into the dark waters and searching sometimes in vain for the last coin out of all their treasures that could ever be of use to them but these pagan views of the matter were indulgent compared with those which were held in the middle ages when wealth seems to have been looked upon by the best men not only as contemptible but as criminal the purse round the neck is then one of the principal signs of condemnation in the pictured inferno and the spirit of poverty is reverenced with subjection of heart and faithfulness of affection like that of a loyal knight for his lady or a loyal subject for his queen and truly it requires some boldness to quit ourselves of these feelings and to confess their partiality or their error which nevertheless we are certainly bound to do for wealth is simply one of the greatest powers which can be entrusted to human hands a power not indeed to be envied because it seldom makes us happy but still less to be abdicated or despised while in these days and in this country it has become a power all the more notable in that the possessions of a rich man are not represented as they used to be by wedges of gold or coffers of jewels but by masses of men variously employed over whose bodies and minds the wealth according to its direction exercises harmful or helpful influence and becomes in that alternative mammon either of unrighteousness or of righteousness  now it seemed to me that since in the name you have given to this great gathering of british pictures you recognise them as treasuresthat is i suppose as part and parcel of the real wealth of the countryyou might not be uninterested in tracing certain commercial questions connected with this particular form of wealth most persons express themselves as surprised at its quantity not having known before to what an extent good art had been accumulated in england and it will therefore i should think be held a worthy subject of consideration what are the political interests involved in such accumulations what kind of labour they represent and how this labour may in general be applied and economized so as to produce the richest results  now you must have patience with me if in approaching the specialty of this subject i dwell a little on certain points of general political science already known or established for though thus as i believe established some which i shall have occasion to rest arguments on are not yet by any means universally accepted and therefore though i will not lose time in any detailed defence of them it is necessary that i should distinctly tell you in what form i receive and wish to argue from them and this the more because there may perhaps be a part of my audience who have not interested themselves in political economy as it bears on ordinary fields of labour but may yet wish to hear in what way its principles can be applied to art i shall therefore take leave to trespass on your patience with a few elementary statements in the outset and with the expression of some general principles here and there in the course of our particular inquiry  to begin then with one of these necessary truisms all economy whether of states households or individuals may be defined to be the art of managing labour the world is so regulated by the laws of providence that a mans labour well applied is always amply sufficient to provide him during his life with all things needful to him and not only with those but with many pleasant objects of luxury and yet farther to procure him large intervals of healthful rest and serviceable leisure and a nations labour well applied is in like manner amply sufficient to provide its whole population with good food and comfortable habitation and not with those only but with good education besides and objects of luxury art treasures such as these you have around you now but by those same laws of nature and providence if the labour of the nation or of the individual be misapplied and much more if it be insufficientif the nation or man be indolent and unwisesuffering and want result exactly in proportion to the indolence and improvidenceto the refusal of labour or to the misapplication of it wherever you see want or misery or degradation in this world about you there be sure either industry has been wanting or industry has been in error it is not accident it is not heavencommanded calamity it is not the original and inevitable evil of mans nature which fill your streets with lamentation and your graves with prey it is only that when there should have been providence there has been waste when there should have been labour there has been lasciviousness and wilfulness when there should have been subordination2      2 proverbs xiii 23 much food is in the tillage of the poor         but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment  now we have warped the word economy in our english language into a meaning which it has no business whatever to bear in our use of it it constantly signifies merely sparing or saving economy of money means saving moneyeconomy of time sparing time and so on but that is a wholly barbarous use of the wordbarbarous in a double sense for it is not english and it is bad greek barbarous in a treble sense for it is not english it is bad greek and it is worse sense economy no more means saving money than it means spending money it means the administration of a house its stewardship spending or saving that is whether money or time or anything else to the best possible advantage in the simplest and clearest definition of it economy whether public or private means the wise management of labour and it means this mainly in three senses namely first applying your labour rationally secondly preserving its produce carefully lastly distributing its produce seasonably  i say first applying your labour rationally that is so as to obtain the most precious things you can and the most lasting things by it not growing oats in land where you can grow wheat nor putting fine embroidery on a stuff that will not wear secondly preserving its produce carefully that is to say laying up your wheat wisely in storehouses for the time of famine and keeping your embroidery watchfully from the moth and lastly distributing its produce seasonably that is to say being able to carry your corn at once to the place where the people are hungry and your embroideries to the places where they are gay so fulfilling in all ways the wise mans description whether of the queenly housewife or queenly nation she riseth while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple strength and honour are in her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come  now you will observe that in this description of the perfect economist or mistress of a household there is a studied expression of the balanced division of her care between the two great objects of utility and splendour in her right hand food and flax for life and clothing in her left hand the purple and the needlework for honour and for beauty all perfect housewifery or national economy is known by these two divisions wherever either is wanting the economy is imperfect if the motive of pomp prevails and the care of the national economist is directed only to the accumulation of gold and of pictures and of silk and marble you know at once that the time must soon come when all these treasures shall be scattered and blasted in national ruin if on the contrary the element of utility prevails and the nation disdains to occupy itself in any wise with the arts of beauty or delight not only a certain quantity of its energy calculated for exercise in those arts alone must be entirely wasted which is bad economy but also the passions connected with the utilities of property become morbidly strong and a mean lust of accumulation merely for the sake of accumulation or even of labour merely for the sake of labour will banish at last the serenity and the morality of life as completely and perhaps more ignobly than even the lavishness of pride and the lightness of pleasure and similarly and much more visibly in private and household economy you may judge always of its perfectness by its fair balance between the use and the pleasure of its possessions you will see the wise cottagers garden trimly divided between its wellset vegetables and its fragrant flowers you will see the good housewife taking pride in her pretty tablecloth and her glittering shelves no less than in her welldressed dish and her full storeroom the care in her countenance will alternate with gaiety and though you will reverence her in her seriousness you will know her best by her smile  now as you will have anticipated i am going to address you on this and our succeeding evening chiefly on the subject of that economy which relates rather to the garden than the farmyard i shall ask you to consider with me the kind of laws by which we shall best distribute the beds of our national garden and raise in it the sweetest succession of trees pleasant to the sight and in no forbidden sense to be desired to make us wise but before proceeding to open this specialty of our subject let me pause for a few moments to plead with you for the acceptance of that principle of government or authority which must be at the root of all economy whether for use or for pleasure i said a few minutes ago that a nations labour well applied was amply sufficient to provide its whole population with good food comfortable clothing and pleasant luxury but the good instant and constant application is everything we must not when our strong hands are thrown out of work look wildly about for want of something to do with them if ever we feel that want it is a sign that all our household is out of order fancy a farmers wife to whom one or two of her servants should come at twelve oclock at noon crying that they had got nothing to do that they did not know what to do next and fancy still farther the said farmers wife looking hopelessly about her rooms and yard they being all the while considerably in disorder not knowing where to set the spare handmaidens to work and at last complaining bitterly that she had been obliged to give them their dinner for nothing thats the type of the kind of political economy we practise too often in england would you not at once assert of such a mistress that she knew nothing of her duties and would you not be certain if the household were rightly managed the mistress would be only too glad at any moment to have the help of any number of spare hands that she would know in an instant what to set them toin an instant what part of tomorrows work might be most serviceably forwarded what part of next months work most wisely provided for or what new task of some profitable kind undertaken and when the evening came and she dismissed her servants to their recreation or their rest or gathered them to the reading round the worktable under the eaves in the sunset would you not be sure to find that none of them had been overtasked by her just because none had been left idle that everything had been accomplished because all had been employed that the kindness of the mistress had aided her presence of mind and the slight labour had been entrusted to the weak and the formidable to the strong and that as none had been dishonoured by inactivity so none had been broken by toil  now the precise counterpart of such a household would be seen in a nation in which political economy was rightly understood you complain of the difficulty of finding work for your men depend upon it the real difficulty rather is to find men for your work the serious question for you is not how many you have to feed but how much you have to do it is our inactivity not our hunger that ruins us let us never fear that our servants should have a good appetiteour wealth is in their strength not in their starvation look around this island of yours and see what you have to do in it the sea roars against your harbourless cliffsyou have to build the breakwater and dig the port of refuge the unclean pestilence ravins in your streetsyou have to bring the full stream from the hills and to send the free winds through the thoroughfare the famine blanches your lips and eats away your fleshyou have to dig the moor and dry the marsh to bid the morass give forth instead of engulphing and to wring the honey and oil out of the rock these things and thousands such we have to do and shall have to do constantly on this great farm of ours for do not suppose that it is anything else than that precisely the same laws of economy which apply to the cultivation of a farm or an estate apply to the cultivation of a province or of an island whatever rebuke you would address to the improvident master of an illmanaged patrimony precisely that rebuke we should address to ourselves so far as we leave our population in idleness and our country in disorder what would you say to the lord of an estate who complained to you of his poverty and disabilities and when you pointed out to him that his land was half of it overrun with weeds and that his fences were all in ruin and that his cattlesheds were roofless and his labourers lying under the hedges faint for want of food he answered to you that it would ruin him to weed his land or to roof his shedsthat those were too costly operations for him to undertake and that he knew not how to feed his labourers nor pay them would you not instantly answer that instead of ruining him to weed his fields it would save him that his inactivity was his destruction and that to set his labourers to work was to feed them now you may add acre to acre and estate to estate as far as you like but you will never reach a compass of ground which shall escape from the authority of these simple laws the principles which are right in the administration of a few fields are right also in the administration of a great country from horizon to horizon idleness does not cease to be ruinous because it is extensive nor labour to be productive because it is universal  nay but you reply there is one vast difference between the nations economy and the private mans the farmer has full authority over his labourers he can direct them to do what is needed to be done whether they like it or not and he can turn them away if they refuse to work or impede others in their working or are disobedient or quarrelsome there is this great difference it is precisely this difference on which i wish to fix your attention for it is precisely this difference which you have to do away with we know the necessity of authority in farm or in fleet or in army but we commonly refuse to admit it in the body of the nation let us consider this point a little  in the various awkward and unfortunate efforts which the french have made at the development of a social system they have at least stated one true principle that of fraternity or brotherhood do not be alarmed they got all wrong in their experiments because they quite forgot that this fact of fraternity implied another fact quite as importantthat of paternity or fatherhood that is to say if they were to regard the nation as one family the condition of unity in that family consisted no less in their having a head or a father than in their being faithful and affectionate members or brothers but we must not forget this for we have long confessed it with our lips though we refuse to confess it in our lives for half an hour every sunday we expect a man in a black gown supposed to be telling us truth to address us as brethren though we should be shocked at the notion of any brotherhood existing among us out of church and we can hardly read a few sentences on any political subject without running a chance of crossing the phrase paternal government though we should be utterly horrorstruck at the idea of governments claiming anything like a fathers authority over us now i believe those two formal phrases are in both instances perfectly binding and accurate and that the image of the farm and its servants which i have hitherto used as expressing a wholesome national organization fails only of doing so not because it is too domestic but because it is not domestic enough because the real type of a wellorganized nation must be presented not by a farm cultivated by servants who wrought for hire and might be turned away if they refused to labour but by a farm in which the master was a father and in which all the servants were sons which implied therefore in all its regulations not merely the order of expediency but the bonds of affection and responsibilities of relationship and in which all acts and services were not only to be sweetened by brotherly concord but to be enforced by fatherly authority3      3 see note 1st in addenda p 86  observe i do not mean in the least that we ought to place such an authority in the hands of any one person or of any class or body of persons but i do mean to say that as an individual who conducts himself wisely must make laws for himself which at some time or other may appear irksome or injurious but which precisely at the time they appear most irksome it is most necessary he should obey so a nation which means to conduct itself wisely must establish authority over itself vested either in kings councils or laws which it must resolve to obey even at times when the law or authority appears irksome to the body of the people or injurious to certain masses of it and this kind of national law has hitherto been only judicial contented that is with an endeavour to prevent and punish violence and crime but as we advance in our social knowledge we shall endeavour to make our government paternal as well as judicial that is to establish such laws and authorities as may at once direct us in our occupations protect us against our follies and visit us in our distresses a government which shall repress dishonesty as now it punishes theft which shall show how the discipline of the masses may be brought to aid the toils of peace as discipline of the masses has hitherto knit the sinews of battle a government which shall have its soldiers of the ploughshare as well as its soldiers of the sword and which shall distribute more proudly its golden crosses of industrygolden as the glow of the harvest than now it grants its bronze crosses of honourbronzed with the crimson of blood  i have not of course time to insist on the nature or details of government of this kind only i wish to plead for your several and future consideration of this one truth that the notion of discipline and interference lies at the very root of all human progress or power that the let alone principle is in all things which man has to do with the principle of death that it is ruin to him certain and total if he lets his land aloneif he lets his fellowmen aloneif he lets his own soul alone that his whole life on the contrary must if it is healthy life be continually one of ploughing and pruning rebuking and helping governing and punishing and that therefore it is only in the concession of some great principle of restraint and interference in national action that he can ever hope to find the secret of protection against national degradation i believe that the masses have a right to claim education from their government but only so far as they acknowledge the duty of yielding obedience to their government i believe they have a right to claim employment from their governours but only so far as they yield to the governour the direction and discipline of their labour and it is only so far as they grant to the men whom they may set over them the fathers authority to check the childishnesses of national fancy and direct the waywardnesses of national energy that they have a right to ask that none of their distresses should be unrelieved none of their weaknesses unwatched and that no grief nor nakedness nor peril should exist for them against which the fathers hand was not outstretched or the fathers shield uplifted4      4 compare wordsworths essay on the poorlaw amendment bill         i quote one important passagebut if it be not safe to         touch the abstract question of mans right in a social state         to help himself even in the last extremity may we not still         contend for the duty of a christian government standing in         loco parentis towards all its subjects to make such         effectual provision that no one shall be in danger of         perishing either through the neglect or harshness of its         legislation or waiving this is it not indisputable that         the claim of the state to the allegiance involves the         protection of the subject and as all rights in one party         impose a correlative duty upon another it follows that the         right of the state to require the services of its members         even to the jeoparding of their lives in the common defence         establishes a right in the people not to be gainsaid by         utilitarians and economists to public support when from         any cause they may be unable to support themselvessee         note 2nd in addenda p 90  now i have pressed this upon you at more length than is needful or proportioned to our present purposes of inquiry because i would not for the first time speak to you on this subject of political economy without clearly stating what i believe to be its first grand principle but its bearing on the matter in hand is chiefly to prevent you from at once too violently dissenting from me when what i may state to you as advisable economy in art appears to imply too much restraint or interference with the freedom of the patron or artist we are a little apt though on the whole a prudent nation to act too immediately on our impulses even in matters merely commercial much more in those involving continual appeals to our fancies how far therefore the proposed systems or restraints may be advisable it is for you to judge only i pray you not to be offended with them merely because they are systems and restraints do you at all recollect that interesting passage of carlyle in which he compares in this country and at this day the understood and commercial value of man and horse and in which he wonders that the horse with its inferior brains and its awkward hoofiness instead of handiness should be always worth so many tens or scores of pounds in the market while the man so far from always commanding his price in the market would often be thought to confer a service on the community by simply killing himself out of their way well carlyle does not answer his own question because he supposes we shall at once see the answer the value of the horse consists simply in the fact of your being able to put a bridle on him the value of the man consists precisely in the same thing if you can bridle him or which is better if he can bridle himself he will be a valuable creature directly otherwise in a commercial point of view his value is either nothing or accidental only only of course the proper bridle of man is not a leathern one what kind of texture it is rightly made of we find from that command be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouths must be held in with bit and bridle you are not to be without the reins indeed but they are to be of another kind i will guide thee with mine eye so the bridle of man is to be the eye of god and if he rejects that guidance then the next best for him is the horses and the mules which have no understanding and if he rejects that and takes the bit fairly in his teeth then there is nothing left for him than the blood that comes out of the city up to the horsebridles  quitting however at last these general and serious laws of governmentor rather bringing them down to our own business in handwe have to consider three points of discipline in that particular branch of human labour which is concerned not with procuring of food but the expression of emotion we have to consider respecting art first how to apply our labour to it then how to accumulate or preserve the results of labour and then how to distribute them but since in art the labour which we have to employ is the labour of a particular class of menmen who have special genius for the business we have not only to consider how to apply the labour but first of all how to produce the labourer and thus the question in this particular case becomes fourfold first how to get your man of genius then how to employ your man of genius then how to accumulate and preserve his work in the greatest quantity and lastly how to distribute his work to the best national advantage let us take up these questions in succession   i discoveryhow are we to get our men of genius that is to say by what means may we produce among us at any given time the greatest quantity of effective artintellect a wide question you say involving an account of all the best means of art education yes but i do not mean to go into the consideration of those i want only to state the few principles which lie at the foundation of the matter of these the first is that you have always to find your artist not to make him you cant manufacture him any more than you can manufacture gold you can find him and refine him you dig him out as he lies nuggetfashion in the mountainstream you bring him home and you make him into current coin or household plate but not one grain of him can you originally produce a certain quantity of artintellect is born annually in every nation greater or less according to the nature and cultivation of the nation or race of men but a perfectly fixed quantity annually not increaseable by one grain you may lose it or you may gather it you may let it lie loose in the ravine and buried in the sands or you may make kings thrones of it and overlay temple gates with it as you choose but the best you can do with it is always merely sifting melting hammering purifyingnever creating and there is another thing notable about this artistical gold not only is it limited in quantity but in use you need not make thrones or golden gates with it unless you like but assuredly you cant do anything else with it you cant make knives of it nor armour nor railroads the gold wont cut you and it wont carry you put it to a mechanical use and you destroy it at once it is quite true that in the greatest artists their proper artistical faculty is united with every other and you may make use of the other faculties and let the artistical one lie dormant for aught i know there may be two or three leonardo da vincis employed at this moment in your harbours and railroads but you are not employing their leonardesque or golden faculty there you are only oppressing and destroying it and the artistical gift in average men is not joined with others your born painter if you dont make a painter of him wont be a firstrate merchant or lawyer at all events whatever he turns out his own special gift is unemployed by you and in no wise helps him in that other business so here you have a certain quantity of a particular sort of intelligence produced for you annually by providential laws which you can only make use of by setting it to its own proper work and which any attempt to use otherwise involves the dead loss of so much human energy well then supposing we wish to employ it how is it to be best discovered and refined it is easily enough discovered to wish to employ it is to discover it all that you need is a school of trial5 in every important town in which those idle farmers lads whom their masters never can keep out of mischief and those stupid tailors prentices who are always stitching the sleeves in wrong way upwards may have a try at this other trade only this school of trial must not be entirely regulated by formal laws of art education but must ultimately be the workshop of a good master painter who will try the lads with one kind of art and another till he finds out what they are fit for next after your trial school you want your easy and secure employment which is the matter of chief importance for even on the present system the boys who have really intense art capacity generally make painters of themselves but then the best half of their early energy is lost in the battle of life before a good painter can get employment his mind has always been embittered and his genius distorted a common mind usually stoops in plastic chill to whatever is asked of it and scrapes or daubs its way complacently into public favour6 but your great men quarrel with you and you revenge yourselves by starving them for the first half of their lives precisely in the degree in which any painter possesses original genius is at present the increase of moral certainty that during his early years he will have a hard battle to fight and that just at the time when his conceptions ought to be full and happy his temper gentle and his hopes enthusiasticjust at that most critical period his heart is full of anxieties and household cares he is chilled by disappointments and vexed by injustice he becomes obstinate in his errors no less than in his virtues and the arrows of his aims are blunted as the reeds of his trust are broken      5 see note 3rd in addenda p 95      6 see note 4th in addenda p 101  what we mainly want therefore is a means of sufficient and unagitated employment not holding out great prizes for which young painters are to scramble but furnishing all with adequate support and opportunity to display such power as they possess without rejection or mortification i need not say that the best field of labour of this kind would be presented by the constant progress of public works involving various decoration and we will presently examine what kind of public works may thus advantageously for the nation be in constant progress but a more important matter even than this of steady employment is the kind of criticism with which you the public receive the works of the young men submitted to you you may do much harm by indiscreet praise and by indiscreet blame but remember the chief harm is always done by blame it stands to reason that a young mans work cannot be perfect it must be more or less ignorant it must be more or less feeble it is likely that it may be more or less experimental and if experimental here and there mistaken if therefore you allow yourself to launch out into sudden barking at the first faults you see the probability is that you are abusing the youth for some defect naturally and inevitably belonging to that stage of his progress and that you might just as rationally find fault with a child for not being as prudent as a privy councillor or with a kitten for not being as grave as a cat but there is one fault which you may be quite sure is unnecessary and therefore a real and blameable fault that is haste involving negligence whenever you see that a young mans work is either bold or slovenly then you may attack it firmly sure of being right if his work is bold it is insolent repress his insolence if it is slovenly it is indolent spur his indolence so long as he works in that dashing or impetuous way the best hope for him is in your contempt and it is only by the fact of his seeming not to seek your approbation that you may conjecture he deserves it  but if he does deserve it be sure that you give it him else you not only run a chance of driving him from the right road by want of encouragement but you deprive yourselves of the happiest privilege you will ever have of rewarding his labour for it is only the young who can receive much reward from mens praise the old when they are great get too far beyond and above you to care what you think of them you may urge them then with sympathy and surround them then with acclamation but they will doubt your pleasure and despise your praise you might have cheered them in their race through the asphodel meadows of their youth you might have brought the proud bright scarlet into their faces if you had but cried once to them well done as they dashed up to the first goal of their early ambition but now their pleasure is in memory and their ambition is in heaven they can be kind to you but you never more can be kind to them you may be fed with the fruit and fullness of their old age but you were as the nipping blight to them in their blossoming and your praise is only as the warm winds of autumn to the dying branches  there is one thought still the saddest of all bearing on this withholding of early help it is possible in some noble natures that the warmth and the affections of childhood may remain unchilled though unanswered and that the old mans heart may still be capable of gladness when the longwithheld sympathy is given at last but in these noble natures it nearly always happens that the chief motive of earthly ambition has not been to give delight to themselves but to their parents every noble youth looks back as to the chiefest joy which this worlds honour ever gave him to the moment when first he saw his fathers eyes flash with pride and his mother turn away her head lest he should take her tears for tears of sorrow even the lovers joy when some worthiness of his is acknowledged before his mistress is not so great as that for it is not so purethe desire to exalt himself in her eyes mixes with that of giving her delight but he does not need to exalt himself in his parents eyes it is with the pure hope of giving them pleasure that he comes to tell them what he has done or what has been said of him and therefore he has a purer pleasure of his own and this purest and best of rewards you keep from him if you can you feed him in his tender youth with ashes and dishonour and then you come to him obsequious but too late with your sharp laurel crown the dew all dried from off its leaves and you thrust it into his languid hand and he looks at you wistfully what shall he do with it what can he do but go and lay it on his mothers grave  thus then you see that you have to provide for your young men first the searching or discovering school then the calm employment then the justice of praise one thing more you have to do for them in preparing them for full servicenamely to make in the noble sense of the word gentlemen of them that is to say to take care that their minds receive such training that in all they paint they shall see and feel the noblest things i am sorry to say that of all parts of an artists education this is the most neglected among us and that even where the natural taste and feeling of the youth have been pure and true where there was the right stuff in him to make a gentleman of you may too frequently discern some jarring rents in his mind and elements of degradation in his treatment of subject owing to want of gentle training and of the liberal influence of literature this is quite visible in our greatest artists even in men like turner and gainsborough while in the common grade of our secondrate painters the evil attains a pitch which is far too sadly manifest to need my dwelling upon it now no branch of art economy is more important than that of making the intellect at your disposal pure as well as powerful so that it may always gather for you the sweetest and fairest things the same quantity of labour from the same mans hand will according as you have trained him produce a lovely and useful work or a base and hurtful one and depend upon it whatever value it may possess by reason of the painters skill its chief and final value to any nation depends upon its being able to exalt and refine as well as to please and that the picture which most truly deserves the name of an arttreasure is that which has been painted by a good man  you cannot but see how far this would lead if i were to enlarge upon it i must take it up as a separate subject some other time only noticing at present that no money could be better spent by a nation than in providing a liberal and disciplined education for its painters as they advance into the critical period of their youth and that also a large part of their power during life depends upon the kind of subjects which you the public ask them for and therefore the kind of thoughts with which you require them to be habitually familiar i shall have more to say on this head when we come to consider what employment they should have in public buildings  there are many other points of nearly as much importance as these to be explained with reference to the development of genius but i should have to ask you to come and hear six lectures instead of two if i were to go into their detail for instance i have not spoken of the way in which you ought to look for those artificers in various manual trades who without possessing the order of genius which you would desire to devote to higher purposes yet possess wit and humour and sense of colour and fancy for formall commercially valuable as quantities of intellect and all more or less expressible in the lower arts of ironwork pottery decorative sculpture and such like but these details interesting as they are i must commend to your own consideration or leave for some future inquiry i want just now only to set the bearings of the entire subject broadly before you with enough of detailed illustration to make it intelligible and therefore i must quit the first head of it here and pass to the second namely how best to employ the genius we discover a certain quantity of able hands and heads being placed at our disposal what shall we most advisably set them upon   ii applicationthere are three main points the economist has to attend to in this  first to set his men to various work  secondly to easy work  thirdly to lasting work  i shall briefly touch on the first two for i want to arrest your attention on the last  i say first to various work supposing you have two men of equal power as landscape paintersand both of them have an hour at your disposal you would not set them both to paint the same piece of landscape you would of course rather have two subjects than a repetition of one  well supposing them sculptors will not the same rule hold you naturally conclude at once that it will but you will have hard work to convince your modern architects of that they will put twenty men to work to carve twenty capitals and all shall be the same if i could show you the architects yards in england just now all open at once perhaps you might see a thousand clever men all employed in carving the same design of the degradation and deathfulness to the artintellect of the country involved in such a habit i have more or less been led to speak before now but i have not hitherto marked its definite tendency to increase the price of work as such when men are employed continually in carving the same ornaments they get into a monotonous and methodical habit of labourprecisely correspondent to that in which they would break stones or paint housewalls of course what they do so constantly they do easily and if you excite them temporarily by an increase of wages you may get much work done by them in a little time but unless so stimulated men condemned to a monotonous exertion workand always by the laws of human nature must workonly at a tranquil rate not producing by any means a maximum result in a given time but if you allow them to vary their designs and thus interest their heads and hearts in what they are doing you will find them become eager first to get their ideas expressed and then to finish the expression of them and the moral energy thus brought to bear on the matter quickens and therefore cheapens the production in a most important degree sir thomas deane the architect of the new museum at oxford told me as i passed through oxford on my way here that he found that owing to this cause alone capitals of various design could be executed cheaper than capitals of similar design the amount of hand labour in each being the same by about 30 per cent  well that is the first way then in which you will employ your intellect well and the simple observance of this plain rule of political economy will effect a noble revolution in your architecture such as you cannot at present so much as conceive then the second way in which we are to guard against waste is by setting our men to the easiest and therefore the quickest work which will answer the purpose marble for instance lasts quite as long as granite and is much softer to work therefore when you get hold of a good sculptor give him marble to carvenot granite that you say is obvious enough yes but it is not so obvious how much of your workmens time you waste annually in making them cut glass after it has got hard when you ought to make them mould it while it is soft it is not so obvious how much expense you waste in cutting diamonds and rubies which are the hardest things you can find into shapes that mean nothing when the same men might be cutting sandstone and freestone into shapes that meant something it is not so obvious how much of the artists time in italy you waste by forcing them to make wretched little pictures for you out of crumbs of stone glued together at enormous cost when the tenth of the time would make good and noble pictures for you out of watercolour i could go on giving you almost numberless instances of this great commercial mistake but i should only weary and confuse you i therefore commend also this head of our subject to your own meditation and proceed to the last i namedthe last i shall task your patience with tonight you know we are now considering how to apply our genius and we were to do it as economists in three ways    to various work   to easy work   to lasting work  this lasting of the work then is our final question  many of you may perhaps remember that michael angelo was once commanded by pietro di medici to mould a statue out of snow and that he obeyed the command7 i am glad and we have all reason to be glad that such a fancy ever came into the mind of the unworthy prince and for this cause that pietro di medici then gave at the period of one great epoch of consummate power in the arts the perfect accurate and intensest possible type of the greatest error which nations and princes can commit respecting the power of genius entrusted to their guidance you had there observe the strongest genius in the most perfect obedience capable of iron independence yet wholly submissive to the patrons will at once the most highly accomplished and the most original capable of doing as much as man could do in any direction that man could ask and its governour and guide and patron sets it to build a statue in snowto put itself into the service of annihilationto make a cloud of itself and pass away from the earth      7 see the noble passage on this tradition in casa guidi         windows  now this so precisely and completely done by pietro di medici is what we are all doing exactly in the degree in which we direct the genius under our patronage to work in more or less perishable materials so far as we induce painters to work in fading colours or architects to build with imperfect structure or in any other way consult only immediate ease and cheapness in the production of what we want to the exclusion of provident thought as to its permanence and serviceableness in after ages so far we are forcing our michael angelos to carve in snow the first duty of the economist in art is to see that no intellect shall thus glitter merely in the manner of hoarfrost but that it shall be well vitrified like a painted window and shall be set so between shafts of stone and bands of iron that it shall bear the sunshine upon it and send the sunshine through it from generation to generation  i can conceive however some political economist to interrupt me here and say if you make your art wear too well you will soon have too much of it you will throw your artists quite out of work better allow for a little wholesome evanescencebeneficent destruction let each age provide art for itself or we shall soon have so many good pictures that we shall not know what to do with them  remember my dear hearers who are thus thinking that political economy like every other subject cannot be dealt with effectively if we try to solve two questions at a time instead of one it is one question how to get plenty of a thing and another whether plenty of it will be good for us consider these two matters separately never confuse yourself by interweaving one with the other it is one question how to treat your fields so as to get a good harvest another whether you wish to have a good harvest or would rather like to keep up the price of corn it is one question how to graft your trees so as to grow most apples and quite another whether having such a heap of apples in the storeroom will not make them all rot  now therefore that we are talking only about grafting and growing pray do not vex yourselves with thinking what you are to do with the pippins it may be desirable for us to have much art or littlewe will examine that by and by but just now let us keep to the simple consideration how to get plenty of good art if we want it perhaps it might be just as well that a man of moderate income should be able to possess a good picture as that any work of real merit should cost £500 or £1000 at all events it is certainly one of the branches of political economy to ascertain how if we like we can get things in quantitiesplenty of corn plenty of wine plenty of gold or plenty of pictures  it has just been said that the first great secret is to produce work that will last now the conditions of work lasting are twofold it must not only be in materials that will last but it must be itself of a quality that will lastit must be good enough to bear the test of time if it is not good we shall tire of it quickly and throw it asidewe shall have no pleasure in the accumulation of it so that the first question of a good arteconomist respecting any work is will it lose its flavour by keeping it may be very amusing now and look much like a work of genius but what will be its value a hundred years hence  you cannot always ascertain this you may get what you fancy to be work of the best quality and yet find to your astonishment that it wont keep but of one thing you may be sure that art which is produced hastily will also perish hastily and that what is cheapest to you now is likely to be dearest in the end  i am sorry to say the great tendency of this age is to expend its genius in perishable art of this kind as if it were a triumph to burn its thoughts away in bonfires there is a vast quantity of intellect and of labour consumed annually in our cheap illustrated publications you triumph in them and you think it is so grand a thing to get so many woodcuts for a penny why woodcuts penny and all are as much lost to you as if you had invested your money in gossamer more lost for the gossamer could only tickle your face and glitter in your eyes it could not catch your feet and trip you up but the bad art can and does for you cant like good woodcuts as long as you look at the bad ones if we were at this moment to come across a titian woodcut or a durer woodcut we should not like itthose of us at least who are accustomed to the cheap work of the day we dont like and cant like that long but when we are tired of one bad cheap thing we throw it aside and buy another bad cheap thing and so keep looking at bad things all our lives now the very men who do all that quick bad work for us are capable of doing perfect work only perfect work cant be hurried and therefore it cant be cheap beyond a certain point but suppose you pay twelve times as much as you do now and you have one woodcut for a shilling instead of twelve and the one woodcut for a shilling is as good as art can be so that you will never tire of looking at it and is struck on good paper with good ink so that you will never wear it out by handling it while you are sick of your pennyeach cuts by the end of the week and have torn them mostly in half too isnt your shillings worth the best bargain  it is not however only in getting prints or woodcuts of the best kind that you will practise economy there is a certain quality about an original drawing which you cannot get in a woodcut and the best part of the genius of many men is only expressible in original work whether with pen and inkpencil or colours this is not always the case but in general the best men are those who can only express themselves on paper or canvass and you will therefore in the long run get most for your money by buying original work proceeding on the principle already laid down that the best is likely to be the cheapest in the end of course original work cannot be produced under a certain cost if you want a man to make you a drawing which takes him six days you must at all events keep him for six days in bread and water fire and lodging that is the lowest price at which he can do it for you but that is not very dear and the best bargain which can possibly be made honestly in artthe very ideal of a cheap purchase to the purchaseris the original work of a great man fed for as many days as are necessary on bread and water or perhaps we may say with as many onions as will keep him in good humour that is the way by which you will always get most for your money no mechanical multiplication or ingenuity of commercial arrangements will ever get you a better pennys worth of art than that  without however pushing our calculations quite to this prisondiscipline extreme we may lay it down as a rule in arteconomy that original work is on the whole cheapest and best worth having but precisely in proportion to the value of it as a production becomes the importance of having it executed in permanent materials and here we come to note the second main error of the day that we not only ask our workmen for bad art but we make them put it into bad substance we have for example put a great quantity of genius within the last twenty years into watercolour drawing and we have done this with the most reckless disregard whether either the colours or the paper will stand in most instances neither will by accident it may happen that the colours in a given drawing have been of good quality and its paper uninjured by chemical processes but you take not the least care to ensure these being so i have myself seen the most destructive changes take place in watercolour drawings within twenty years after they were painted and from all i can gather respecting the recklessness of modern paper manufacture my belief is that though you may still handle an albert durer engraving two hundred years old fearlessly not onehalf of that time will have passed over your modern watercolours before most of them will be reduced to mere white or brown rags and your descendants twitching them contemptuously into fragments between finger and thumb will mutter against you half in scorn and half in anger those wretched nineteenthcentury people they kept vapouring and fuming about the world doing what they called business and they couldnt make a sheet of paper that wasnt rotten and note that this is no unimportant portion of your art economy at this time your watercolour painters are becoming every day capable of expressing greater and better things and their material is especially adapted to the turn of your best artists minds the value which you could accumulate in work of this kind would soon become a most important item in the national artwealth if only you would take the little pains necessary to secure its permanence i am inclined to think myself that watercolour ought not to be used on paper at all but only on vellum and then if properly taken care of the drawing would be almost imperishable still paper is a much more convenient material for rapid work and it is an infinite absurdity not to secure the goodness of its quality when we could do so without the slightest trouble among the many favours which i am going to ask from our paternal government when we get it will be that it will supply its little boys with good paper you have nothing to do but to let the government establish a paper manufactory under the superintendence of any of our leading chemists who should be answerable for the safety and completeness of all the processes of the manufacture the government stamp on the corner of your sheet of drawingpaper made in the perfect way should cost you a shilling which would add something to the revenue and when you bought a watercolour drawing for fifty or a hundred guineas you would have merely to look in the corner for your stamp and pay your extra shilling for the security that your hundred guineas were given really for a drawing and not for a coloured rag there need be no monopoly or restriction in the matter let the paper manufacturers compete with the government and if people liked to save their shilling and take their chance let them only the artist and purchaser might then be sure of good material if they liked and now they cannot be  i should like also to have a government colour manufactory though that is not so necessary as the quality of colour is more within the artists power of testing and i have no doubt that any painter may get permanent colour from the respectable manufacturers if he chooses i will not attempt to follow the subject out at all as it respects architecture and our methods of modern building respecting which i have had occasion to speak before now  but i cannot pass without some brief notice our habitcontinually as it seems to me gaining strengthof putting a large quantity of thought and work annually into things which are either in their nature necessarily perishable as dress or else into compliances with the fashion of the day in things not necessarily perishable as plate i am afraid almost the first idea of a young rich couple setting up house in london is that they must have new plate their fathers plate may be very handsome but the fashion is changed they will have a new service from the leading manufacturer and the old plate except a few apostle spoons and a cup which charles the second drank a health in to their pretty ancestress is sent to be melted down and made up with new flourishes and fresh lustre now so long as this is the caseso long observe as fashion has influence on the manufacture of plateso long you cannot have a goldsmiths art in this country do you suppose any workman worthy the name will put his brains into a cup or an urn which he knows is to go to the melting pot in half a score years he will not you dont ask or expect it of him you ask of him nothing but a little quick handicrafta clever twist of a handle here and a foot there a convolvulus from the newest school of design a pheasant from landseers game cards a couple of sentimental figures for supporters in the style of the signs of insurance offices then a clever touch with the burnisher and theres your epergne the admiration of all the footmen at the weddingbreakfast and the torment of some unfortunate youth who cannot see the pretty girl opposite to him through its tyrannous branches  but you dont suppose that thats goldsmiths work goldsmiths work is made to last and made with the mans whole heart and soul in it true goldsmiths work when it exists is generally the means of education of the greatest painters and sculptors of the day francia was a goldsmith francia was not his own name but that of his master the jeweller and he signed his pictures almost always francia the goldsmith for love of his master ghirlandajo was a goldsmith and was the master of michael angelo verrocchio was a goldsmith and was the master of leonardo da vinci ghiberti was a goldsmith and beat out the bronze gates which michael angelo said might serve for gates of paradise8 but if ever you want work like theirs again you must keep it though it should have the misfortune to become old fashioned you must not break it up nor melt it any more there is no economy in that you could not easily waste intellect more grievously nature may melt her goldsmiths work at every sunset if she chooses and beat it out into chased bars again at every sunrise but you must not the way to have a truly noble service of plate is to keep adding to it not melting it at every marriage and at every birth get a new piece of gold or silver if you will but with noble workmanship on it done for all time and put it among your treasures that is one of the chief things which gold was made for and made incorruptible for when we know a little more of political economy we shall find that none but partially savage nations need imperatively gold for their currency9 but gold has been given us among other things that we might put beautiful work into its imperishable splendour and that the artists who have the most wilful fancies may have a material which will drag out and beat out as their dreams require and will hold itself together with fantastic tenacity whatever rare and delicate service they set it upon      8 several reasons may account for the fact that goldsmiths         work is so wholesome for young artists first that it gives         great firmness of hand to deal for some time with a solid         substance again that it induces caution and steadinessa         boy trusted with chalk and paper suffers an immediate         temptation to scrawl upon it and play with it but he dares         not scrawl on gold and he cannot play with it and lastly         that it gives great delicacy and precision of touch to work         upon minute forms and to aim at producing richness and         finish of design correspondent to the preciousness of the         material      9 see note in addenda on the nature of property p 107  so here is one branch of decorative art in which rich people may indulge themselves unselfishly if they ask for good art in it they may be sure in buying gold and silver plate that they are enforcing useful education on young artists but there is another branch of decorative art in which i am sorry to say we cannot at least under existing circumstances indulge ourselves with the hope of doing good to anybody i mean the great and subtle art of dress  and here i must interrupt the pursuit of our subject for a moment or two in order to state one of the principles of political economy which though it is i believe now sufficiently understood and asserted by the leading masters of the science is not yet i grieve to say acted upon by the plurality of those who have the management of riches whenever we spend money we of course set people to work that is the meaning of spending money we may indeed lose it without employing anybody but whenever we spend it we set a number of people to work greater or less of course according to the rate of wages but in the long run proportioned to the sum we spend well your shallow people because they see that however they spend money they are always employing somebody and therefore doing some good think and say to themselves that it is all one how they spend itthat all their apparently selfish luxury is in reality unselfish and is doing just as much good as if they gave all their money away or perhaps more good and i have heard foolish people even declare it as a principle of political economy that whoever invented a new want10 conferred a good on the community i have not words strong enoughat least i could not without shocking you use the words which would be strong enoughto express my estimate of the absurdity and the mischievousness of this popular fallacy so putting a great restraint upon myself and using no hard words i will simply try to state the nature of it and the extent of its influence     10 see note 5th in addenda p 102  granted that whenever we spend money for whatever purpose we set people to work and passing by for the moment the question whether the work we set them to is all equally healthy and good for them we will assume that whenever we spend a guinea we provide an equal number of people with healthy maintenance for a given time but by the way in which we spend it we entirely direct the labour of those people during that given time we become their masters or mistresses and we compel them to produce within a certain period a certain article now that article may be a useful and lasting one or it may be a useless and perishable oneit may be one useful to the whole community or useful only to ourselves and our selfishness and folly or our virtue and prudence are shown not by our spending money but by our spending it for the wrong or the right thing and we are wise and kind not in maintaining a certain number of people for a given period but only in requiring them to produce during that period the kind of things which shall be useful to society instead of those which are only useful to ourselves  thus for instance if you are a young lady and employ a certain number of sempstresses for a given time in making a given number of simple and serviceable dresses suppose seven of which you can wear one yourself for half the winter and give six away to poor girls who have none you are spending your money unselfishly but if you employ the same number of sempstresses for the same number of days in making four or five or six beautiful flounces for your own balldressflounces which will clothe no one but yourself and which you will yourself be unable to wear at more than one ballyou are employing your money selfishly you have maintained indeed in each case the same number of people but in the one case you have directed their labour to the service of the community in the other case you have consumed it wholly upon yourself i dont say you are never to do so i dont say you ought not sometimes to think of yourselves only and to make yourselves as pretty as you can only do not confuse coquettishness with benevolence nor cheat yourselves into thinking that all the finery you can wear is so much put into the hungry mouths of those beneath you it is not so it is what you yourselves whether you will or no must sometimes instinctively feel it to beit is what those who stand shivering in the streets forming a line to watch you as you step out of your carriages know it to be those fine dresses do not mean that so much has been put into their mouths but that so much has been taken out of their mouths the real politicoeconomical signification of every one of those beautiful toilettes is just this that you have had a certain number of people put for a certain number of days wholly under your authority by the sternest of slavemastershunger and cold and you have said to them i will feed you indeed and clothe you and give you fuel for so many days but during those days you shall work for me only your little brothers need clothes but you shall make none for them your sick friend needs clothes but you shall make none for her you yourself will soon need another and a warmer dress but you shall make none for yourself you shall make nothing but lace and roses for me for this fortnight to come you shall work at the patterns and petals and then i will crush and consume them away in an hour you will perhaps answerit may not be particularly benevolent to do this and we wont call it so but at any rate we do no wrong in taking their labour when we pay them their wages if we pay for their work we have a right to it noa thousand times no the labour which you have paid for does indeed become by the act of purchase your own labour you have bought the hands and the time of those workers they are by right and justice your own hands your own time but have you a right to spend your own time to work with your own hands only for your own advantagemuch more when by purchase you have invested your own person with the strength of others and added to your own life a part of the life of others you may indeed to a certain extent use their labour for your delight remember i am making no general assertions against splendour of dress or pomp of accessories of life on the contrary there are many reasons for thinking that we do not at present attach enough importance to beautiful dress as one of the means of influencing general taste and character but i do say that you must weigh the value of what you ask these workers to produce for you in its own distinct balance that on its own worthiness or desirableness rests the question of your kindness and not merely on the fact of your having employed people in producing it and i say farther that as long as there are cold and nakedness in the land around you so long there can be no question at all but that splendour of dress is a crime in due time when we have nothing better to set people to work at it may be right to let them make lace and cut jewels but as long as there are any who have no blankets for their beds and no rags for their bodies so long it is blanketmaking and tailoring we must set people to work atnot lace  and it would be strange if at any great assembly which while it dazzled the young and the thoughtless beguiled the gentler hearts that beat beneath the embroidery with a placid sensation of luxurious benevolenceas if by all that they wore in waywardness of beauty comfort had been first given to the distressed and aid to the indigent it would be strange i say if for a moment the spirits of truth and of terror which walk invisibly among the masques of the earth would lift the dimness from our erring thoughts and show us howinasmuch as the sums exhausted for that magnificence would have given back the failing breath to many an unsheltered outcast on moor and streetthey who wear it have literally entered into partnership with death and dressed themselves in his spoils yes if the veil could be lifted not only from your thoughts but from your human sight you would seethe angels do seeon those gay white dresses of yours strange dark spots and crimson patterns that you knew not ofspots of the inextinguishable red that all the seas cannot wash away yes and among the pleasant flowers that crown your fair heads and glow on your wreathed hair you would see that one weed was always twisted which no one thought ofthe grass that grows on graves  it was not however this last this clearest and most appalling view of our subject that i intended to ask you to take this evening only it is impossible to set any part of the matter in its true light until we go to the root of it but the point which it is our special business to consider is not whether costliness of dress is contrary to charity but whether it is not contrary to mere worldly wisdom whether even supposing we knew that splendour of dress did not cost suffering or hunger we might not put the splendour better in other things than dress and supposing our mode of dress were really graceful or beautiful this might be a very doubtful question for i believe true nobleness of dress to be an important means of education as it certainly is a necessity to any nation which wishes to possess living art concerned with portraiture of human nature no good historical painting ever yet existed or ever can exist where the dresses of the people of the time are not beautiful and had it not been for the lovely and fantastic dressing of the 13th to the 16th centuries neither french nor florentine nor venetian art could have risen to anything like the rank it reached still even then the best dressing was never the costliest and its effect depended much more on its beautiful and in early times modest arrangement and on the simple and lovely masses of its colour than on gorgeousness of clasp or embroidery whether we can ever return to any of those more perfect types of form is questionable but there can be no question that all the money we spend on the forms of dress at present worn is so far as any good purpose is concerned wholly lost mind in saying this i reckon among good purposes the purpose which young ladies are said sometimes to entertainof being married but they would be married quite as soon and probably to wiser and better husbands by dressing quietly as by dressing brilliantly and i believe it would only be needed to lay fairly and largely before them the real good which might be effected by the sums they spend in toilettes to make them trust at once only to their bright eyes and braided hair for all the mischief they have a mind to i wish we could for once get the statistics of a london season there was much complaining talk in parliament last week of the vast sum the nation has given for the best paul veronese in venice£14000 i wonder what the nation meanwhile has given for its balldresses suppose we could see the london milliners bills simply for unnecessary breadths of slip and flounce from april to july i wonder whether £14000 would cover them but the breadths of slip and flounce are by this time as much lost and vanished as last years snow only they have done less good but the paul veronese will last for centuries if we take care of it and yet we grumble at the price given for the painting while no one grumbles at the price of pride  time does not permit me to go into any farther illustration of the various modes in which we build our statue out of snow and waste our labour on things that vanish i must leave you to follow out the subject for yourselves as i said i should and proceed in our next lecture to examine the two other branches of our subject namely how to accumulate our art and how to distribute it but in closing as we have been much on the topic of good government both of ourselves and others let me just give you one more illustration of what it means from that old art of which next evening i shall try to convince you that the value both moral and mercantile is greater than we usually suppose  one of the frescoes by ambrozio lorenzetti in the townhall of siena represents by means of symbolical figures the principles of good civic government and of good government in general the figure representing this noble civic government is enthroned and surrounded by figures representing the virtues variously supporting or administering its authority now observe what work is given to each of these virtues three winged onesfaith hope and charitysurround the head of the figure not in mere compliance with the common and heraldic laws of precedence among virtues such as we moderns observe habitually but with peculiar purpose on the part of the painter faith as thus represented ruling the thoughts of the good governour does not mean merely religious faith understood in those times to be necessary to all personsgoverned no less than governoursbut it means the faith which enables work to be carried out steadily in spite of adverse appearances and expediencies the faith in great principles by which a civic ruler looks past all the immediate checks and shadows that would daunt a common man knowing that what is rightly done will have a right issue and holding his way in spite of pullings at his cloak and whisperings in his ear enduring as having in him a faith which is evidence of things unseen and hope in like manner is here not the heavenward hope which ought to animate the hearts of all men but she attends upon good government to show that all such government is expectant as well as conservative that if it ceases to be hopeful of better things it ceases to be a wise guardian of present things that it ought never as long as the world lasts to be wholly content with any existing state of institution or possession but to be hopeful still of more wisdom and power not clutching at it restlessly or hastily but feeling that its real life consists in steady ascent from high to higher conservative indeed and jealously conservative of old things but conservative of them as pillars not as pinnaclesas aids but not as idols and hopeful chiefly and active in times of national trial or distress according to those first and notable words describing the queenly nation she riseth while it is yet night and again the winged charity which is attendant on good government has in this fresco a peculiar office can you guess what if you consider the character of contest which so often takes place among kings for their crowns and the selfish and tyrannous means they commonly take to aggrandize or secure their power you will perhaps be surprised to hear that the office of charity is to crown the king and yet if you think of it a little you will see the beauty of the thought which sets her in this function since in the first place all the authority of a good governor should be desired by him only for the good of his people so that it is only love that makes him accept or guard his crown in the second place his chief greatness consists in the exercise of this love and he is truly to be revered only so far as his acts and thoughts are those of kindness so that love is the light of his crown as well as the giver of it lastly because his strength depends on the affections of his people and it is only their love which can securely crown him and for ever so that love is the strength of his crown as well as the light of it  then surrounding the king or in various obedience to him appear the dependent virtues as fortitude temperance truth and other attendant spirits of all which i cannot now give account wishing you only to notice the one to whom are entrusted the guidance and administration of the public revenues can you guess which it is likely to be charity you would have thought should have something to do with the business but not so for she is too hot to attend carefully to it prudence perhaps you think of in the next place no she is too timid and loses opportunities in making up her mind can it be liberality then no liberality is entrusted with some small sums but she is a bad accountant and is allowed no important place in the exchequer but the treasures are given in charge to a virtue of which we hear too little in modern times as distinct from others magnanimity largeness of heart not softness or weakness of heart mind youbut capacity of heartthe great measuring virtue which weighs in heavenly balances all that may be given and all that may be gained and sees how to do noblest things in noblest ways which of two goods comprehends and therefore chooses the greatest which of two personal sacrifices dares and accepts the largest which out of the avenues of beneficence treads always that which opens farthest into the blue fields of futurity that character in fine which in those words taken by us at first for the description of a queen among the nations looks less to the present power than to the distant promise strength and honour are in her clothingand she shall rejoice in time to come     lecture ii   the heads of our subject which remain for our consideration this evening are you will remember the accumulation and the distribution of works of art our complete inquiry fell into four divisionsfirst how to get our genius then how to apply our genius then how to accumulate its results and lastly how to distribute them we considered last evening how to discover and apply itwe have tonight to examine the modes of its preservation and distribution   iii accumulationand now in the outset it will be well to face that objection which we put aside a little while ago namely that perhaps it is not well to have a great deal of good art and that it should not be made too cheap  nay i can imagine some of the more generous among you exclaiming we will not trouble you to disprove that objection of course it is a selfish and base one good art as well as other good things ought to be made as cheap as possible and put as far as we can within the reach of everybody  pardon me i am not prepared to admit that i rather side with the selfish objectors and believe that art ought not to be made cheap beyond a certain point for the amount of pleasure that you can receive from any great work depends wholly on the quantity of attention and energy of mind you can bring to bear upon it now that attention and energy depend much more on the freshness of the thing than you would at all suppose unless you very carefully studied the movements of your own minds if you see things of the same kind and of equal value very frequently your reverence for them is infallibly diminished your powers of attention get gradually wearied and your interest and enthusiasm worn out and you cannot in that state bring to any given work the energy necessary to enjoy it if indeed the question were only between enjoying a great many pictures each a little or one picture very much the sum of enjoyment being in each case the same you might rationally desire to possess rather the larger quantity than the small both because one work of art always in some sort illustrates another and because quantity diminishes the chances of destruction but the question is not a merely arithmetical one of this kind your fragments of broken admirations will not when they are put together make up one whole admiration two and two in this case do not make four nor anything like four your good picture or book or work of art of any kind is always in some degree fenced and closed about with difficulty you may think of it as of a kind of cocoanut with very often rather an unseemly shell but good milk and kernel inside now if you possess twenty cocoanuts and being thirsty go impatiently from one to the other giving only a single scratch with the point of your knife to the shell of each you will get no milk from all the twenty but if you leave nineteen of them alone and give twenty cuts to the shell of one you will get through it and at the milk of it and the tendency of the human mind is always to get tired before it has made its twenty cuts and to try another nut and moreover even if it has perseverance enough to crack its nuts it is sure to try to eat too many and so choke itself hence it is wisely appointed for us that few of the things we desire can be had without considerable labour and at considerable intervals of time we cannot generally get our dinner without working for it and that gives us appetite for it we cannot get our holiday without waiting for it and that gives us zest for it and we ought not to get our picture without paying for it and that gives us a mind to look at it nay i will even go so far as to say that we ought not to get books too cheaply no book i believe is ever worth half so much to its reader as one that has been coveted for a year at a bookstall and bought out of saved halfpence and perhaps a day or twos fasting thats the way to get at the cream of a book and i should say more on this matter and protest as energetically as i could against the plague of cheap literature with which we are just now afflicted but that i fear your calling me to order as being unpractical because i dont quite see my way at present to making everybody fast for their books but one may see that a thing is desirable and possible even though one may not at once know the best way to itand in my island of barataria when i get it well into order i assure you no book shall be sold for less than a pound sterling if it can be published cheaper than that the surplus shall all go into my treasury and save my subjects taxation in other directions only people really poor who cannot pay the pound shall be supplied with the books they want for nothing in a certain limited quantity i havent made up my mind about the number yet and there are several other points in the system yet unsettled when they are all determined if you will allow me i will come and give you another lecture on the political economy of literature11     11 see note 6th in addenda p 104  meantime returning to our immediate subject i say to my generous hearers who want to shower titians and turners upon us like falling leaves pictures ought not to be too cheap but in much stronger tone i would say to those who want to keep up the prices of pictorial property that pictures ought not to be too dear that is to say not as dear as they are for as matters at present stand it is wholly impossible for any man in the ordinary circumstances of english life to possess himself of a piece of great art a modern drawing of average merit or a firstclass engraving may perhaps not without some selfreproach be purchased out of his savings by a man of narrow income but a satisfactory example of firstrate artmasterhands workis wholly out of his reach and we are so accustomed to look upon this as the natural course and necessity of things that we never set ourselves in any wise to diminish the evil and yet it is an evil perfectly capable of diminution it is an evil precisely similar in kind to that which existed in the middle ages respecting good books and which everybody then i suppose thought as natural as we do now our small supply of good pictures you could not then study the work of a great historian or great poet any more than you can now study that of a great painter but at heavy cost if you wanted a book you had to get it written out for you or to write it out for yourself but printing came and the poor man may read his dante and his homer and dante and homer are none the worse for that but it is only in literature that private persons of moderate fortune can possess and study greatness they can study at home no greatness in art and the object of that accumulation which we are at present aiming at as our third object in political economy is to bring great art in some degree within the reach of the multitude and both in larger and more numerous galleries than we now possess and by distribution according to his wealth and wish in each mans home to render the influence of art somewhat correspondent in extent to that of literature here then is the subtle balance which your economist has to strike to accumulate so much art as to be able to give the whole nation a supply of it according to its need and yet to regulate its distribution so that there shall be no glut of it nor contempt  a difficult balance indeed for us to hold if it were left merely to our skill to poise but the just point between poverty and profusion has been fixed for us accurately by the wise laws of providence if you carefully watch for all the genius you can detect apply it to good service and then reverently preserve what it produces you will never have too little art and if on the other hand you never force an artist to work hurriedly for daily bread nor imperfectly because you would rather have showy works than complete ones you will never have too much do not force the multiplication of art and you will not have it too cheap do not wantonly destroy it and you will not have it too dear  but who wantonly destroys it you will ask why we all do perhaps you thought when i came to this part of our subject corresponding to that set forth in our housewifes economy by the keeping her embroidery from the moth that i was going to tell you only how to take better care of pictures how to clean them and varnish them and where to put them away safely when you went out of town ah not at all the utmost i have to ask of you is that you will not pull them to pieces and trample them under your feet what you will say when do we do such things havent we built a perfectly beautiful gallery for all the pictures we have to take care of yes you have for the pictures which are definitely sent to manchester to be taken care of but there are quantities of pictures out of manchester which it is your business and mine too to take care of no less than of these and which we are at this moment employing ourselves in pulling to pieces by deputy i will tell you what they are and where they are in a minute only first let me state one more of those main principles of political economy on which the matter hinges  i must begin a little apparently wide of the mark and ask you to reflect if there is any way in which we waste money more in england than in building fine tombs our respect for the dead when they are just dead is something wonderful and the way we show it more wonderful still we show it with black feathers and black horses we show it with black dresses and bright heraldries we show it with costly obelisks and sculptures of sorrow which spoil half of our most beautiful cathedrals we show it with frightful gratings and vaults and lids of dismal stone in the midst of the quiet grass and last and not least we show it by permitting ourselves to tell any number of lies we think amiable or credible in the epitaph this feeling is common to the poor as well as the rich and we all know how many a poor family will nearly ruin themselves to testify their respect for some member of it in his coffin whom they never much cared for when he was out of it and how often it happens that a poor old woman will starve herself to death in order that she may be respectably buried  now this being one of the most complete and special ways of wasting moneyno money being less productive of good or of any percentage whatever than that which we shake away from the ends of undertakers plumesit is of course the duty of all good economists and kind persons to prove and proclaim continually to the poor as well as the rich that respect for the dead is not really shown by laying great stones on them to tell us where they are laid but by remembering where they are laid without a stone to help us trusting them to the sacred grass and saddened flowers and still more that respect and love are shown to them not by great monuments to them which we build with our hands but by letting the monuments stand which they built with their own and this is the point now in question  observe there are two great reciprocal duties concerning industry constantly to be exchanged between the living and the dead we as we live and work are to be always thinking of those who are to come after us that what we do may be serviceable as far as we can make it so to them as well as to us then when we die it is the duty of those who come after us to accept this work of ours with thanks and remembrance not thrusting it aside or tearing it down the moment they think they have no use for it and each generation will only be happy or powerful to the pitch that it ought to be in fulfilling these two duties to the past and the future its own work will never be rightly done even for itselfnever good or noble or pleasurable to its own eyesif it does not prepare it also for the eyes of generations yet to come and its own possessions will never be enough for it and its own wisdom never enough for it unless it avails itself gratefully and tenderly of the treasures and the wisdom bequeathed to it by its ancestors  for be assured that all the best things and treasures of this world are not to be produced by each generation for itself but we are all intended not to carve our work in snow that will melt but each and all of us to be continually rolling a great white gathering snowball higher and higherlarger and largeralong the alps of human power thus the science of nations is to be accumulative from father to son each learning a little more and a little more each receiving all that was known and adding its own gain the history and poetry of nations are to be accumulative each generation treasuring the history and the songs of its ancestors adding its own history and its own songs and the art of nations is to be accumulative just as science and history are the work of living men not superseding but building itself upon the work of the past nearly every great and intellectual race of the world has produced at every period of its career an art with some peculiar and precious character about it wholly unattainable by any other race and at any other time and the intention of providence concerning that art is evidently that it should all grow together into one mighty temple the rough stones and the smooth all finding their place and rising day by day in richer and higher pinnacles to heaven  now just fancy what a position the world considered as one great workroomone great factory in the form of a globewould have been in by this time if it had in the least understood this duty or been capable of it fancy what we should have had around us now if instead of quarrelling and fighting over their work the nations had aided each other in their work or if even in their conquests instead of effacing the memorials of those they succeeded and subdued they had guarded the spoils of their victories fancy what europe would be now if the delicate statues and temples of the greeksif the broad roads and massy walls of the romansif the noble and pathetic architecture of the middle ages had not been ground to dust by mere human rage you talk of the scythe of time and the tooth of time i tell you time is scytheless and toothless it is we who gnaw like the wormwe who smite like the scythe it is ourselves who abolishourselves who consume we are the mildew and the flame and the soul of man is to its own work as the moth that frets when it cannot fly and as the hidden flame that blasts where it cannot illumine all these lost treasures of human intellect have been wholly destroyed by human industry of destruction the marble would have stood its two thousand years as well in the polished statue as in the parian cliff but we men have ground it to powder and mixed it with our own ashes the walls and the ways would have stoodit is we who have left not one stone upon another and restored its pathlessness to the desert the great cathedrals of old religion would have stoodit is we who have dashed down the carved work with axes and hammers and bid the mountaingrass bloom upon the pavement and the seawinds chaunt in the galleries  you will perhaps think all this was somehow necessary for the development of the human race i cannot stay now to dispute that though i would willingly but do you think it is still necessary for that development do you think that in this nineteenth century it is still necessary for the european nations to turn all the places where their principal arttreasures are into battlefields for that is what they are doing even while i speak the great firm of the world is managing its business at this moment just as it has done in past time imagine what would be the thriving circumstances of a manufacturer of some delicate producesuppose glass or chinain whose workshop and exhibition rooms all the workmen and clerks began fighting at least once a day first blowing off the steam and breaking all the machinery they could reach and then making fortresses of all the cupboards and attacking and defending the showtables the victorious party finally throwing everything they could get hold of out of the window by way of showing their triumph and the poor manufacturer picking up and putting away at last a cup here and a handle there a fine prosperous business that would be would it not and yet that is precisely the way the great manufacturing firm of the world carries on its business  it has so arranged its political squabbles for the last six or seven hundred years that not one of them could be fought out but in the midst of its most precious art and it so arranges them to this day for example if i were asked to lay my finger in a map of the world on the spot of the worlds surface which contained at this moment the most singular concentration of artteaching and arttreasure i should lay it on the name of the town of verona other cities indeed contain more works of carriageable art but none contain so much of the glorious local art and of the springs and sources of art which can by no means be made subjects of package or porterage nor i grieve to say of salvage verona possesses in the first place not the largest but the most perfect and intelligible roman amphitheatre that exists still unbroken in circle of step and strong in succession of vault and arch it contains minor roman monuments gateways theatres baths wrecks of temples which give the streets of its suburbs a character of antiquity unexampled elsewhere except in rome itself but it contains in the next place what rome does not containperfect examples of the great twelfthcentury lombardic architecture which was the root of all the mediæval art of italy without which no giottos no angelicos no raphaels would have been possible it contains that architecture not in rude forms but in the most perfect and loveliest types it ever attainedcontains those not in ruins nor in altered and hardly decipherable fragments but in churches perfect from porch to apse with all their carving fresh their pillars firm their joints unloosened besides these it includes examples of the great thirteenth and fourteenthcentury gothic of italy not merely perfect but elsewhere unrivalled at rome the romanat pisa the lombard architecture may be seen in greater or in equal nobleness but not at rome nor pisa nor florence nor in any city of the world is there a great mediæval gothic like the gothic of verona elsewhere it is either less pure in type or less lovely in completion only at verona may you see it in the simplicity of its youthful power and the tenderness of its accomplished beauty and verona possesses in the last place the loveliest renaissance architecture of italy not disturbed by pride nor defiled by luxury but rising in fair fulfilment of domestic service serenity of effortless grace and modesty of home seclusion its richest work given to the windows that open on the narrowest streets and most silent gardens all this she possesses in the midst of natural scenery such as assuredly exists nowhere else in the habitable globea wild alpine river foaming at her feet from whose shore the rocks rise in a great crescent dark with cypress and misty with olive illimitably from before her southern gates the tufted plains of italy sweep and fade in golden light around her north and west the alps crowd in crested troops and the winds of benacus bear to her the coolness of their snows  and this is the citysuch and possessing such things as theseat whose gates the decisive battles of italy are fought continually three days her towers trembled with the echo of the cannon of arcola heaped pebbles of the mincio divide her fields to this hour with lines of broken rampart whence the tide of war rolled back to novara and now on that crescent of her eastern cliffs whence the full moon used to rise through the bars of the cypresses in her burning summer twilights touching with soft increase of silver light the rosy marbles of her balconiesalong the ridge of that encompassing rock other circles are increasing now white and pale walled towers of cruel strength sablespotted with cannoncourses i tell you i have seen when the thunderclouds came down on those italian hills and all their crags were dipped in the dark terrible purple as if the winepress of the wrath of god had stained their mountainraimenti have seen the hail fall in italy till the forest branches stood stripped and bare as if blasted by the locust but the white hail never fell from those clouds of heaven as the black hail will fall from the clouds of hell if ever one breath of italian life stirs again in the streets of verona  sad as you will feel this to be i do not say that you can directly prevent it you cannot drive the austrians out of italy nor prevent them from building forts where they choose but i do say12 that you and i and all of us ought to be both acting and feeling with a full knowledge and understanding of these things and that without trying to excite revolutions or weaken governments we may give our own thoughts and help so as in a measure to prevent needless destruction we should do this if we only realized the thing thoroughly you drive out day by day through your own pretty suburbs and you think only of making with what money you have to spare your gateways handsomer and your carriagedrives widerand your drawingrooms more splendid having a vague notion that you are all the while patronizing and advancing art and you make no effort to conceal the fact that within a few hours journey of you there are gateways and drawingrooms which might just as well be yours as these all built already gateways built by the greatest masters of sculpture that ever struck marble drawingrooms painted by titian and veronese and you wont accept nor save these as they are but you will rather fetch the housepainter from over the way and let titian and veronese house the rats yes of course you answer we want nice houses here not houses in verona what should we do with houses in verona and i answer do precisely what you do with the most expensive part of your possessions here take pride in themonly a noble pride you know well when you examine your own hearts that the greater part of the sums you spend on possessions are spent for pride why are your carriages nicely painted and finished outside you dont see the outsides as you sit in themthe outsides are for other people to see why are your exteriors of houses so well finished your furniture so polished and costly but for other people to see you are just as comfortable yourselves writing on your old friend of a desk with the white cloudings in his leather and using the light of a window which is nothing but a hole in the brick wall and all that is desirable to be done in this matter is merely to take pride in preserving great art instead of in producing mean art pride in the possession of precious and enduring things a little way off instead of slight and perishing things near at hand you know in old english times our kings liked to have lordships and dukedoms abroad and why should not you merchant princes like to have lordships and estates abroad believe me rightly understood it would be a prouder and in the full sense of our english word more respectable thing to be lord of a palace at verona or of a cloister full of frescos at florence than to have a file of servants dressed in the finest liveries that ever tailor stitched as long as would reach from here to boltonyes and a prouder thing to send people to travel in italy who would have to say every now and then of some fair piece of art ah this was kept here for us by the good people of manchester than to bring them travelling all the way here exclaiming of your various art treasures these were brought here for us not altogether without harm by the good people of manchester ah but you say the art treasures exhibition will pay but veronese palaces wont pardon me they would pay less directly but far more richly do you suppose it is in the long run good for manchester or good for england that the continent should be in the state it is do you think the perpetual fear of revolution or the perpetual repression of thought and energy that clouds and encumbers the nations of europe is eventually profitable for us were we any the better of the course of affairs in 48 or has the stabling of the dragoon horses in the great houses of italy any distinct effect in the promotion of the cottontrade not so but every stake that you could hold in the stability of the continent and every effort that you could make to give example of english habits and principles on the continent and every kind deed that you could do in relieving distress and preventing despair on the continent would have tenfold reaction on the prosperity of england and open and urge in a thousand unforeseen directions the sluices of commerce and the springs of industry     12 the reader can hardly but remember mrs brownings beautiful         appeal for italy made on the occasion of the first great         exhibition of art in england            o magi of the east and of the west           your incense gold and myrrh are excellent           what gifts for christ then bring ye with the rest           your hands have worked well is your courage spent           in handwork only have you nothing best           which generous souls may perfect and present           and he shall thank the givers for no light           of teaching liberal nations for the poor           who sit in darkness when it is not night           no cure for

  no pity o world no tender utterance           of benediction and prayers stretched this way           for poor italia baffled by mischance           o gracious nations give some ear to me           you all go to your fair and i am one           who at the roadside of humanity           beseech your almsgods justice to be done           so prosper  i could press if i chose both these motives upon you of pride and selfinterest with more force but these are not motives which ought to be urged upon you at all the only motive that i ought to put before you is simply that it would be right to do this that the holding of property abroad and the personal efforts of englishmen to redeem the condition of foreign nations are among the most direct pieces of duty which our wealth renders incumbent upon us i do notand in all truth and deliberateness i say thisi do not know anything more ludicrous among the selfdeceptions of wellmeaning people than their notion of patriotism as requiring them to limit their efforts to the good of their own countrythe notion that charity is a geographical virtue and that what it is holy and righteous to do for people on one bank of a river it is quite improper and unnatural to do for people on the other it will be a wonderful thing some day or other for the christian world to remember that it went on thinking for two thousand years that neighbours were neighbours at jerusalem but not at jericho a wonderful thing for us english to reflect in afteryears how long it was before we could shake hands with anybody across that shallow salt wash which the very chalkdust of its two shores whitens from folkestone to ambleteuse  nor ought the motive of gratitude as well as that of mercy to be without its influence on you who have been the first to ask to see and the first to show to us the treasures which this poor lost italy has given to england remember all these things that delight you here were hershers either in fact or in teaching hers in fact

never could have painted but for venice and the energies which have given the only true life to your existing art were first stirred by voices of the dead that haunted the sacred field of pisa  well all these motives for some definite course of action on our part towards foreign countries rest upon very serious facts too serious perhaps you will think to be interfered with for we are all of us in the habit of leaving great things alone as if providence would mind them and attending ourselves only to little things which we know practically providence doesnt mind unless we do we are ready enough to give care to the growing of pines and lettuces knowing that they dont grow providentially sweet or large unless we look after them but we dont give any care to the good of italy or germany because we think that they will grow providentially happy without any of our meddling  let us leave the great things then and think of little things not of the destruction of whole provinces in war which it may not be any business of ours to prevent but of the destruction of poor little pictures in peace from which it surely would not be much out of our way to save them you know i said just now we were all of us engaged in pulling pictures to pieces by deputy and you did not believe me consider then this similitude of ourselves suppose you saw as i doubt not you often do see a prudent and kind young lady sitting at work in the corner of a quiet room knitting comforters for her cousins and that just outside in the hall you saw a cat and her kittens at play among the family pictures amusing themselves especially with the best vandykes by getting on the tops of the frames and then scrambling down the canvasses by their claws and on someones informing the young lady of these proceedings of the cat and kittens suppose she answered that it wasnt her cat but her sisters and the pictures werent hers but her uncles and she couldnt leave her work for she had to make so many pairs of comforters before dinner would you not say that the prudent and kind young lady was on the whole answerable for the additional touches of claw on the vandykes now that is precisely what we prudent and kind english are doing only on a larger scale here we sit in manchester hard at work very properly making comforters for our cousins all over the world just outside there in the hallthat beautiful marble hall of italythe cats and kittens and monkeys are at play among the pictures i assure you in the course of the fifteen years in which i have been working in those places in which the most precious remnants of european art exist a sensation whether i would or no was gradually made distinct and deep in my mind that i was living and working in the midst of a den of monkeyssometimes amiable and affectionate monkeys with all manner of winning ways and kind intentionsmore frequently selfish and malicious monkeys but whatever their disposition squabbling continually about nuts and the best places on the barren sticks of trees and that all this monkeys den was filled by mischance with precious pictures and the witty and wilful beasts were always wrapping themselves up and going to sleep in pictures or tearing holes in them to grin through or tasting them and spitting them out again or twisting them up into ropes and making swings of them and that sometimes only by watching ones opportunity and bearing a scratch or a bite one could rescue the corner of a tintoret or paul veronese and push it through the bars into a place of safety literally i assure you this was and this is the fixed impression on my mind of the state of matters in italy and see how the professors of art in italy having long followed a method of study peculiar to themselves have at last arrived at a form of art peculiar to themselves very different from that which was arrived at by correggio and titian naturally the professors like their own form the best and as the old pictures are generally not so startling to the eye as the modern ones the dukes and counts who possess them and who like to see their galleries look new and fine and are persuaded also that a celebrated chefdoeuvre ought always to catch the eye at a quarter of a mile off believe the professors who tell them their sober pictures are quite faded and good for nothing and should all be brought bright again and accordingly give the sober pictures to the professors to be put right by rules of art then the professors repaint the old pictures in all the principal places leaving perhaps only a bit of background to set off their own work and thus the professors come to be generally figured in my mind as the monkeys who tear holes in the pictures to grin through then the picturedealers who live by the pictures cannot sell them to the english in their old and pure state all the good work must be covered with new paint and varnished so as to look like one of the professorial pictures in the great gallery before it is saleable and thus the dealers come to be imaged in my mind as the monkeys who make ropes of the pictures to swing by then every now and then in some old stable or winecellar or timbershed behind some forgotten vats or faggots somebody finds a fresco of peruginos or giottos but doesnt think much of it and has no idea of having people coming into his cellar or being obliged to move his faggots and so he whitewashes the fresco and puts the faggots back again and these kind of persons therefore come generally to be imaged in my mind as the monkeys who taste the pictures and spit them out not finding them nice while finally the squabbling for nuts and apples called in italy bella libertà goes on all day long  now all this might soon be put an end to if we english who are so fond of travelling in the body would also travel a little in soul we think it a great triumph to get our packages and our persons carried at a fast pace but we never take the slightest trouble to put any pace into our perceptions we stay usually at home in thought or if we ever mentally see the world it is at the old stagecoach or waggon rate do but consider what an odd sight it would be if it were only quite clear to you how things are really going onhow here in england we are making enormous and expensive efforts to produce new art of all kinds knowing and confessing all the while that the greater part of it is bad but struggling still to produce new patterns of wallpapers and new shapes of teapots and new pictures and statues and architecture and pluming and cackling if ever a teapot or a picture has the least good in itall the while taking no thought whatever of the best possible pictures and statues and wallpatterns already in existence which require nothing but to be taken common care of and kept from damp and dust but we let the walls fall that giotto patterned and the canvasses rot that tintoret painted and the architecture be dashed to pieces that st louis built while we are furnishing our drawingrooms with prize upholstery and writing accounts of our handsome warehouses to the country papers dont think i use my words vaguely or generally i speak of literal facts giottos frescos at assisi are perishing at this moment for want of decent care tintorets pictures in san sebastian at venice are at this instant rotting piecemeal into grey rags st louiss chapel at carcassonne is at this moment lying in shattered fragments in the marketplace and here we are all cawing and crowing poor little halffledged daws as we are about the pretty sticks and wool in our own nests theres hardly a day passes when i am at home but i get a letter from some wellmeaning country clergyman deeply anxious about the state of his parish church and breaking his heart to get money together that he may hold up some wretched remnant of tudor tracery with one niche in the corner and no statuewhen all the while the mightiest piles of religious architecture and sculpture that ever the world saw are being blasted and withered away without one glance of pity or regret the country clergyman does not care for themhe has a seasick imagination that cannot cross channel what is it to him if the angels of assisi fade from its vaults or the queens and kings of chartres fall from their pedestals they are not in his parish  what you will say are we not to produce any new art nor take care of our parish churches no certainly not until you have taken proper care of the art you have got already and of the best churches out of the parish your first and proper standing is not as churchwardens and parish overseers in an english county but as members of the great christian community of europe and as members of that community in which alone observe pure and precious ancient art exists for there is none in america none in asia none in africa you conduct yourselves precisely as a manufacturer would who attended to his looms but left his warehouse without a roof the rain floods your warehouse the rats frolic in it the spiders spin in it the choughs build in it the wallplague frets and festers in it and still you keep weave weave weaving at your wretched webs and thinking you are growing rich while more is gnawed out of your warehouse in an hour than you can weave in a twelvemonth  even this similitude is not absurd enough to set us rightly forth the weaver would or might at least hope that his new woof was as stout as the old ones and that therefore in spite of rain and ravage he would have something to wrap himself in when he needed it but our webs rot as we spin the very fact that we despise the great art of the past shows that we cannot produce great art now if we could do it we should love it when we saw it doneif we really cared for it we should recognise it and keep it but we dont care for it it is not art that we want it is amusement gratification of pride present gainanything in the world but art let it rot we shall always have enough to talk about and hang over our sideboards  you will i hope finally ask me what is the outcome of all this practicable tomorrow morning by us who are sitting here these are the main practical outcomes of it in the first place dont grumble when you hear of a new picture being bought by government at a large price there are many pictures in europe now in danger of destruction which are in the true sense of the word priceless the proper price is simply that which it is necessary to give to get and to save them if you can get them for fifty pounds do if not for less than a hundred do if not for less than five thousand do if not for less than twenty thousand do never mind being imposed upon there is nothing disgraceful in being imposed upon the only disgrace is in imposing and you cant in general get anything much worth having in the way of continental art but it must be with the help or connivance of numbers of people who indeed ought to have nothing to do with the matter but who practically have and always will have everything to do with it and if you dont choose to submit to be cheated by them out of a ducat here and a zecchin there you will be cheated by them out of your picture and whether you are most imposed upon in losing that or the zecchins i think i may leave you to judge though i know there are many political economists who would rather leave a bag of gold on a garrettable than give a porter sixpence extra to carry it downstairs  that then is the first practical outcome of the matter never grumble but be glad when you hear of a new picture being bought at a large price in the long run the dearest pictures are always the best bargains and i repeat for else you might think i said it in mere hurry of talk and not deliberately there are some pictures which are without price you should stand nationally at the edge of dover cliffsshakespearesand wave blank cheques in the eyes of the nations on the other side of the sea freely offered for such and such canvasses of theirs  then the next practical outcome of it is never buy a copy of a picture under any circumstances whatever all copies are bad because no painter who is worth a straw ever will copy he will make a study of a picture he likes for his own use in his own way but he wont and cant copy whenever you buy a copy you buy so much misunderstanding of the original and encourage a dull person in following a business he is not fit for besides increasing ultimately chances of mistake and imposture and farthering as directly as money can farther the cause of ignorance in all directions you may in fact consider yourself as having purchased a certain quantity of mistakes and according to your power being engaged in disseminating them  i do not mean however that copies should never be made a certain number of dull persons should always be employed by a government in making the most accurate copies possible of all good pictures these copies though artistically valueless would be historically and documentarily valuable in the event of the destruction of the original picture the studies also made by great artists for their own use should be sought after with the greatest eagerness they are often to be bought cheap and in connection with the mechanical copies would become very precious tracings from frescos and other large works are also of great value for though a tracing is liable to just as many mistakes as a copy the mistakes in a tracing are of one kind only which may be allowed for but the mistakes of a common copyist are of all conceivable kinds finally engravings in so far as they convey certain facts about the pictures without pretending adequately to represent or give an idea of the pictures are often serviceable and valuable i cant of course enter into details in these matters just now only this main piece of advice i can safely give younever to buy copies of pictures for your private possession which pretend to give a facsimile that shall be in any wise representative of or equal to the original whenever you do so you are only lowering your taste and wasting your money and if you are generous and wise you will be ready rather to subscribe as much as you would have given for a copy of a great picture towards its purchase or the purchase of some other like it by the nation there ought to be a great national society instituted for the purchase of pictures presenting them to the various galleries in our great cities and watching there over their safety but in the meantime you can always act safely and beneficially by merely allowing your artist friends to buy pictures for you when they see good ones never buy for yourselves nor go to the foreign dealers but let any painter whom you know be entrusted when he finds a neglected old picture in an old house to try if he cannot get it for you then if you like it keep it if not send it to the hammer and you will find that you do not lose money on pictures so purchased  and the third and chief practical outcome of the matter is this general one wherever you go whatever you do act more for preservation and less for production i assure you the world is generally speaking in calamitous disorder and just because you have managed to thrust some of the lumber aside and get an available corner for yourselves you think you should do nothing but sit spinning in it all day longwhile as householders and economists your first thought and effort should be to set things more square all about you try to set the ground floors in order and get the rottenness out of your granaries then sit and spin but not till then   iv distributionand now lastly we come to the fourth great head of our inquiry the question of the wise distribution of the art we have gathered and preserved it must be evident to us at a moments thought that the way in which works of art are on the whole most useful to the nation to which they belong must be by their collection in public galleries supposing those galleries properly managed but there is one disadvantage attached necessarily to gallery exhibition namely the extent of mischief which may be done by one foolish curator as long as the pictures which form the national wealth are disposed in private collections the chance is always that the people who buy them will be just the people who are fond of them and that the sense of exchangeable value in the commodity they possess will induce them even if they do not esteem it themselves to take such care of it as will preserve its value undiminished at all events so long as works of art are scattered through the nation no universal destruction of them is possible a certain average only are lost by accidents from time to time but when they are once collected in a large public gallery if the appointment of curator becomes in any way a matter of formality or the post is so lucrative as to be disputed by placehunters let but one foolish or careless person get possession of it and perhaps you may have all your fine pictures repainted and the national property destroyed in a month that is actually the case at this moment in several great foreign galleries they are the places of execution of pictures over their doors you only want the dantesque inscription lasciate ogni speranza voi che entrate  supposing however this danger properly guarded against as it would be always by a nation which either knew the value or understood the meaning of painting13 arrangement in a public gallery is the safest as well as the most serviceable method of exhibiting pictures and it is the only mode in which their historical value can be brought out and their historical meaning made clear but great good is also to be done by encouraging the private possession of pictures partly as a means of study much more being always discovered in any work of art by a person who has it perpetually near him than by one who only sees it from time to time and also as a means of refining the habits and touching the hearts of the masses of the nation in their domestic life     13 it would be a great point gained towards the preservation         of pictures if it were made a rule that at every operation         they underwent the exact spots in which they have been         repainted should be recorded in writing  for these last purposes the most serviceable art is the living art of the time the particular tastes of the people will be best met and their particular ignorances best corrected by painters labouring in the midst of them more or less guided to the knowledge of what is wanted by the degree of sympathy with which their work is received so then generally it should be the object of government and of all patrons of art to collect as far as may be the works of dead masters in public galleries arranging them so as to illustrate the history of nations and the progress and influence of their arts and to encourage the private possession of the works of living masters and the first and best way in which to encourage such private possession is of course to keep down the prices of them as far as you can  i hope there are not a great many painters in the room if there are i entreat their patience for the next quarter of an hour if they will bear with me for so long i hope they will not finally be offended by what i am going to say  i repeat trusting to their indulgence in the interim that the first object of our national economy as respects the distribution of modern art should be steadily and rationally to limit its prices since by doing so you will produce two effects you will make the painters produce more pictures two or three instead of one if they wish to make money and you will by bringing good pictures within the reach of people of moderate income excite the general interest of the nation in them increase a thousandfold the demand for the commodity and therefore its wholesome and natural production  i know how many objections must arise in your minds at this moment to what i say but you must be aware that it is not possible for me in an hour to explain all the moral and commercial bearings of such a principle as this only believe me i do not speak lightly i think i have considered all the objections which could be rationally brought forward though i have time at present only to glance at the main one namely the idea that the high prices paid for modern pictures are either honourable or serviceable to the painter so far from this being so i believe one of the principal obstacles to the progress of modern art to be the high prices given for good modern pictures for observe first the action of this high remuneration on the artists mind if he gets on as it is called catches the eye of the public and especially of the public of the upper classes there is hardly any limit to the fortune he may acquire so that in his early years his mind is naturally led to dwell on this worldly and wealthy eminence as the main thing to be reached by his art if he finds that he is not gradually rising towards it he thinks there is something wrong in his work or if he is too proud to think that still the bribe of wealth and honour warps him from his honest labour into efforts to attract attention and he gradually loses both his power of mind and his rectitude of purpose this according to the degree of avarice or ambition which exists in any painters mind is the necessary influence upon him of the hope of great wealth and reputation but the harm is still greater in so far as the possibility of attaining fortune of this kind tempts people continually to become painters who have no real gift for the work and on whom these motives of mere worldly interest have exclusive influencemen who torment and abuse the patient workers eclipse or thrust aside all delicate and good pictures by their own gaudy and coarse ones corrupt the taste of the public and do the greatest amount of mischief to the schools of art in their day which it is possible for their capacities to effect and it is quite wonderful how much mischief may be done even by small capacity if you could by any means succeed in keeping the prices of pictures down you would throw all these disturbers out of the way at once  you may perhaps think that this severe treatment would do more harm than good by withdrawing the wholesome element of emulation and giving no stimulus to exertion but i am sorry to say that artists will always be sufficiently jealous of one another whether you pay them large or low prices and as for stimulus to exertion believe me no good work in this world was ever done for money nor while the slightest thought of money affected the painters mind whatever idea of pecuniary value enters into his thoughts as he works will in proportion to the distinctness of its presence shorten his power a real painter will work for you exquisitely if you give him as i told you a little while ago bread and water and salt and a bad painter will work badly and hastily though you give him a palace to live in and a princedom to live upon turner got in his earlier years halfacrown a day and his supper not bad pay neither and he learned to paint upon that and i believe that there is no chance of arts truly flourishing in any country until you make it a simple and plain business providing its masters with an easy competence but rarely with anything more and i say this not because i despise the great painter but because i honour him and i should no more think of adding to his respectability or happiness by giving him riches than if shakespeare or milton were alive i should think we added to their respectability or were likely to get better work from them by making them millionaires  but observe it is not only the painter himself whom you injure by giving him too high prices you injure all the inferior painters of the day if they are modest they will be discouraged and depressed by the feeling that their doings are worth so little comparatively in your eyesif proud all their worst passions will be aroused and the insult or opprobrium which they will try to cast on their successful rival will not only afflict and wound him but at last sour and harden him he cannot pass through such a trial without grievous harm  that then is the effect you produce on the painter of mark and on the inferior ones of his own standing but you do worse than this you deprive yourselves by what you give for the fashionable picture of the power of helping the younger men who are coming forward be it admitted for arguments sake if you are not convinced by what i have said that you do no harm to the great man by paying him well yet certainly you do him no special good his reputation is established and his fortune made he does not care whether you buy or not he thinks he is rather doing you a favour than otherwise by letting you have one of his pictures at all all the good you do him is to help him to buy a new pair of carriage horses whereas with that same sum which thus you cast away you might have relieved the hearts and preserved the health of twenty young painters and if among those twenty you but chanced on one in whom a true latent power had been hindered by his poverty just consider what a farbranching farembracing good you have wrought with that lucky expenditure of yours i say consider it in vain you cannot consider it for you cannot conceive the sickness of heart with which a young painter of deep feeling toils through his first obscurityhis sense of the strong voice within him which you will not hearhis vain fond wondering witness to the things you will not seehis far away perception of things that he could accomplish if he had but peace and time all unapproachable and vanishing from him because no one will leave him peace or grant him time all his friends falling back from him those whom he would most reverently obey rebuking and paralysing him and last and worst of all those who believe in him the most faithfully suffering by him the most bitterlythe wifes eyes in their sweet ambition shining brighter as the cheek wastes away and the little lips at his side parched and pale which one day he knows though he may never see it will quiver so proudly when they name his name calling him our father you deprive yourselves by your large expenditure for pictures of mark of the power of relieving and redeeming this distress you injure the painter whom you pay so largelyand what after all have you done for yourselves or got for yourselves it does not in the least follow that the hurried work of a fashionable painter will contain more for your money than the quiet work of some unknown man in all probability you will find if you rashly purchase what is popular at a high price that you have got one picture you dont care for for a sum which would have bought twenty you would have delighted in for remember always that the price of a picture by a living artist never represents never can represent the quantity of labour or value in it its price represents for the most part the degree of desire which the rich people of the country have to possess it once get the wealthy classes to imagine that the possession of pictures by a given artist adds to their gentility and there is no price which his work may not immediately reach and for years maintain and in buying at that price you are not getting value for your money but merely disputing for victory in a contest of ostentation and it is hardly possible to spend your money in a worse or more wasteful way for though you may not be doing it for ostentation yourself you are by your pertinacity nourishing the ostentation of others you meet them in their game of wealth and continue it for them if they had not found an opposite player the game would have been done for a proud man can find no enjoyment in possessing himself of what nobody disputes with him so that by every farthing you give for a picture beyond its fair pricethat is to say the price which will pay the painter for his timeyou are not only cheating yourself and buying vanity but you are stimulating the vanity of others paying literally for the cultivation of pride you may consider every pound that you spend above the just price of a work of art as an investment in a cargo of mental quicklime or guano which being laid on the fields of human nature is to grow a harvest of pride you are in fact ploughing and harrowing in a most valuable part of your land in order to reap the whirlwind you are setting your hand stoutly to jobs agriculture let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley  well but you will say there is one advantage in high prices which more than counterbalances all this mischief namely that by great reward we both urge and enable a painter to produce rather one perfect picture than many inferior ones and one perfect picture so you tell us and we believe it is worth a great number of inferior ones  it is so but you cannot get it by paying for it a great work is only done when the painter gets into the humour for it likes his subject and determines to paint it as well as he can whether he is paid for it or not but bad work and generally the worst sort of bad work is done when he is trying to produce a showy picture or one that shall appear to have as much labour in it as shall be worth a high price14     14 when this lecture was delivered i gave here some data for         approximate estimates of the average value of good modern         pictures of different classes but the subject is too         complicated to be adequately treated in writing without         introducing more detail than the reader will have patience         for but i may state roughly that prices above a hundred         guineas are in general extravagant for watercolours and         above five hundred for oils an artist almost always does         wrong who puts more work than these prices will remunerate         him for into any single canvasshis talent would be better         employed in painting two pictures than one so elaborate the         watercolour painters also are getting into the habit of         making their drawings too large and in a measure attaching         their price rather to breadth and extent of touch than to         thoughtful labour of course marked exceptions occur here         and there as in the case of john lewis whose drawings are         wrought with unfailing precision throughout whatever their         scale hardly any price can be remunerative for such work  there is however another point and a still more important one bearing on this matter of purchase than the keeping down of prices to a rational standard and that is that you pay your prices into the hands of living men and do not pour them into coffins  for observe that as we arrange our payment of pictures at present no artists work is worth half its proper value while he is alive the moment he dies his pictures if they are good reach double their former value but that rise of price represents simply a profit made by the intelligent dealer or purchaser on his past purchases so that the real facts of the matter are that the british public spending a certain sum annually in art determines that of every thousand it pays only five hundred shall go to the painter or shall be at all concerned in the production of art and that the other five hundred shall be paid merely as a testimonial to the intelligent dealer who knew what to buy now testimonials are very pretty and proper things within due limits but testimonial to the amount of a hundred per cent on the total expenditure is not good political economy do not therefore in general unless you see it to be necessary for its preservation buy the picture of a dead artist if you fear that it may be exposed to contempt or neglect buy it its price will then probably not be high if you want to put it into a public gallery buy it you are sure then that you do not spend your money selfishly or if you loved the mans work while he was alive and bought it then buy it also now if you can see no living work equal to it but if you did not buy it while the man was living never buy it after he is dead you are then doing no good to him and you are doing some shame to yourself look around you for pictures that you really like and in buying which you can help some genius yet unperishedthat is the best atonement you can make to the one you have neglectedand give to the living and struggling painter at once wages and testimonial  so far then of the motives which should induce us to keep down the prices of modern art and thus render it as a private possession attainable by greater numbers of people than at present but we should strive to render it accessible to them in other ways alsochiefly by the permanent decoration of public buildings and it is in this field that i think we may look for the profitable means of providing that constant employment for young painters of which we were speaking last evening  the first and most important kind of public buildings which we are always sure to want are schools and i would ask you to consider very carefully whether we may not wisely introduce some great changes in the way of school decoration hitherto as far as i know it has either been so difficult to give all the education we wanted to our lads that we have been obliged to do it if at all with cheap furniture in bare walls or else we have considered that cheap furniture and bare walls are a proper part of the means of education and supposed that boys learned best when they sat on hard forms and had nothing but blank plaster about and above them whereupon to employ their spare attention also that it was as well they should be accustomed to rough and ugly conditions of things partly by way of preparing them for the hardships of life and partly that there might be the least possible damage done to floors and forms in the event of their becoming during the masters absence the fields or instruments of battle all this is so far well and necessary as it relates to the training of country lads and the first training of boys in general but there certainly comes a period in the life of a well educated youth in which one of the principal elements of his education is or ought to be to give him refinement of habits and not only to teach him the strong exercises of which his frame is capable but also to increase his bodily sensibility and refinement and show him such small matters as the way of handling things properly and treating them considerately not only so but i believe the notion of fixing the attention by keeping the room empty is a wholly mistaken one i think it is just in the emptiest room that the mind wanders most for it gets restless like a bird for want of a perch and casts about for any possible means of getting out and away and even if it be fixed by an effort on the business in hand that business becomes itself repulsive more than it need be by the vileness of its associations and many a study appears dull or painful to a boy when it is pursued on a blotted deal desk under a wall with nothing on it but scratches and pegs which would have been pursued pleasantly enough in a curtained corner of his fathers library or at the lattice window of his cottage nay my own belief is that the best study of all is the most beautiful and that a quiet glade of forest or the nook of a lake shore are worth all the schoolrooms in christendom when once you are past the multiplication table but be that as it may there is no question at all but that a time ought to come in the life of a well trained youth when he can sit at a writing table without wanting to throw the inkstand at his neighbour and when also he will feel more capable of certain efforts of mind with beautiful and refined forms about him than with ugly ones when that time comes he ought to be advanced into the decorated schools and this advance ought to be one of the important and honourable epochs of his life  i have not time however to insist on the mere serviceableness to our youth of refined architectural decoration as such for i want you to consider the probable influence of the particular kind of decoration which i wish you to get for them namely historical painting you know we have hitherto been in the habit of conveying all our historical knowledge such as it is by the ear only never by the eye all our notions of things being ostensibly derived from verbal description not from sight now i have no doubt that as we grow gradually wiserand we are doing so every daywe shall discover at last that the eye is a nobler organ than the ear and that through the eye we must in reality obtain or put into form nearly all the useful information we are to have about this world even as the matter stands you will find that the knowledge which a boy is supposed to receive from verbal description is only available to him so far as in any underhand way he gets a sight of the thing you are talking about i remember well that for many years of my life the only notion i had of the look of a greek knight was complicated between recollection of a small engraving in my pocket popes homer and reverent study of the horse guards and though i believe that most boys collect their ideas from more varied sources and arrange them more carefully than i did still whatever sources they seek must always be ocular if they are clever boys they will go and look at the greek vases and sculptures in the british museum and at the weapons in our armouriesthey will see what real armour is like in lustre and what greek armour was like in form and so put a fairly true image together but still not in ordinary cases a very living or interesting one now the use of your decorative painting would be in myriads of ways to animate their history for them and to put the living aspect of past things before their eyes as faithfully as intelligent invention can so that the master shall have nothing to do but once to point to the schoolroom walls and for ever afterwards the meaning of any word would be fixed in a boys mind in the best possible way is it a question of classical dresswhat a tunic was like or a chlamys or a peplus at this day you have to point to some vile woodcut in the middle of a dictionary page representing the thing hung upon a stick but then you would point to a hundred figures wearing the actual dress in its fiery colours in all actions of various stateliness or strength you would understand at once how it fell round the peoples limbs as they stood how it drifted from their shoulders as they went how it veiled their faces as they wept how it covered their heads in the day of battle now if you want to see what a weapon is like you refer in like manner to a numbered page in which there are spearheads in rows and swordhilts in symmetrical groups and gradually the boy gets a dim mathematical notion how one scymitar is hooked to the right and another to the left and one javelin has a knob to it and another none while one glance at your good picture would show himand the first rainy afternoon in the schoolroom would for ever fix in his mindthe look of the sword and spear as they fell or flew and how they pierced or bent or shatteredhow men wielded them and how men died by them but far more than all this is it a question not of clothes or weapons but of men how can we sufficiently estimate the effect on the mind of a noble youth at the time when the world opens to him of having faithful and touching representations put before him of the acts and presences of great menhow many a resolution which would alter and exalt the whole course of his afterlife might be formed when in some dreamy twilight he met through his own tears the fixed eyes of those shadows of the great dead unescapable and calm piercing to his soul or fancied that their lips moved in dread reproof or soundless exhortation and if but for one out of many this were trueif yet in a few you could be sure that such influence had indeed changed their thoughts and destinies and turned the eager and reckless youth who would have cast away his energies on the racehorse or the gamblingtable to that noble liferace that holy lifehazard which should win all glory to himself and all good to his countrywould not that to some purpose be political economy of art  and observe there could be no monotony no exhaustibleness in the scenes required to be thus pourtrayed even if there were and you wanted for every school in the kingdom one death of leonidas one battle of marathon one death of cleobis and bito there need not therefore be more monotony in your art than there was in the repetition of a given cycle of subjects by the religious painters of italy but we ought not to admit a cycle at all for though we had as many great schools as we have great cities one day i hope we shall have centuries of painting would not exhaust in all the number of them the noble and pathetic subjects which might be chosen from the history of even one noble nation but besides this you will not in a little while limit your youths studies to so narrow fields as you do now there will come a timei am sure of itwhen it will be found that the same practical results both in mental discipline and in political philosophy are to be attained by the accurate study of mediæval and modern as of ancient history and that the facts of mediæval and modern history are on the whole the most important to us and among these noble groups of constellated schools which i foresee arising in our england i foresee also that there will be divided fields of thought and that while each will give its scholars a great general idea of the worlds history such as all men should possesseach will also take upon itself as its own special duty the closer study of the course of events in some given place or time it will review the rest of history but it will exhaust its own special field of it and found its moral and political teaching on the most perfect possible analysis of the results of human conduct in one place and at one epoch and then the galleries of that school will be painted with the historical scenes belonging to the age which it has chosen for its special study  so far then of art as you may apply it to that great series of public buildings which you devote to the education of youth the next large class of public buildings in which we should introduce it is one which i think a few years more of national progress will render more serviceable to us than they have been lately i mean buildings for the meetings of guilds of trades  and here for the last time i must again interrupt the course of our chief inquiry in order to state one other principle of political economy which is perfectly simple and indisputable but which nevertheless we continually get into commercial embarrassments for want of understanding and not only so but suffer much hindrance in our commercial discoveries because many of our business men do not practically admit it  supposing half a dozen or a dozen men were cast ashore from a wreck on an uninhabited island and left to their own resources one of course according to his capacity would be set to one business and one to another the strongest to dig and to cut wood and to build huts for the rest the most dexterous to make shoes out of bark and coats out of skins the best educated to look for iron or lead in the rocks and to plan the channels for the irrigation of the fields but though their labours were thus naturally severed that small group of shipwrecked men would understand well enough that the speediest progress was to be made by helping each othernot by opposing each other and they would know that this help could only be properly given so long as they were frank and open in their relations and the difficulties which each lay under properly explained to the rest so that any appearance of secresy or separateness in the actions of any of them would instantly and justly be looked upon with suspicion by the rest as the sign of some selfish or foolish proceeding on the part of the individual if for instance the scientific man were found to have gone out at night unknown to the rest to alter the sluices the others would think and in all probability rightly think that he wanted to get the best supply of water to his own field and if the shoemaker refused to show them where the bark grew which he made the sandals of they would naturally think and in all probability rightly think that he didnt want them to see how much there was of it and that he meant to ask from them more corn and potatoes in exchange for his sandals than the trouble of making them deserved and thus although each man would have a portion of time to himself in which he was allowed to do what he chose without let or inquiryso long as he was working in that particular business which he had undertaken for the common benefit any secresy on his part would be immediately supposed to mean mischief and would require to be accounted for or put an end to and this all the more because whatever the work might be certainly there would be difficulties about it which when once they were well explained might be more or less done away with by the help of the rest so that assuredly every one of them would advance with his labour not only more happily but more profitably and quickly by having no secrets and by frankly bestowing and frankly receiving such help as lay in his way to get or to give  and just as the best and richest result of wealth and happiness to the whole of them would follow on their perseverance in such a system of frank communication and of helpful labourso precisely the worst and poorest result would be obtained by a system of secresy and of enmity and each mans happiness and wealth would assuredly be diminished in proportion to the degree in which jealousy and concealment became their social and economical principles it would not in the long run bring good but only evil to the man of science if instead of telling openly where he had found good iron he carefully concealed every new bed of it that he might ask in exchange for the rare ploughshare more corn from the farmer or in exchange for the rude needle more labour from the sempstress and it would not ultimately bring good but only evil to the farmers if they sought to burn each others cornstacks that they might raise the value of their grain or if the sempstresses tried to break each others needles that each might get all the stitching to herself  now these laws of human action are precisely as authoritative in their application to the conduct of a million of men as to that of six or twelve all enmity jealousy opposition and secresy are wholly and in all circumstances destructive in their naturenot productive and all kindness fellowship and communicativeness are invariably productive in their operationnot destructive and the evil principles of opposition and exclusiveness are not rendered less fatal but more fatal by their acceptance among large masses of men more fatal i say exactly in proportion as their influence is more secret for though the opposition does always its own simple necessary direct quantity of harm and withdraws always its own simple necessary measurable quantity of wealth from the sum possessed by the community yet in proportion to the size of the community it does another and more refined mischief than this by concealing its own fatality under aspects of mercantile complication and expediency and giving rise to multitudes of false theories based on a mean belief in narrow and immediate appearances of good done here and there by things which have the universal and everlasting nature of evil so that the time and powers of the nation are wasted not only in wretched struggling against each other but in vain complaints and groundless discouragements and empty investigations and useless experiments in laws and elections and inventions with hope always to pull wisdom through some newshaped slit in a ballotbox and to drag prosperity down out of the clouds along some new knot of electric wire while all the while wisdom stands calling at the corners of the streets and the blessing of heaven waits ready to rain down upon us deeper than the rivers and broader than the dew if only we will obey the first plain principles of humanity and the first plain precepts of the skies execute true judgment and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart15     15 it would be well if instead of preaching continually about         the doctrine of faith and good works our clergymen would         simply explain to their people a little what good works         mean there is not a chapter in all the book we profess to         believe more specially and directly written for england         than the second of habakkuk and i never in all my life         heard one of its practical texts preached from i suppose         the clergymen are all afraid and know that their flocks         while they will sit quite politely to hear syllogisms out of         the epistle to the romans would get restive directly if         they ever pressed a practical text home to them but we         should have no mercantile catastrophes and no distressful         pauperism if we only read often and took to heart those         plain wordsyea also because he is a proud man neither         keepeth at home who enlargeth his desire as hell and         cannot be satisfiedshall not all these take up a parable         against him and a taunting proverb against him and say         woe to him that increaseth that which is not his and to         him that ladeth himself with thick clay what a         glorious history in one metaphor of the life of a man         greedy of fortune woe to him that coveteth an evil         covetousness that he may set his nest on high woe to him         that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a city by         iniquity behold is it not of the lord of hosts that the         people shall labour in the very fire and the people shall         weary themselves for very vanity          the americans who have been sending out ships with sham         boltheads on their timbers and only half their bolts may         meditate on that buildeth a town with blood  therefore i believe most firmly that as the laws of national prosperity get familiar to us we shall more and more cast our toil into social and communicative systems and that one of the first means of our doing so will be the reestablishing guilds of every important trade in a vital not formal conditionthat there will be a great council or government house for the members of every trade built in whatever town of the kingdom occupies itself principally in such trade with minor council halls in other cities and to each councilhall officers attached whose first business may be to examine into the circumstances of every operative in that trade who chooses to report himself to them when out of work and to set him to work if he is indeed able and willing at a fixed rate of wages determined at regular periods in the councilmeetings and whose next duty may be to bring reports before the council of all improvements made in the business and means of its extension not allowing private patents of any kind but making all improvements available to every member of the guild only allotting after successful trial of them a certain reward to the inventors  for these and many other such purposes such halls will be again i trust fully established and then in the paintings and decorations of them especial effort ought to be made to express the worthiness and honourableness of the trade for whose members they are founded for i believe one of the worst symptoms of modern society to be its notion of great inferiority and ungentlemanliness as necessarily belonging to the character of a tradesman i believe tradesmen may be ought to beoften are more gentlemen than idle and useless people and i believe that art may do noble work by recording in the hall of each trade the services which men belonging to that trade have done for their country both preserving the portraits and recording the important incidents in the lives of those who have made great advances in commerce and civilization i cannot follow out this subject it branches too far and in too many directions besides i have no doubt you will at once see and accept the truth of the main principle and be able to think it out for yourselves i would fain also have said something of what might be done in the same manner for almshouses and hospitals and for what as i shall try to explain in notes to this lecture we may hope to see some day established with a different meaning in their name than that they now bearworkhouses but i have detained you too long already and cannot permit myself to trespass further on your patience except only to recapitulate in closing the simple principles respecting wealth which we have gathered during the course of our inquiry principles which are nothing more than the literal and practical acceptance of the saying which is in all good mens mouths namely that they are stewards or ministers of whatever talents are entrusted to them only is it not a strange thing that while we more or less accept the meaning of that saying so long as it is considered metaphorical we never accept its meaning in its own terms you know the lesson is given us under the form of a story about money money was given to the servants to make use of the unprofitable servant dug in the earth and hid his lords money well we in our poetical and spiritual application of this say that of course money doesnt mean money it means wit it means intellect it means influence in high quarters it means everything in the world except itself and do not you see what a pretty and pleasant comeoff there is for most of us in this spiritual application of course if we had wit we would use it for the good of our fellowcreatures but we havent wit of course if we had influence with the bishops we would use it for the good of the church but we havent any influence with the bishops of course if we had political power we would use it for the good of the nation but we have no political power we have no talents entrusted to us of any sort or kind it is true we have a little money but the parable cant possibly mean anything so vulgar as money our moneys our own  i believe if you think seriously of this matter you will feel that the first and most literal application is just as necessary a one as any otherthat the story does very specially mean what it saysplain money and that the reason we dont at once believe it does so is a sort of tacit idea that while thought wit and intellect and all power of birth and position are indeed given to us and therefore to be laid out for the giverour wealth has not been given to us but we have worked for it and have a right to spend it as we choose i think you will find that is the real substance of our understanding in this matter beauty we say is given by godit is a talent strength is given by godit is a talent position is given by godit is a talent but money is proper wages for our days workit is not a talent it is a due we may justly spend it on ourselves if we have worked for it  and there would be some shadow of excuse for this were it not that the very power of making the money is itself only one of the applications of that intellect or strength which we confess to be talents why is one man richer than another because he is more industrious more persevering and more sagacious well who made him more persevering or more sagacious than others that power of endurance that quickness of apprehension that calmness of judgment which enable him to seize the opportunities that others lose and persist in the lines of conduct in which others failare these not talentsare they not in the present state of the world among the most distinguished and influential of mental gifts and is it not wonderful that while we should be utterly ashamed to use a superiority of body in order to thrust our weaker companions aside from some place of advantage we unhesitatingly use our superiorities of mind to thrust them back from whatever good that strength of mind can attain you would be indignant if you saw a strong man walk into a theatre or a lectureroom and calmly choosing the best place take his feeble neighbour by the shoulder and turn him out of it into the back seats or the street you would be equally indignant if you saw a stout fellow thrust himself up to a table where some hungry children were being fed and reach his arm over their heads and take their bread from them but you are not the least indignant if when a man has stoutness of thought and swiftness of capacity and instead of being longarmed only has the much greater gift of being longheadedyou think it perfectly just that he should use his intellect to take the bread out of the mouths of all the other men in the town who are of the same trade with him or use his breadth and sweep of sight to gather some branch of the commerce of the country into one great cobweb of which he is himself to be the central spider making every thread vibrate with the points of his claws and commanding every avenue with the facets of his eyes you see no injustice in this  but there is injustice and let us trust one of which honourable men will at no very distant period disdain to be guilty in some degree however it is indeed not unjust in some degree it is necessary and intended it is assuredly just that idleness should be surpassed by energy that the widest influence should be possessed by those who are best able to wield it and that a wise man at the end of his career should be better off than a fool but for that reason is the fool to be wretched utterly crushed down and left in all the suffering which his conduct and capacity naturally inflictnot so what do you suppose fools were made for that you might tread upon them and starve them and get the better of them in every possible way by no means they were made that wise people might take care of them that is the true and plain fact concerning the relations of every strong and wise man to the world about him he has his strength given him not that he may crush the weak but that he may support and guide them in his own household he is to be the guide and the support of his children out of his household he is still to be the father that is the guide and support of the weak and the poor not merely of the meritoriously weak and the innocently poor but of the guiltily and punishably poor of the men who ought to have known betterof the poor who ought to be ashamed of themselves it is nothing to give pension and cottage to the widow who has lost her son it is nothing to give food and medicine to the workman who has broken his arm or the decrepit woman wasting in sickness but it is something to use your time and strength to war with the waywardness and thoughtlessness of mankind to keep the erring workman in your service till you have made him an unerring one and to direct your fellowmerchant to the opportunity which his dullness would have lost this is much but it is yet more when you have fully achieved the superiority which is due to you and acquired the wealth which is the fitting reward of your sagacity if you solemnly accept the responsibility of it as it is the helm and guide of labour far and near for you who have it in your hands are in reality the pilots of the power and effort of the state16 it is entrusted to you as an authority to be used for good or evil just as completely as kingly authority was ever given to a prince or military command to a captain and according to the quantity of it that you have in your hands you are the arbiters of the will and work of england and the whole issue whether the work of the state shall suffice for the state or not depends upon you you may stretch out your sceptre over the heads of the english labourers and say to them as they stoop to its waving subdue this obstacle that has baffled our fathers put away this plague that consumes our children water these dry places plough these desert ones carry this food to those who are in hunger carry this light to those who are in darkness carry this life to those who are in death or on the other side you may say to her labourers here am i this power is in my hand come build a mound here for me to be throned upon high and wide come make crowns for my head that men may see them shine from far away come weave tapestries for my feet that i may tread softly on the silk and purple17 come dance before me that i may be gay and sing sweetly to me that i may slumber so shall i live in joy and die in honour and better than such an honourable death it were that the day had perished wherein we were born and the night in which it was said there is a child conceived     16 see note 7th in addenda p 106     17 see note 8th in addenda p 107  i trust that in a little while there will be few of our rich men who through carelessness or covetousness thus forfeit the glorious office which is intended for their hands i said just now that wealth ill used was as the net of the spider entangling and destroying but wealth well used is as the net of the sacred fisher who gathers souls of men out of the deep a time will comei do not think even now it is far from uswhen this golden net of the worlds wealth will be spread abroad as the flaming meshes of morning cloud are over the sky bearing with them the joy of light and the dew of the morning as well as the summons to honourable and peaceful toil what less can we hope from your wealth than this rich men of england when once you feel fully how by the strength of your possessionsnot observe by the exhaustion but by the administration of them and the poweryou can direct the actscommand the energiesinform the ignoranceprolong the existence of the whole human race and how even of worldly wisdom which man employs faithfully it is true not only that her ways are pleasantness but that her paths are peace and that for all the children of men as well as for those to whom she is given length of days are in her right hand as in her left hand riches and honour     addenda   note p 19fatherly authority  this statement could not of course be heard without displeasure by a certain class of politicians and in one of the notices of these lectures given in the manchester journals at the time endeavour was made to get quit of it by referring to the divine authority as the only paternal power with respect to which men were truly styled brethren of course it is so and equally of course all human government is nothing else than the executive expression of this divine authority the moment government ceases to be the practical enforcement of divine law it is tyranny and the meaning which i attach to the words paternal government is in more extended terms simply thisthe executive fulfilment by formal human methods of the will of the father of mankind respecting his children i could not give such a definition of government as this in a popular lecture and even in written form it will necessarily suggest many objections of which i must notice and answer the most probable  only in order to avoid the recurrence of such tiresome phrases as it may be answered in the second place and it will be objected in the third place etc i will ask the readers leave to arrange the discussion in the form of simple dialogue letting o stand for objector and r for response  oyou define your paternal government to be the executive fulfilment by formal human methods of the divine will but assuredly that will cannot stand in need of aid or expression from human laws it cannot fail of its fulfilment  rin the final sense it cannot and in that sense men who are committing murder and stealing are fulfilling the will of god as much as the best and kindest people in the world but in the limited and present sense the only sense with which we have anything to do gods will concerning man is fulfilled by some men and thwarted by others and those men who either persuade or enforce the doing of it stand towards those who are rebellious against it exactly in the position of faithful children in a family who when the father is out of sight either compel or persuade the rest to do as their father would have them were he present and in so far as they are expressing and maintaining for the time the paternal authority they exercise in the exact sense in which i mean the phrase to be understood paternal government over the rest  obut if providence has left a liberty to man in many things in order to prove him why should human law abridge that liberty and take upon itself to compel what the great lawgiver does not compel  rit is confessed in the enactment of any law whatsoever that human lawgivers have a right to do this for if you have no right to abridge any of the liberty which providence has left to man you have no right to punish any one for committing murder or robbery you ought to leave them to the punishment of god and nature but if you think yourself under obligation to punish as far as human laws can the violation of the will of god by those great sins you are certainly under the same obligation to punish with proportionately less punishment the violation of his will in less sins  ono you must not attempt to punish less sins by law because you cannot properly define nor ascertain them everybody can determine whether murder has been committed or not but you cannot determine how far people have been unjust or cruel in minor matters and therefore cannot make or execute laws concerning minor matters  rif i propose to you to punish faults which cannot be defined or to execute laws which cannot be made equitable reject the laws i propose but do not generally object to the principle of law  oyes i generally object to the principle of law as applied to minor things because if you could succeed which you cannot in regulating the entire conduct of men by law in little things as well as great you would take away from human life all its probationary character and render many virtues and pleasures impossible you would reduce virtue to the movement of a machine instead of the act of a spirit  ryou have just said parenthetically and i fully and willingly admit it that it is impossible to regulate all minor matters by law is it not probable therefore that the degree in which it is possible to regulate them by it is also the degree in which it is right to regulate them by it or what other means of judgment will you employ to separate the things which ought to be formally regulated from the things which ought not you admit that great sins should be legally repressed but you say that small sins should not be legally repressed how do you distinguish between great and small sins and how do you intend to determine or do you in practice of daily life determine on what occasions you should compel people to do right and on what occasions you should leave them the option of doing wrong  oi think you cannot make any accurate or logical distinction in such matters but that common sense and instinct have in all civilized nations indicated certain crimes of great social harmfulness such as murder theft adultery slander and such like which it is proper to repress legally and that common sense and instinct indicate also the kind of crimes which it is proper for laws to let alone such as miserliness illnatured speaking and many of those commercial dishonesties which i have a notion you want your paternal government to interfere with  rpray do not alarm yourself about what my paternal government is likely to interfere with but keep to the matter in hand you say that common sense and instinct have in all civilized nations distinguished between the sins that ought to be legally dealt with and that ought not do you mean that the laws of all civilized nations are perfect  ono certainly not  ror that they are perfect at least in their discrimination of what crimes they should deal with and what crimes they should let alone  ono not exactly  rwhat do you mean then  oi mean that the general tendency is right in the laws of civilized nations and that in due course of time natural sense and instinct point out the matters they should be brought to bear upon and each question of legislation must be made a separate subject of inquiry as it presents itself you cannot fix any general principles about what should be dealt with legally and what should not  rsupposing it to be so do you think there are any points in which our english legislation is capable of amendment as it bears on commercial and economical matters in this present time  oof course i do  rwell then let us discuss these together quietly and if the points that i want amended seem to you incapable of amendment or not in need of amendment say so but dont object at starting to the mere proposition of applying law to things which have not had law applied to them before you have admitted the fitness of my expression paternal government it only has been and remains a question between us how far such government should extend perhaps you would like it only to regulate among the children the length of their lessons and perhaps i should like it also to regulate the hardness of their cricketballs but cannot you wait quietly till you know what i want it to do before quarrelling with the thing itself  ono i cannot wait quietly in fact i dont see any use in beginning such a discussion at all because i am quite sure from the first that you want to meddle with things that you have no business with and to interfere with healthy liberty of action in all sorts of ways and i know that you cant propose any laws that would be of real use18     18 if the reader is displeased with me for putting this foolish         speech into his mouth i entreat his pardon but he may be         assured that it is a speech which would be made by many         people and the substance of which would be tacitly felt by         many more at this point of the discussion i have really         tried up to this point to make the objector as intelligent         a person as it is possible for an author to imagine anybody         to be who differs with him  rif you indeed know that you would be wrong to hear me any farther but if you are only in painful doubt about me which makes you unwilling to run the risk of wasting your time i will tell you beforehand what i really do think about this same liberty of action namely that whenever we can make a perfectly equitable law about any matter or even a law securing on the whole more just conduct than unjust we ought to make that law and that there will yet on these conditions always remain a number of matters respecting which legalism and formalism are impossible enough and more than enough to exercise all human powers of individual judgment and afford all kinds of scope to individual character i think this but of course it can only be proved by separate examination of the possibilities of formal restraint in each given field of action and these two lectures are nothing more than a sketch of such a detailed examination in one field namely that of art you will find however one or two other remarks on such possibilities in the next note   note 2nd p 21right to public support  it did not appear to me desirable in the course of the spoken lecture to enter into details or offer suggestions on the questions of the regulation of labour and distribution of relief as it would have been impossible to do so without touching in many disputed or disputable points not easily handled before a general audience but i must now supply what is wanting to make my general statement clear  i believe in the first place that no christian nation has any business to see one of its members in distress without helping him though perhaps at the same time punishing him help of coursein nine cases out of tenmeaning guidance much more than gift and therefore interference with liberty when a peasant mother sees one of her careless children fall into a ditch her first proceeding is to pull him out her second to box his ears her third ordinarily to lead him carefully a little way by the hand or send him home for the rest of the day the child usually cries and very often would clearly prefer remaining in the ditch and if he understood any of the terms of politics would certainly express resentment at the interference with his individual liberty but the mother has done her duty whereas the usual call of the mother nation to any of her children under such circumstances has lately been nothing more than the foxhuntersstay still there i shall clear you and if we always could clear them their requests to be left in muddy independence might be sometimes allowed by kind people or their cries for help disdained by unkind ones but we cant clear them the whole nation is in fact bound together as men are by ropes on a glacierif one falls the rest must either lift him or drag him along with them19 as dead weight not without much increase of danger to themselves and the law of right being manifestly in this as whether manifestly or not it is always the law of prudence the only question is how this wholesome help and interference are to be administered     19 it is very curious to watch the efforts of two shopkeepers         to ruin each other neither having the least idea that his         ruined neighbour must eventually be supported at his own         expense with an increase of poor rates and that the         contest between them is not in reality which shall get         everything for himself but which shall first take upon         himself and his customers the gratuitous maintenance of the         others family  the first interference should be in education in order that men may be able to support themselves when they are grown their strength must be properly developed while they are young and the state should always see to thisnot allowing their health to be broken by too early labour nor their powers to be wasted for want of knowledge some questions connected with this matter are noticed farther on under the head trial schools one point i must notice here that i believe all youths of whatever rank ought to learn some manual trade thoroughly for it is quite wonderful how much a mans views of life are cleared by the attainment of the capacity of doing any one thing well with his hands and arms for a long time what right life there was in the upper classes of europe depended in no small degree on the necessity which each man was under of being able to fence at this day the most useful things which boys learn at public schools are i believe riding rowing and cricketing but it would be far better that members of parliament should be able to plough straight and make a horseshoe than only to feather oars neatly or point their toes prettily in stirrups then in literary and scientific teaching the great point of economy is to give the discipline of it through knowledge which will immediately bear on practical life our literary work has long been economically useless to us because too much concerned with dead languages and our scientific work will yet for some time be a good deal lost because scientific men are too fond or too vain of their systems and waste the students time in endeavouring to give him large views and make him perceive interesting connections of facts when there is not one student no nor one man in a thousand who can feel the beauty of a system or even take it clearly into his head but nearly all men can understand and most will be interested in the facts which bear on daily life botanists have discovered some wonderful connection between nettles and figs which a cowboy who will never see a ripe fig in his life need not be at all troubled about but it will be interesting to him to know what effect nettles have on hay and what taste they will give to porridge and it will give him nearly a new life if he can be got but once in a spring time to look well at the beautiful circlet of the white nettle blossom and work out with his schoolmaster the curves of its petals and the way it is set on its central mast so the principle of chemical equivalents beautiful as it is matters far less to a peasant boy and even to most sons of gentlemen than their knowing how to find whether the water is wholesome in the backkitchen cistern or whether the sevenacre field wants sand or chalk  having then directed the studies of our youth so as to make them practically serviceable men at the time of their entrance into life that entrance should always be ready for them in cases where their private circumstances present no opening there ought to be government establishments for every trade in which all youths who desired it should be received as apprentices on their leaving school and men thrown out of work received at all times at these government manufactories the discipline should be strict and the wages steady not varying at all in proportion to the demand for the article but only in proportion to the price of food the commodities produced being laid up in store to meet sudden demands and sudden fluctuations in prices preventedthat gradual and necessary fluctuation only being allowed which is properly consequent on larger or more limited supply of raw material and other natural causes when there was a visible tendency to produce a glut of any commodity that tendency should be checked by directing the youth at the government schools into other trades and the yearly surplus of commodities should be the principal means of government provision for the poor that provision should be large and not disgraceful to them at present there are very strange notions in the public mind respecting the receiving of alms most people are willing to take them in the form of a pension from government but unwilling to take them in the form of a pension from their parishes there may be some reason for this singular prejudice in the fact of the government pension being usually given as a definite acknowledgment of some service done to the countrybut the parish pension is or ought to be given precisely on the same terms a labourer serves his country with his spade just as a man in the middle ranks of life serves it with his sword pen or lancet if the service is less and therefore the wages during health less then the reward when health is broken may be less but not therefore less honourable and it ought to be quite as natural and straightforward a matter for a labourer to take his pension from his parish because he has deserved well of his parish as for a man in higher rank to take his pension from his country because he has deserved well of his country if there be any disgrace in coming to the parish because it may imply improvidence in early life much more is there disgrace in coming to the government since improvidence is far less justifiable in a highly educated than in an imperfectly educated man and far less justifiable in a high rank where extravagance must have been luxury than in a low rank where it may only have been comfort so that the real fact of the matter is that people will take alms delightedly consisting of a carriage and footmen because those do not look like alms to the people in the street but they will not take alms consisting only of bread and water and coals because everybody would understand what those meant mind i do not want any one to refuse the carriage who ought to have it but neither do i want them to refuse the coals i should indeed be sorry if any change in our views on these subjects involved the least lessening of selfdependence in the english mind but the common shrinking of men from the acceptance of public charity is not selfdependence but mere base and selfish pride it is not that they are unwilling to live at their neighbours expense but that they are unwilling to confess they do it is not dependence they wish to avoid but gratitude they will take places in which they know there is nothing to be donethey will borrow money they know they cannot repaythey will carry on a losing business with other peoples capitalthey will cheat the public in their shops or sponge on their friends at their houses but to say plainly they are poor men who need the nations help and go into an almshousethis they loftily repudiate and virtuously prefer being thieves to being paupers  i trust that these deceptive efforts of dishonest men to appear independent and the agonizing efforts of unfortunate men to remain independent may both be in some degree checked by a better administration and understanding of laws respecting the poor but the ordinances for relief and the ordinances for labour must go together otherwise distress caused by misfortune will always be confounded as it is now with distress caused by idleness unthrift and fraud it is only when the state watches and guides the middle life of men that it can without disgrace to them protect their old age acknowledging in that protection that they have done their duty or at least some portion of their duty in better days  i know well how strange fanciful or impracticable these suggestions will appear to most of the business men of this day men who conceive the proper state of the world to be simply that of a vast and disorganized mob scrambling each for what he can get trampling down its children and old men in the mire and doing what work it finds must be done with any irregular squad of labourers it can bribe or inveigle together and afterwards scatter to starvation a great deal may indeed be done in this way by a nation strongelbowed and stronghearted as we arenot easily frightened by pushing nor discouraged by falls but it is still not the right way of doing things for people who call themselves christians every so named soul of man claims from every other such soul protection and education in childhoodhelp or punishment in middle lifereward or relief if needed in old age all of these should be completely and unstintingly given and they can only be given by the organization of such a system as i have described   note 3rd p 24trial schools  it may be seriously questioned by the reader how much of painting talent we really lose on our present system20 and how much we should gain by the proposed trial schools for it might be thought that as matters stand at present we have more painters than we ought to have having so many bad ones and that all youths who had true painters genius forced their way out of obscurity     20 it will be observed that in the lecture it is assumed         that works of art are national treasures and that it is         desirable to withdraw all the hands capable of painting or         carving from other employments in order that they may         produce this kind of wealth i do not in assuming this         mean that works of art add to the monetary resources of a         nation or form part of its wealth in the vulgar sense the         result of the sale of a picture in the country itself is         merely that a certain sum of money is transferred from the         hands of b the purchaser to those of a the producer the         sum ultimately to be distributed remaining the same only a         ultimately spending it instead of b while the labour of a         has been in the meantime withdrawn from productive channels         he has painted a picture which nobody can live upon or live         in when he might have grown corn or built houses when the         sale therefore is effected in the country itself it does         not add to but diminishes the monetary resources of the         country except only so far as it may appear probable on         other grounds that a is likely to spend the sum he         receives for his picture more rationally and usefully than         b would have spent it if indeed the picture or other         work of art be sold in foreign countries either the money         or the useful products of the foreign country being imported         in exchange for it such sale adds to the monetary resources         of the selling and diminishes those of the purchasing         nation but sound political economy strange as it may at         first appear to say so has nothing whatever to do with         separations between national interests political economy         means the management of the affairs of citizens and it         either regards exclusively the administration of the affairs         of one nation or the administration of the affairs of the         world considered as one nation so when a transaction         between individuals which enriches a impoverishes b in         precisely the same degree the sound economist considers it         an unproductive transaction between the individuals and if         a trade between two nations which enriches one impoverishes         the other in the same degree the sound eoonomist considers         it an unproductive trade between the nations it is not a         general question of political economy but only a particular         question of local expediency whether an article in itself         valueless may bear a value of exchange in transactions with         some other nation the economist considers only the actual         value of the thing done or produced and if he sees a         quantity of labour spent for instance by the swiss in         producing woodwork for sale to the english he at once sets         the commercial impoverishment of the english purchaser         against the commercial enrichment of the swiss seller and         considers the whole transaction productive only so far as         the woodwork itself is a real addition to the wealth of the         world for the arrangement of the laws of a nation so as to         procure the greatest advantages to itself and leave the         smallest advantages to other nations is not a part of the         science of political economy but merely a broad application         of the science of fraud considered thus in the abstract         pictures are not an addition to the monetary wealth of the         world except in the amount of pleasure or instruction to be         got out of them day by day but there is a certain         protective effect on wealth exercised by works of high art         which must always be included in the estimate of their         value generally speaking persons who decorate their houses         with pictures will not spend so much money in papers         carpets curtains or other expensive and perishable         luxuries as they would otherwise works of good art like         books exercise a conservative effect on the rooms they are         kept in and the wall of the library or picture gallery         remains undisturbed when those of other rooms are         repapered or repanelled of course this effect is still         more definite when the picture is on the walls themselves         either on canvass stretched into fixed shapes on their         panels or in fresco involving of course the preservation         of the building from all unnecessary and capricious         alteration and generally speaking the occupation of a         large number of hands in painting or sculpture in any nation         may be considered as tending to check the disposition to         indulge in perishable luxury i do not however in my         assumption that works of art are treasures take much into         consideration this collateral monetary result i consider         them treasures merely as permanent means of pleasure and         instruction and having at other times tried to show the         several ways in which they can please and teach assume here         that they are thus useful and that it is desirable to make         as many painters as we can  this is not so it is difficult to analyse the characters of mind which cause youths to mistake their vocation and to endeavour to become artists when they have no true artists gift but the fact is that multitudes of young men do this and that by far the greater number of living artists are men who have mistaken their vocation the peculiar circumstances of modern life which exhibit art in almost every form to the sight of the youths in our great cities have a natural tendency to fill their imaginations with borrowed ideas and their minds with imperfect science the mere dislike of mechanical employments either felt to be irksome or believed to be degrading urges numbers of young men to become painters in the same temper in which they would enlist or go to sea others the sons of engravers or artists taught the business of the art by their parents and having no gift for it themselves follow it as the means of livelihood in an ignoble patience or if ambitious seek to attract regard or distance rivalry by fantastic meretricious or unprecedented applications of their mechanical skill while finally many men earnest in feeling and conscientious in principle mistake their desire to be useful for a love of art and their quickness of emotion for its capacity and pass their lives in painting moral and instructive pictures which might almost justify us in thinking nobody could be a painter but a rogue on the other hand i believe that much of the best artistical intellect is daily lost in other avocations generally the temper which would make an admirable artist is humble and observant capable of taking much interest in little things and of entertaining itself pleasantly in the dullest circumstances suppose added to these characters a steady conscientiousness which seeks to do its duty wherever it may be placed and the power denied to few artistical minds of ingenious invention in almost any practical department of human skill and it can hardly be doubted that the very humility and conscientiousness which would have perfected the painter have in many instances prevented his becoming one and that in the quiet life of our steady craftsmensagacious manufacturers and uncomplaining clerksthere may frequently be concealed more genius than ever is raised to the direction of our public works or to be the mark of our public praises  it is indeed probable that intense disposition for art will conquer the most formidable obstacles if the surrounding circumstances are such as at all to present the idea of such conquest to the mind but we have no ground for concluding that giotto would ever have been more than a shepherd if cimabue had not by chance found him drawing or that among the shepherds of the apennines there were no other giottos undiscovered by cimabue we are too much in the habit of considering happy accidents as what are called special providences and thinking that when any great work needs to be done the man who is to do it will certainly be pointed out by providence be he shepherd or seaboy and prepared for his work by all kinds of minor providences in the best possible way whereas all the analogies of gods operations in other matters prove the contrary of this we find that of thousand seeds he often brings but one to bear often not one and the one seed which he appoints to bear is allowed to bear crude or perfect fruit according to the dealings of the husbandman with it and there cannot be a doubt in the mind of any person accustomed to take broad and logical views of the worlds history that its events are ruled by providence in precisely the same manner as its harvests that the seeds of good and evil are broadcast among men just as the seeds of thistles and fruits are and that according to the force of our industry and wisdom of our husbandry the ground will bring forth to us figs or thistles so that when it seems needed that a certain work should be done for the world and no man is there to do it we have no right to say that god did not wish it to be done and therefore sent no man able to do it the probability if i wrote my own convictions i should say certainty is that he sent many men hundreds of men able to do it and that we have rejected them or crushed them by our previous folly of conduct or of institution we have rendered it impossible to distinguish or impossible to reach them and when the need for them comes and we suffer for the want of them it is not that god refuses to send us deliverers and specially appoints all our consequent sufferings but that he has sent and we have refused the deliverers and the pain is then wrought out by his eternal law as surely as famine is wrought out by eternal law for a nation which will neither plough nor sow no less are we in error in supposing as we so frequently do that if a man be found he is sure to be in all respects fitted for the work to be done as the key is to the lock and that every accident which happened in the forging him only adapted him more truly to the wards it is pitiful to hear historians beguiling themselves and their readers by tracing in the early history of great men the minor circumstances which fitted them for the work they did without ever taking notice of the other circumstances which as assuredly unfitted them for it so concluding that miraculous interposition prepared them in all points for everything and that they did all that could have been desired or hoped for from them whereas the certainty of the matter is that throughout their lives they were thwarted and corrupted by some things as certainly as they were helped and disciplined by others and that in the kindliest and most reverent view which can justly be taken of them they were but poor mistaken creatures struggling with a world more profoundly mistaken than theyassuredly sinned against or sinning in thousands of ways and bringing out at last a maimed resultnot what they might or ought to have done but all that could be done against the worlds resistance and in spite of their own sorrowful falsehood to themselves  and this being so it is the practical duty of a wise nation first to withdraw as far as may be its youth from destructive influencesthen to try its material as far as possible and to lose the use of none that is good i do not mean by withdrawing from destructive influences the keeping of youths out of trials but the keeping them out of the way of things purely and absolutely mischievous i do not mean that we should shade our green corn in all heat and shelter it in all frost but only that we should dyke out the inundation from it and drive the fowls away from it let your youth labour and suffer but do not let it starve nor steal nor blaspheme  it is not of course in my power here to enter into details of schemes of education and it will be long before the results of experiments now in progress will give data for the solution of the most difficult questions connected with the subject of which the principal one is the mode in which the chance of advancement in life is to be extended to all and yet made compatible with contentment in the pursuit of lower avocations by those whose abilities do not qualify them for the higher but the general principle of trial schools lies at the root of the matterof schools that is to say in which the knowledge offered and discipline enforced shall be all a part of a great assay of the human soul and in which the one shall be increased the other directed as the tried heart and brain will best bear and no otherwise one thing however i must say that in this trial i believe all emulation to be a false motive and all giving of prizes a false means all that you can depend upon in a boy as significative of true power likely to issue in good fruit is his will to work for the works sake not his desire to surpass his schoolfellows and the aim of the teaching you give him ought to be to prove to him and strengthen in him his own separate gift not to puff him into swollen rivalry with those who are everlastingly greater than he still less ought you to hang favours and ribands about the neck of the creature who is the greatest to make the rest envy him try to make them love him and follow him not struggle with him  there must of course be examination to ascertain and attest both progress and relative capacity but our aim should be to make the students rather look upon it as a means of ascertaining their own true positions and powers in the world than as an arena in which to carry away a present victory i have not perhaps in the course of the lecture insisted enough on the nature of relative capacity and individual character as the roots of all real value in art we are too much in the habit in these days of acting as if art worth a price in the market were a commodity which people could be generally taught to produce and as if the education of the artist not his capacity gave the sterling value to his work no impression can possibly be more absurd or false whatever people can teach each other to do they will estimate and ought to estimate only as common industry nothing will ever fetch a high price but precisely that which cannot be taught and which nobody can do but the man from whom it is purchased no state of society nor stage of knowledge ever does away with the natural preeminence of one man over another and it is that preeminence and that only which will give work high value in the market or which ought to do so it is a bad sign of the judgment and bad omen for the progress of a nation if it supposes itself to possess many artists of equal merit noble art is nothing less than the expression of a great soul and great souls are not common things if ever we confound their work with that of others it is not through liberality but through blindness   note 4th p 24public favour  there is great difficulty in making any short or general statement of the difference between great and ignoble minds in their behaviour to the public it is by no means universally the case that a mean mind as stated in the text will bend itself to what you ask of it on the contrary there is one kind of mind the meanest of all which perpetually complains of the public contemplates and proclaims itself as a genius refuses all wholesome discipline or humble office and ends in miserable and revengeful ruin also the greatest minds are marked by nothing more distinctly than an inconceivable humility and acceptance of work or instruction in any form and from any quarter they will learn from everybody and do anything that anybody asks of them so long as it involves only toil or what other men would think degradation but the point of quarrel nevertheless assuredly rises some day between the public and them respecting some matter not of humiliation but of fact your great man always at last comes to see something the public dont see this something he will assuredly persist in asserting whether with tongue or pencil to be as he sees it not as they see it and all the world in a heap on the other side will not get him to say otherwise then if the world objects to the saying he may happen to get stoned or burnt for it but that does not in the least matter to him if the world has no particular objection to the saying he may get leave to mutter it to himself till he dies and be merely taken for an idiot that also does not matter to himmutter it he will according to what he perceives to be fact and not at all according to the roaring of the walls of red sea on the right hand or left of him hence the quarrel sure at some time or other to be started between the public and him while your mean man though he will spit and scratch spiritedly at the public while it does not attend to him will bow to it for its clap in any direction and say anything when he has got its ear which he thinks will bring him another clap and thus as stated in the text he and it go on smoothly together  there are however times when the obstinacy of the mean man looks very like the obstinacy of the great one but if you look closely into the matter you will always see that the obstinacy of the first is in the pronunciation of i and of the second in the pronunciation of it   note 5th p 38invention of new wants  it would have been impossible for political economists long to have endured the error spoken of in the text21 had they not been confused by an idea in part well founded that the energies and refinements as well as the riches of civilized life arose from imaginary wants it is quite true that the savage who knows no needs but those of food shelter and sleep and after he has snared his venison and patched the rents of his hut passes the rest of his time in animal repose is in a lower state than the man who labours incessantly that he may procure for himself the luxuries of civilization and true also that the difference between one and another nation in progressive power depends in great part on vain desires but these idle motives are merely to be considered as giving exercise to the national body and mind they are not sources of wealth except so far as they give the habits of industry and acquisitiveness if a boy is clumsy and lazy we shall do good if we can persuade him to carve cherrystones and fly kites and this use of his fingers and limbs may eventually be the cause of his becoming a wealthy and happy man but we must not therefore argue that cherrystones are valuable property or that kiteflying is a profitable mode of passing time in like manner a nation always wastes its time and labour directly when it invents a new want of a frivolous kind and yet the invention of such a want may be the sign of a healthy activity and the labour undergone to satisfy the new want may lead indirectly to useful discoveries or to noble arts so that a nation is not to be discouraged in its fancies when it is either too weak or foolish to be moved to exertion by anything but fancies or has attended to its serious business first if a nation will not forge iron but likes distilling lavender by all means give it lavender to distil only do not let its economists suppose that lavender is as profitable to it as oats or that it helps poor people to live any more than the schoolboys kite provides him his dinner luxuries whether national or personal must be paid for by labour withdrawn from useful things and no nation has a right to indulge in them until all its poor are comfortably housed and fed     21 i have given the political economists too much credit in         saying this actually while these sheets are passing         through the press the blunt broad unmitigated fallacy is         enunciated formally and precisely by the common councilmen         of new york in their report on the present commercial         crisis here is their collective opinion published in the         times of november 23rd 1857another erroneous idea is         that luxurious living extravagant dressing splendid         turnouts and fine houses are the cause of distress to a         nation no more erroneous impression could exist every         extravagance that the man of 100000 or 1000000 dollars         indulges in adds to the means the support the wealth of         ten or a hundred who had little or nothing else but their         labour their intellect or their taste if a man of         1000000 dollars spends principal and interest in ten         years and finds himself beggared at the end of that time         he has actually made a hundred who have catered to his         extravagance employers or employed so much richer by the         division of his wealth he may be ruined but the nation is         better off and richer for one hundred minds and hands with         10000 dollars apiece are far more productive than one with         the whole          yes gentlemen of the common council but what has been         doing in the time of the transfer the spending of the         fortune has taken a certain number of years suppose ten         and during that time 1000000 dollars worth of work has         been done by the people who have been paid that sum for it         where is the product of that work by your own statement         wholly consumed for the man for whom it has been done is         now a beggar you have given therefore as a nation         1000000 dollars worth of work and ten years of time and         you have produced as ultimate result one beggar excellent         economy gentlemen and sure to conduce in due sequence to         the production of more than one beggar perhaps the matter         may be made clearer to you however by a more familiar         instance if a schoolboy goes out in the morning with five         shillings in his pocket and comes home at night penniless         having spent his all in tarts principal and interest are         gone and fruiterer and baker are enriched so far so good         but suppose the schoolboy instead has bought a book and a         knife principal and interest are gone and bookseller and         cutler are enriched but the schoolboy is enriched also and         may help his schoolfellows next day with knife and book         instead of lying in bed and incurring a debt to the doctor  the enervating influence of luxury and its tendencies to increase vice are points which i keep entirely out of consideration in the present essay but so far as they bear on any question discussed they merely furnish additional evidence on the side which i have taken thus in the present case i assume that the luxuries of civilized life are in possession harmless and in acquirement serviceable as a motive for exertion and even on these favourable terms we arrive at the conclusion that the nation ought not to indulge in them except under severe limitations much less ought it to indulge in them if the temptation consequent on their possession or fatality incident to their manufacture more than counterbalances the good done by the effort to obtain them   note 6th p 48economy of literature  i have been much impressed lately by one of the results of the quantity of our books namely the stern impossibility of getting anything understood that required patience to understand i observe always in the case of my own writings that if ever i state anything which has cost me any trouble to ascertain and which therefore will probably require a minute or two of reflection from the reader before it can be acceptedthat statement will not only be misunderstood but in all probability taken to mean something very nearly the reverse of what it does mean now whatever faults there may be in my modes of expression i know that the words i use will always be found by johnsons dictionary to bear first of all the sense i use them in and that the sentences whether awkwardly turned or not will by the ordinary rules of grammar bear no other interpretation than that i mean them to bear so that the misunderstanding of them must result ultimately from the mere fact that their matter sometimes requires a little patience and i see the same kind of misinterpretation put on the words of other writers whenever they require the same kind of thought  i was at first a little despondent about this but on the whole i believe it will have a good effect upon our literature for some time to come and then perhaps the public may recover its patience again for certainly it is excellent discipline for an author to feel that he must say all he has to say in the fewest possible words or his reader is sure to skip them and in the plainest possible words or his reader will certainly misunderstand them generally also a downright fact may be told in a plain way and we want downright facts at present more than any thing else and though i often hear moral people complaining of the bad effects of want of thought for my part it seems to me that one of the worst diseases to which the human creature is liable is its disease of thinking if it would only just look22 at a thing instead of thinking what it must be like or do a thing instead of thinking it cannot be done we should all get on far better    22 there can be no question however of the mischievous        tendency of the hurry of the present day in the way people        undertake this very looking i gave three years close and        incessant labour to the examination of the chronology of the        architecture of venice two long winters being wholly spent        in the drawing of details on the spot and yet i see        constantly that architects who pass three or four days in a        gondola going up and down the grand canal think that their        first impressions are just as likely to be true as my        patiently wrought conclusions mr street for instance        glances hastily at the façade of the ducal palaceso hastily        that he does not even see what its pattern is and misses the        alternation of red and black in the centres of its        squaresand yet he instantly ventures on an opinion on the        chronology of its capitals which is one of the most        complicated and difficult subjects in the whole range of        gothic archæology it may nevertheless be ascertained with        very fair probability of correctness by any person who will        give a months hard work to it but it can be ascertained no        otherwise   note 7th p 84pilots of the state  while however undoubtedly these responsibilities attach to every person possessed of wealth it is necessary both to avoid any stringency of statement respecting the benevolent modes of spending money and to admit and approve so much liberty of spending it for selfish pleasures as may distinctly make wealth a personal reward for toil and secure in the minds of all men the right of property for although without doubt the purest pleasures it can procure are not selfish it is only as a means of personal gratification that it will be desired by a large majority of workers and it would be no less false ethics than false policy to check their energy by any forms of public opinion which bore hardly against the wanton expenditure of honestly got wealth it would be hard if a man who had passed the greater part of his life at the desk or counter could not at last innocently gratify a caprice and all the best and most sacred ends of almsgiving would be at once disappointed if the idea of a moral claim took the place of affectionate gratitude in the mind of the receiver  some distinction is made by us naturally in this respect between earned and inherited wealth that which is inherited appearing to involve the most definite responsibilities especially when consisting in revenues derived from the soil the form of taxation which constitutes rental of lands places annually a certain portion of the national wealth in the hands of the nobles or other proprietors of the soil under conditions peculiarly calculated to induce them to give their best care to its efficient administration the want of instruction in even the simplest principles of commerce and economy which hitherto has disgraced our schools and universities has indeed been the cause of ruin or total inutility of life to multitudes of our men of estate but this deficiency in our public education cannot exist much longer and it appears to be highly advantageous for the state that a certain number of persons distinguished by race should be permitted to set examples of wise expenditure whether in the advancement of science or in patronage of art and literature only they must see to it that they take their right standing more firmly than they have done hitherto for the position of a rich man in relation to those around him is in our present real life and is also contemplated generally by political economists as being precisely the reverse of what it ought to be a rich man ought to be continually examining how he may spend his money for the advantage of others at present others are continually plotting how they may beguile him into spending it apparently for his own the aspect which he presents to the eyes of the world is generally that of a person holding a bag of money with a staunch grasp and resolved to part with none of it unless he is forced and all the people about him are plotting how they may force him that is to say how they may persuade him that he wants this thing or that or how they may produce things that he will covet and buy one man tries to persuade him that he wants perfumes another that he wants jewellery another that he wants sugarplums another that he wants roses at christmas anybody who can invent a new want for him is supposed to be a benefactor to society and thus the energies of the poorer people about him are continually directed to the production of covetable instead of serviceable things and the rich man has the general aspect of a fool plotted against by all the world whereas the real aspect which he ought to have is that of a person wiser than others entrusted with the management of a larger quantity of capital which he administers for the profit of all directing each man to the labour which is most healthy for him and most serviceable for the community   note 8th p 84silk and purple  in various places throughout these lectures i have had to allude to the distinction between productive and unproductive labour and between true and false wealth i shall here endeavour as clearly as i can to explain the distinction i mean  property may be divided generally into two kinds that which produces life and that which produces the objects of life that which produces or maintains life consists of food in so far as it is nourishing of furniture and clothing in so far as they are protective or cherishing of fuel and of all land instruments or materials necessary to produce food houses clothes and fuel it is specially and rightly called useful property  the property which produces the objects of life consists of all that gives pleasure or suggests and preserves thought of food furniture and land in so far as they are pleasing to the appetite or the eye of luxurious dress and all other kinds of luxuries of books pictures and architecture but the modes of connection of certain minor forms of property with human labour render it desirable to arrange them under more than these two heads property may therefore be conveniently considered as of five kinds  1st property necessary to life but not producible by labour and therefore belonging of right in a due measure to every human being as soon as he is born and morally unalienable as for instance his proper share of the atmosphere without which he cannot breathe and of water which he needs to quench his thirst as much land as he needs to feed from is also inalienable but in well regulated communities this quantity of land may often be represented by other possessions or its need supplied by wages and privileges  2 property necessary to life but only producible by labour and of which the possession is morally connected with labour so that no person capable of doing the work necessary for its production has a right to it until he has done that workhe that will not work neither should he eat it consists of simple food clothing and habitation with their seeds and materials or instruments and machinery and animals used for necessary draught or locomotion etc it is to be observed of this kind of property that its increase cannot usually be carried beyond a certain point because it depends not on labour only but on things of which the supply is limited by nature the possible accumulation of corn depends on the quantity of corngrowing land possessed or commercially accessible and that of steel similarly on the accessible quantity of coal and ironstone it follows from this natural limitation of supply that the accumulation of property of this kind in large masses at one point or in one persons hands commonly involves more or less the scarcity of it at another point and in other persons hands so that the accidents or energies which may enable one man to procure a great deal of it may and in all likelihood will partially prevent other men procuring a sufficiency of it however willing they may be to work for it therefore the modes of its accumulation and distribution need to be in some degree regulated by law and by national treaties in order to secure justice to all men  another point requiring notice respecting this sort of property is that no work can be wasted in producing it provided only the kind of it produced be preservable and distributable since for every grain of such commodities we produce we are rendering so much more life possible on earth23 but though we are sure thus that we are employing people well we cannot be sure we might not have employed them better for it is possible to direct labour to the production of life until little or none is left for that of the objects of life and thus to increase population at the expense of civilization learning and morality on the other hand it is just as possibleand the error is one to which the world is on the whole more liableto direct labour to the objects of life till too little is left for life and thus to increase luxury or learning at the expense of population right political economy holds its aim poised justly between the two extremes desiring neither to crowd its dominions with a race of savages nor to found courts and colleges in the midst of a desert     23 this point has sometimes been disputed for instance         opening mills political economy the other day i chanced         on a passage in which he says that a man who makes a coat         if the person who wears the coat does nothing useful while         he wears it has done no more good to society than the man         who has only raised a pineapple but this is a fallacy         induced by endeavour after too much subtlety none of us         have a right to say that the life of a man is of no use to         him though it may be of no use to us and the man who         made the coat and thereby prolonged another mans life has         done a gracious and useful work whatever may come of the         life so prolonged we may say to the wearer of the coat         you who are wearing coats and doing nothing in them are         at present wasting your own life and other peoples but we         have no right to say that his existence however wasted is         wasted away it may be just dragging itself on in its         thin golden line with nothing dependent upon it to the         point where it is to strengthen into good chain cable and         have thousands of other lives dependent on it meantime the         simple fact respecting the coatmaker is that he has given         so much life to the creature the results of which he cannot         calculate they may bein all probability will beinfinite         results in some way but the raiser of pines who has only         given a pleasant taste in the mouth to some one may see         with tolerable clearness to the end of the taste in the         mouth and of all conceivable results therefrom  3 the third kind of property is that which conduces to bodily pleasures and conveniences without directly tending to sustain life perhaps sometimes indirectly tending to destroy it all dainty as distinguished from nourishing food and means of producing it all scents not needed for health substances valued only for their appearance and rarity as gold and jewels flowers of difficult culture animals used for delight as horses for racing and such like form property of this class to which the term luxury or luxuries ought exclusively to belong  respecting which we have to note first that all such property is of doubtful advantage even to its possessor furniture tempting to indolence sweet odours and luscious food are more or less injurious to health while jewels liveries and other such common belongings of wealthy people certainly convey no pleasure to their owners proportionate to their cost  farther such property for the most part perishes in the using jewels form a great exceptionbut rich food fine dresses horses and carriages are consumed by the owners use it ought much oftener to be brought to the notice of rich men what sums of interest of money they are paying towards the close of their lives for luxuries consumed in the middle of them it would be very interesting for instance to know the exact sum which the money spent in london for ices at its desserts and balls during the last twenty years had it been saved and put out at compound interest would at this moment have furnished for useful purposes  also in most cases the enjoyment of such property is wholly selfish and limited to its possessor splendid dress and equipage however when so arranged as to produce real beauty of effect may often be rather a generous than a selfish channel of expenditure they will however necessarily in such case involve some of the arts of design and therefore take their place in a higher category than that of luxuries merely  4 the fourth kind of property is that which bestows intellectual or emotional pleasure consisting of land set apart for purposes of delight more than for agriculture of books works of art and objects of natural history  it is of course impossible to fix an accurate limit between property of the last class and of this class since things which are a mere luxury to one person are a means of intellectual occupation to another flowers in a london ballroom are a luxury in a botanical garden a delight of the intellect and in their native fields both while the most noble works of art are continually made material of vulgar luxury or of criminal pride but when rightly used property of this fourth class is the only kind which deserves the name of real property it is the only kind which a man can truly be said to possess what a man eats or drinks or wears so long as it is only what is needful for life can no more be thought of as his possession than the air he breathes the air is as needful to him as the food but we do not talk of a mans wealth of air and what food or clothing a man possesses more than he himself requires must be for others to use and to him therefore not a real property in itself but only a means of obtaining some real property in exchange for it whereas the things that give intellectual or emotional enjoyment may be accumulated and do not perish in using but continually supply new pleasures and new powers of giving pleasures to others and these therefore are the only things which can rightly be thought of as giving wealth or well being food conduces only to being but these to well being and there is not any broader general distinction between lower and higher orders of men than rests on their possession of this real property the human race may be properly divided by zoologists into men who have gardens libraries or works of art and who have none and the former class will include all noble persons except only a few who make the world their garden or museum while the people who have not or which is the same thing do not care for gardens or libraries but care for nothing but money or luxuries will include none but ignoble persons only it is necessary to understand that i mean by the term garden as much the carthusians plot of ground fifteen feet square between his monastery buttresses as i do the grounds of chatsworth or kew and i mean by the term art as much the old sailors print of the arethusa bearing up to engage the belle poule as i do raphaels disputa and even rather more for when abundant beautiful possessions of this kind are almost always associated with vulgar luxury and become then anything but indicative of noble character in their possessors the ideal of human life is a union of spartan simplicity of manners with athenian sensibility and imagination but in actual results we are continually mistaking ignorance for simplicity and sensuality for refinement  5 the fifth kind of property is representative property consisting of documents or money or rather documents only for money itself is only a transferable document current among societies of men giving claim at sight to some definite benefit or advantage most commonly to a certain share of real property existing in those societies the money is only genuine when the property it gives claim to is real or the advantages it gives claim to certain otherwise it is false money and may be considered as much forged when issued by a government or a bank as when by an individual thus if a dozen of men cast ashore on a desert island pick up a number of stones put a red spot on each stone and pass a law that every stone marked with a red spot shall give claim to a peck of wheatso long as no wheat exists or can exist on the island the stones are not money but the moment as much wheat exists as shall render it possible for the society always to give a peck for every spotted stone the spotted stones would become money and might be exchanged by their possessors for whatever other commodities they chose to the value of the peck of wheat which the stones represented if more stones were issued than the quantity of wheat could answer the demand of the value of the stone coinage would be depreciated in proportion to its increase above the quantity needed to answer it  again supposing a certain number of the men so cast ashore were set aside by lot or any other convention to do the rougher labour necessary for the whole society they themselves being maintained by the daily allotment of a certain quantity of food clothing etc then if it were agreed that the stones spotted with red should be signs of a government order for the labour of these men and that any person presenting a spotted stone at the office of the labourers should be entitled to a mans work for a week or a day the red stones would be money and mightprobably wouldimmediately pass current in the island for as much food or clothing or iron or any other article as a mans work for the period secured by the stone was worth but if the government issued so many spotted stones that it was impossible for the body of men they employed to comply with the orders as suppose if they only employed twelve men and issued eighteen spotted stones daily ordering a days work each then the six extra stones would be forged or false money and the effect of this forgery would be the depreciation of the value of the whole coinage by onethird that being the period of shortcoming which would on the average necessarily ensue in the execution of each order much occasional work may be done in a state or society by help of an issue of false money or false promises by way of stimulants and the fruit of this work if it comes into the promisers hands may sometimes enable the false promises at last to be fulfilled hence the frequent issue of false money by governments and banks and the not unfrequent escapes from the natural and proper consequences of such false issues so as to cause a confused conception in most peoples minds of what money really is i am not sure whether some quantity of such false issue may not really be permissible in a nation accurately proportioned to the minimum average produce of the labour it excites but all such procedures are more or less unsound and the notion of unlimited issue of currency is simply one of the absurdest and most monstrous that ever came into disjointed human wits  the use of objects of real or supposed value for currency as gold jewellery etc is barbarous and it always expresses either the measure of the distrust in the society of its own government or the proportion of distrustful or barbarous nations with whom it has to deal a metal not easily corroded or imitated is a desirable medium of currency for the sake of cleanliness and convenience but were it possible to prevent forgery the more worthless the metal itself the better the use of worthless media unrestrained by the use of valuable media has always hitherto involved and is therefore supposed to involve necessarily unlimited or at least improperly extended issue but we might as well suppose that a man must necessarily issue unlimited promises because his words cost nothing intercourse with foreign nations must indeed for ages yet to come at the worlds present rate of progress be carried on by valuable currencies but such transactions are nothing more than forms of barter the gold used at present as a currency is not in point of fact currency at all but the real property24 which the currency gives claim to stamped to measure its quantity and mingling with the real currency occasionally by barter     24 or rather equivalent to such real property because         everybody has been accustomed to look upon it as valuable         and therefore everybody is willing to give labour or goods         for it but real property does ultimately consist only in         things that nourish body or mind gold would be useless to         us if we could not get mutton or books for it ultimately         all commercial mistakes and embarrassments result from         people expecting to get goods without working for them or         wasting them after they have got them a nation which         labours and takes care of the fruits of labour would be         rich and happy though there were no gold in the universe a         nation which is idle and wastes the produce of what work it         does would be poor and miserable though all its mountains         were of gold and had glens filled with diamonds instead of         glacier  the evils necessarily resulting from the use of baseless currencies have been terribly illustrated while these sheets have been passing through the press i have not had time to examine the various conditions of dishonest or absurd trading which have led to the late panic in america and england this only i know that no merchant deserving the name ought to be more liable to panic than a soldier should for his name should never be on more paper than he can at any instant meet the call of happen what will i do not say this without feeling at the same time how difficult it is to mark in existing commerce the just limits between the spirit of enterprise and of speculation something of the same temper which makes the english soldier do always all that is possible and attempt more than is possible joins its influence with that of mere avarice in tempting the english merchant into risks which he cannot justify and efforts which he cannot sustain and the same passion for adventure which our travellers gratify every summer on perilous snow wreaths and cloudencompassed precipices surrounds with a romantic fascination the glittering of a hollow investment and gilds the clouds that curl round gulfs of ruin nay a higher and a more serious feeling frequently mingles in the motley temptation and men apply themselves to the task of growing rich as to a labour of providential appointment from which they cannot pause without culpability nor retire without dishonour our large trading cities bear to me very nearly the aspect of monastic establishments in which the roar of the millwheel and the crane takes the place of other devotional music and in which the worship of mammon or moloch is conducted with a tender reverence and an exact propriety the merchant rising to his mammon matins with the selfdenial of an anchorite and expiating the frivolities into which he may be beguiled in the course of the day by late attendance at mammon vespers but with every allowance that can be made for these conscientious and romantic persons the fact remains the same that by far the greater number of the transactions which lead to these times of commercial embarrassment may be ranged simply under two great headsgambling and stealing and both of these in their most culpable form namely gambling with money which is not ours and stealing from those who trust us i have sometimes thought a day might come when the nation would perceive that a welleducated man who steals a hundred thousand pounds involving the entire means of subsistence of a hundred families deserves on the whole as severe a punishment as an illeducated man who steals a purse from a pocket or a mug from a pantry but without hoping for this excess of clearsightedness we may at least labour for a system of greater honesty and kindness in the minor commerce of our daily life since the great dishonesty of the great buyers and sellers is nothing more than the natural growth and outcome from the little dishonesty of the little buyers and sellers every person who tries to buy an article for less than its proper value or who tries to sell it at more than its proper valueevery consumer who keeps a tradesman waiting for his money and every tradesman who bribes a consumer to extravagance by credit is helping forward according to his own measure of power a system of baseless and dishonourable commerce and forcing his country down into poverty and shame and people of moderate means and average powers of mind would do far more real good by merely carrying out stern principles of justice and honesty in common matters of trade than by the most ingenious schemes of extended philanthropy or vociferous declarations of theological doctrine there are three weighty matters of the lawjustice mercy and truth and of these the teacher puts truth last because that cannot be known but by a course of acts of justice and love but men put in all their efforts truth first because they mean by it their own opinions and thus while the world has many people who would suffer martyrdom in the cause of what they call truth it has few who will suffer even a little inconvenience in that of justice and mercy     unto this last  four essays on the first principles of political economy       friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me     for a penny take that thine is and go thy way i will give     unto this last even as unto thee      if ye think good give me my price and if not forbear so     they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver     preface   the four following essays were published eighteen months ago in the cornhill magazine and were reprobated in a violent manner as far as i could hear by most of the readers they met with  not a whit the less i believe them to be the best that is to say the truest rightestworded and most serviceable things i have ever written and the last of them having had especial pains spent on it is probably the best i shall ever write  this the reader may reply it might be yet not therefore well written which in no mock humility admitting i yet rest satisfied with the work though with nothing else that i have done and purposing shortly to follow out the subjects opened in these papers as i may find leisure i wish the introductory statements to be within the reach of any one who may care to refer to them so i republish the essays as they appeared one word only is changed correcting the estimate of a weight and no word is added  although however i find nothing to modify in these papers it is a matter of regret to me that the most startling of all the statements in themthat respecting the necessity of the organization of labour with fixed wagesshould have found its way into the first essay it being quite one of the least important though by no means the least certain of the positions to be defended the real gist of these papers their central meaning and aim is to give as i believe for the first time in plain englishit has often been incidentally given in good greek by plato and xenophon and good latin by cicero and horacea logical definition of wealth such definition being absolutely needed for a basis of economical science the most reputed essay on that subject which has appeared in modern times after opening with the statement that writers on political economy profess to teach or to investigate25 the nature of wealth thus follows up the declaration of its thesisevery one has a notion sufficiently correct for common purposes of what is meant by wealth  it is no part of the design of this treatise to aim at metaphysical nicety of definition26     25 which for where investigation is necessary teaching is         impossible     26 principles of political economy by j s mill         preliminary remarks p 2  metaphysical nicety we assuredly do not need but physical nicety and logical accuracy with respect to a physical subject we as assuredly do  suppose the subject of inquiry instead of being houselaw oikonomia had been starlaw astronomia and that ignoring distinction between stars fixed and wandering as here between wealth radiant and wealth reflective the writer had begun thus every one has a notion sufficiently correct for common purposes of what is meant by stars metaphysical nicety in the definition of a star is not the object of this treatisethe essay so opened might yet have been far more true in its final statements and a thousandfold more serviceable to the navigator than any treatise on wealth which founds its conclusions on the popular conception of wealth can ever become to the economist                                       it was therefore the first object of these following papers to give an accurate and stable definition of wealth their second object was to show that the acquisition of wealth was finally possible only under certain moral conditions of society of which quite the first was a belief in the existence and even for practical purposes in the attainability of honesty  without venturing to pronouncesince on such a matter human judgment is by no means conclusivewhat is or is not the noblest of gods works we may yet admit so much of popes assertion as that an honest man is among his best works presently visible and as things stand a somewhat rare one but not an incredible or miraculous work still less an abnormal one honesty is not a disturbing force which deranges the orbits of economy but a consistent and commanding force by obedience to whichand by no other obediencethose orbits can continue clear of chaos  it is true i have sometimes heard pope condemned for the lowness instead of the height of his standardhonesty is indeed a respectable virtue but how much higher may men attain shall nothing more be asked of us than that we be honest  for the present good friends nothing it seems that in our aspirations to be more than that we have to some extent lost sight of the propriety of being so much as that what else we may have lost faith in there shall be here no question but assuredly we have lost faith in common honesty and in the working power of it and this faith with the facts on which it may rest it is quite our first business to recover and keep not only believing but even by experience assuring ourselves that there are yet in the world men who can be restrained from fraud otherwise than by the fear of losing employment27 nay that it is even accurately in proportion to the number of such men in any state that the said state does or can prolong its existence     27 the effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman         is not that of his corporation but of his customers it is         the fear of losing their employment which restrains his         frauds and corrects his negligence wealth of nations         book i chap 10  to these two points then the following essays are mainly directed the subject of the organization of labour is only casually touched upon because if we once can get a sufficient quantity of honesty in our captains the organization of labour is easy and will develop itself without quarrel or difficulty but if we cannot get honesty in our captains the organization of labour is for evermore impossible  the several conditions of its possibility i purpose to examine at length in the sequel yet lest the reader should be alarmed by the hints thrown out during the following investigation of first principles as if they were leading him into unexpectedly dangerous ground i will for his better assurance state at once the worst of the political creed at which i wish him to arrive  1 firstthat there should be training schools for youth established at government cost28 and under government discipline over the whole country that every child born in the country should at the parents wish be permitted and in certain cases be under penalty required to pass through them and that in these schools the child should with other minor pieces of knowledge hereafter to be considered imperatively be taught with the best skill of teaching that the country could produce the following three things    a the laws of health and the exercises enjoined by them   b habits of gentleness and justice and   c the calling by which he is to live     28 it will probably be inquired by nearsighted persons out of         what funds such schools could be supported the expedient         modes of direct provision for them i will examine hereafter         indirectly they would be far more than selfsupporting the         economy in crime alone quite one of the most costly         articles of luxury in the modern european market which         such schools would induce would suffice to support them ten         times over their economy of labour would be pure gain and         that too large to be presently calculable  2 secondlythat in connection with these training schools there should be established also entirely under government regulation manufactories and workshops for the production and sale of every necessary of life and for the exercise of every useful art and that interfering no whit with private enterprise nor setting any restraints or tax on private trade but leaving both to do their best and beat the government if they couldthere should at these government manufactories and shops be authoritatively good and exemplary work done and pure and true substance sold so that a man could be sure if he chose to pay the government price that he got for his money bread that was bread ale that was ale and work that was work  3 thirdlythat any man or woman or boy or girl out of employment should be at once received at the nearest government school and set to such work as it appeared on trial they were fit for at a fixed rate of wages determinable every yearthat being found incapable of work through ignorance they should be taught or being found incapable of work through sickness should be tended but that being found objecting to work they should be set under compulsion of the strictest nature to the more painful and degrading forms of necessary toil especially to that in mines and other places of danger such danger being however diminished to the utmost by careful regulation and discipline and the due wages of such work be retainedcost of compulsion first abstractedto be at the workmans command so soon as he has come to sounder mind respecting the laws of employment  4 lastlythat for the old and destitute comfort and home should be provided which provision when misfortune had been by the working of such a system sifted from guilt would be honourable instead of disgraceful to the receiver for i repeat this passage out of my political economy of art to which the reader is referred for farther detail29 a labourer serves his country with his spade just as a man in the middle ranks of life serves it with sword pen or lancet if the service is less and therefore the wages during health less then the reward when health is broken may be less but not therefore less honourable and it ought to be quite as natural and straightforward a matter for a labourer to take his pension from his parish because he has deserved well of his parish as for a man in higher rank to take his pension from his country because he has deserved well of his country     29 the political economy of art addenda p 93  to which statement i will only add for conclusion respecting the discipline and pay of life and death that for both high and low livys last words touching valerius publicola de publico est elatus30 ought not to be a dishonourable close of epitaph     30 p valerius omnium consensu princeps belli pacisque         artibus anno post moritur gloriâ ingenti copiis         familiaribus adeo exiguis ut funeri sumtus deesset de         publico est elatus luxêre matronæ ut brutumlib ii         c xvi  these things then i believe and am about as i find power to explain and illustrate in their various bearings following out also what belongs to them of collateral inquiry here i state them only in brief to prevent the reader casting about in alarm for my ultimate meaning yet requesting him for the present to remember that in a science dealing with so subtle elements as those of human nature it is only possible to answer for the final truth of principles not for the direct success of plans and that in the best of these last what can be immediately accomplished is always questionable and what can be finally accomplished inconceivable    denmark hill 10th may 1862     essay i  the roots of honour   among the delusions which at different periods have possessed themselves of the minds of large masses of the human race perhaps the most curiouscertainly the least creditableis the modern soidisant science of political economy based on the idea that an advantageous code of social action may be determined irrespectively of the influence of social affection  of course as in the instances of alchemy astrology witchcraft and other such popular creeds political economy has a plausible idea at the root of it the social affections says the economist are accidental and disturbing elements in human nature but avarice and the desire of progress are constant elements let us eliminate the inconstants and considering the human being merely as a covetous machine examine by what laws of labour purchase and sale the greatest accumulative result in wealth is obtainable those laws once determined it will be for each individual afterwards to introduce as much of the disturbing affectionate element as he chooses and to determine for himself the result on the new conditions supposed  this would be a perfectly logical and successful method of analysis if the accidentals afterwards to be introduced were of the same nature as the powers first examined supposing a body in motion to be influenced by constant and inconstant forces it is usually the simplest way of examining its course to trace it first under the persistent conditions and afterwards introduce the causes of variation but the disturbing elements in the social problem are not of the same nature as the constant ones they alter the essence of the creature under examination the moment they are added they operate not mathematically but chemically introducing conditions which render all our previous knowledge unavailable we made learned experiments upon pure nitrogen and have convinced ourselves that it is a very manageable gas but behold the thing which we have practically to deal with is its chloride and this the moment we touch it on our established principles sends us and our apparatus through the ceiling  observe i neither impugn nor doubt the conclusions of the science if its terms are accepted i am simply uninterested in them as i should be in those of a science of gymnastics which assumed that men had no skeletons it might be shown on that supposition that it would be advantageous to roll the students up into pellets flatten them into cakes or stretch them into cables and that when these results were effected the reinsertion of the skeleton would be attended with various inconveniences to their constitution the reasoning might be admirable the conclusions true and the science deficient only in applicability modern political economy stands on a precisely similar basis assuming not that the human being has no skeleton but that it is all skeleton it founds an ossifiant theory of progress on this negation of a soul and having shown the utmost that may be made of bones and constructed a number of interesting geometrical figures with deathsheads and humeri successfully proves the inconvenience of the reappearance of a soul among these corpuscular structures i do not deny the truth of this theory i simply deny its applicability to the present phase of the world  this inapplicability has been curiously manifested during the embarrassment caused by the late strikes of our workmen here occurs one of the simplest cases in a pertinent and positive form of the first vital problem which political economy has to deal with the relation between employer and employed and at a severe crisis when lives in multitudes and wealth in masses are at stake the political economists are helplesspractically mute no demonstrable solution of the difficulty can be given by them such as may convince or calm the opposing parties obstinately the masters take one view of the matter obstinately the operatives another and no political science can set them at one  it would be strange if it could it being not by science of any kind that men were ever intended to be set at one disputant after disputant vainly strives to show that the interests of the masters are or are not antagonistic to those of the men none of the pleaders ever seeming to remember that it does not absolutely or always follow that the persons must be antagonistic because their interests are if there is only a crust of bread in the house and mother and children are starving their interests are not the same if the mother eats it the children want it if the children eat it the mother must go hungry to her work yet it does not necessarily follow that there will be antagonism between them that they will fight for the crust and that the mother being strongest will get it and eat it neither in any other case whatever the relations of the persons may be can it be assumed for certain that because their interests are diverse they must necessarily regard each other with hostility and use violence or cunning to obtain the advantage  even if this were so and it were as just as it is convenient to consider men as actuated by no other moral influences than those which affect rats or swine the logical conditions of the question are still indeterminable it can never be shown generally either that the interests of master and labourer are alike or that they are opposed for according to circumstances they may be either it is indeed always the interest of both that the work should be rightly done and a just price obtained for it but in the division of profits the gain of the one may or may not be the loss of the other it is not the masters interest to pay wages so low as to leave the men sickly and depressed nor the workmans interest to be paid high wages if the smallness of the masters profit hinders him from enlarging his business or conducting it in a safe and liberal way a stoker ought not to desire high pay if the company is too poor to keep the enginewheels in repair  and the varieties of circumstance which influence these reciprocal interests are so endless that all endeavour to deduce rules of action from balance of expediency is in vain and it is meant to be in vain for no human actions ever were intended by the maker of men to be guided by balances of expediency but by balances of justice he has therefore rendered all endeavours to determine expediency futile for evermore no man ever knew or can know what will be the ultimate result to himself or to others of any given line of conduct but every man may know and most of us do know what is a just and unjust act and all of us may know also that the consequences of justice will be ultimately the best possible both to others and ourselves though we can neither say what is best or how it is likely to come to pass  i have said balances of justice meaning in the term justice to include affectionsuch affection as one man owes to another all right relations between master and operative and all their best interests ultimately depend on these  we shall find the best and simplest illustration of the relations of master and operative in the position of domestic servants  we will suppose that the master of a household desires only to get as much work out of his servants as he can at the rate of wages he gives he never allows them to be idle feeds them as poorly and lodges them as ill as they will endure and in all things pushes his requirements to the exact point beyond which he cannot go without forcing the servant to leave him in doing this there is no violation on his part of what is commonly called justice he agrees with the domestic for his whole time and service and takes themthe limits of hardship in treatment being fixed by the practice of other masters in his neighbourhood that is to say by the current rate of wages for domestic labour if the servant can get a better place he is free to take one and the master can only tell what is the real market value of his labour by requiring as much as he will give  this is the politicoeconomical view of the case according to the doctors of that science who assert that by this procedure the greatest average of work will be obtained from the servant and therefore the greatest benefit to the community and through the community by reversion to the servant himself  that however is not so it would be so if the servant were an engine of which the motive power was steam magnetism gravitation or any other agent of calculable force but he being on the contrary an engine whose motive power is a soul the force of this very peculiar agent as an unknown quantity enters into all the political economists equations without his knowledge and falsifies every one of their results the largest quantity of work will not be done by this curious engine for pay or under pressure or by help of any kind of fuel which may be supplied by the chaldron it will be done only when the motive force that is to say the will or spirit of the creature is brought to its greatest strength by its own proper fuel namely by the affections  it may indeed happen and does happen often that if the master is a man of sense and energy a large quantity of material work may be done under mechanical pressure enforced by strong will and guided by wise method also it may happen and does happen often that if the master is indolent and weak however goodnatured a very small quantity of work and that bad may be produced by the servants undirected strength and contemptuous gratitude but the universal law of the matter is that assuming any given quantity of energy and sense in master and servant the greatest material result obtainable by them will be not through antagonism to each other but through affection for each other and that if the master instead of endeavouring to get as much work as possible from the servant seeks rather to render his appointed and necessary work beneficial to him and to forward his interests in all just and wholesome ways the real amount of work ultimately done or of good rendered by the person so cared for will indeed be the greatest possible  observe i say of good rendered for a servants work is not necessarily or always the best thing he can give his master but good of all kinds whether in material service in protective watchfulness of his masters interest and credit or in joyful readiness to seize unexpected and irregular occasions of help  nor is this one whit less generally true because indulgence will be frequently abused and kindness met with ingratitude for the servant who gently treated is ungrateful treated ungently will be revengeful and the man who is dishonest to a liberal master will be injurious to an unjust one  in any case and with any person this unselfish treatment will produce the most effective return observe i am here considering the affections wholly as a motive power not at all as things in themselves desirable or noble or in any other way abstractedly good i look at them simply as an anomalous force rendering every one of the ordinary political economists calculations nugatory while even if he desired to introduce this new element into his estimates he has no power of dealing with it for the affections only become a true motive power when they ignore every other motive and condition of political economy treat the servant kindly with the idea of turning his gratitude to account and you will get as you deserve no gratitude nor any value for your kindness but treat him kindly without any economical purpose and all economical purposes will be answered in this as in all other matters whosoever will save his life shall lose it whoso loses it shall find it31     31 the difference between the two modes of treatment and         between their effective material results may be seen very         accurately by a comparison of the relations of esther and         charlie in bleak house with those of miss brass and the         marchioness in master humphreys clock          the essential value and truth of dickenss writings have         been unwisely lost sight of by many thoughtful persons         merely because he presents his truth with some colour of         caricature unwisely because dickenss caricature though         often gross is never mistaken allowing for his manner of         telling them the things he tells us are always true i wish         that he could think it right to limit his brilliant         exaggeration to works written only for public amusement and         when he takes up a subject of high national importance such         as that which he handled in hard times that he would use         severer and more accurate analysis the usefulness of that         work to my mind in several respects the greatest he has         written is with many persons seriously diminished because         mr bounderby is a dramatic monster instead of a         characteristic example of a worldly master and stephen         blackpool a dramatic perfection instead of a characteristic         example of an honest workman but let us not lose the use of         dickenss wit and insight because he chooses to speak in a         circle of stage fire he is entirely right in his main drift         and purpose in every book he has written and all of them         but especially hard times should be studied with close         and earnest care by persons interested in social questions         they will find much that is partial and because partial         apparently unjust but if they examine all the evidence on         the other side which dickens seems to overlook it will         appear after all their trouble that his view was the         finally right one grossly and sharply told  the next clearest and simplest example of relation between master and operative is that which exists between the commander of a regiment and his men  supposing the officer only desires to apply the rules of discipline so as with least trouble to himself to make the regiment most effective he will not be able by any rules or administration of rules on this selfish principle to develop the full strength of his subordinates if a man of sense and firmness he may as in the former instance produce a better result than would be obtained by the irregular kindness of a weak officer but let the sense and firmness be the same in both cases and assuredly the officer who has the most direct personal relations with his men the most care for their interests and the most value for their lives will develop their effective strength through their affection for his own person and trust in his character to a degree wholly unattainable by other means the law applies still more stringently as the numbers concerned are larger a charge may often be successful though the men dislike their officers a battle has rarely been won unless they loved their general  passing from these simple examples to the more complicated relations existing between a manufacturer and his workmen we are met first by certain curious difficulties resulting apparently from a harder and colder state of moral elements it is easy to imagine an enthusiastic affection existing among soldiers for the colonel not so easy to imagine an enthusiastic affection among cottonspinners for the proprietor of the mill a body of men associated for purposes of robbery as a highland clan in ancient times shall be animated by perfect affection and every member of it be ready to lay down his life for the life of his chief but a band of men associated for purposes of legal production and accumulation is usually animated it appears by no such emotions and none of them are in anywise willing to give his life for the life of his chief not only are we met by this apparent anomaly in moral matters but by others connected with it in administration of system for a servant or a soldier is engaged at a definite rate of wages for a definite period but a workman at a rate of wages variable according to the demand for labour and with the risk of being at any time thrown out of his situation by chances of trade now as under these contingencies no action of the affections can take place but only an explosive action of disaffections two points offer themselves for consideration in the matter  the firsthow far the rate of wages may be so regulated as not to vary with the demand for labour  the secondhow far it is possible that bodies of workmen may be engaged and maintained at such fixed rate of wages whatever the state of trade may be without enlarging or diminishing their number so as to give them permanent interest in the establishment with which they are connected like that of the domestic servants in an old family or an esprit de corps like that of the soldiers in a crack regiment  the first question is i say how far it may be possible to fix the rate of wages irrespectively of the demand for labour  perhaps one of the most curious facts in the history of human error is the denial by the common political economist of the possibility of thus regulating wages while for all the important and much of the unimportant labour on the earth wages are already so regulated  we do not sell our primeministership by dutch auction nor on the decease of a bishop whatever may be the general advantages of simony do we yet offer his diocese to the clergyman who will take the episcopacy at the lowest contract we with exquisite sagacity of political economy do indeed sell commissions but not openly generalships sick we do not inquire for a physician who takes less than a guinea litigious we never think of reducing sixandeightpence to fourandsixpence caught in a shower we do not canvass the cabmen to find one who values his driving at less than a sixpence a mile  it is true that in all these cases there is and in every conceivable case there must be ultimate reference to the presumed difficulty of the work or number of candidates for the office if it were thought that the labour necessary to make a good physician would be gone through by a sufficient number of students with the prospect of only halfguinea fees public consent would soon withdraw the unnecessary halfguinea in this ultimate sense the price of labour is indeed always regulated by the demand for it but so far as the practical and immediate administration of the matter is regarded the best labour always has been and is as all labour ought to be paid by an invariable standard  what the reader perhaps answers amazedly pay good and bad workmen alike  certainly the difference between one prelates sermons and his successorsor between one physicians opinion and anothersis far greater as respects the qualities of mind involved and far more important in result to you personally than the difference between good and bad laying of bricks though that is greater than most people suppose yet you pay with equal fee contentedly the good and bad workmen upon your soul and the good and bad workmen upon your body much more may you pay contentedly with equal fees the good and bad workmen upon your house  nay but i choose my physician and  my clergyman thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work by all means also choose your bricklayer that is the proper reward of the good workman to be chosen the natural and right system respecting all labour is that it should be paid at a fixed rate but the good workman employed and the bad workmen unemployed the false unnatural and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at halfprice and either take the place of the good or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum  this equality of wages then being the first object towards which we have to discover the directest available road the second is as above stated that of maintaining constant numbers of workmen in employment whatever may be the accidental demand for the article they produce  i believe the sudden and extensive inequalities of demand which necessarily arise in the mercantile operations of an active nation constitute the only essential difficulty which has to be overcome in a just organization of labour the subject opens into too many branches to admit of being investigated in a paper of this kind but the following general facts bearing on it may be noted  the wages which enable any workman to live are necessarily higher if his work is liable to intermission than if it is assured and continuous and however severe the struggle for work may become the general law will always hold that men must get more daily pay if on the average they can only calculate on work three days a week than they would require if they were sure of work six days a week supposing that a man cannot live on less than a shilling a day his seven shillings he must get either for three days violent work or six days deliberate work the tendency of all modern mercantile operations is to throw both wages and trade into the form of a lottery and to make the workmans pay depend on intermittent exertion and the principals profit on dexterously used chance  in what partial degree i repeat this may be necessary in consequence of the activities of modern trade i do not here investigate contenting myself with the fact that in its fatallest aspects it is assuredly unnecessary and results merely from love of gambling on the part of the masters and from ignorance and sensuality in the men the masters cannot bear to let any opportunity of gain escape them and frantically rush at every gap and breach in the walls of fortune raging to be rich and affronting with impatient covetousness every risk of ruin while the men prefer three days of violent labour and three days of drunkenness to six days of moderate work and wise rest there is no way in which a principal who really desires to help his workmen may do it more effectually than by checking these disorderly habits both in himself and them keeping his own business operations on a scale which will enable him to pursue them securely not yielding to temptations of precarious gain and at the same time leading his workmen into regular habits of labour and life either by inducing them rather to take low wages in the form of a fixed salary than high wages subject to the chance of their being thrown out of work or if this be impossible by discouraging the system of violent exertion for nominally high day wages and leading the men to take lower pay for more regular labour  in effecting any radical changes of this kind doubtless there would be great inconvenience and loss incurred by all the originators of movement that which can be done with perfect convenience and without loss is not always the thing that most needs to be done or which we are most imperatively required to do  i have already alluded to the difference hitherto existing between regiments of men associated for purposes of violence and for purposes of manufacture in that the former appear capable of selfsacrificethe latter not which singular fact is the real reason of the general lowness of estimate in which the profession of commerce is held as compared with that of arms philosophically it does not at first sight appear reasonable many writers have endeavoured to prove it unreasonable that a peaceable and rational person whose trade is buying and selling should be held in less honour than an unpeaceable and often irrational person whose trade is slaying nevertheless the consent of mankind has always in spite of the philosophers given precedence to the soldier  and this is right  for the soldiers trade verily and essentially is not slaying but being slain this without well knowing its own meaning the world honours it for a bravos trade is slaying but the world has never respected bravos more than merchants the reason it honours the soldier is because he holds his life at the service of the state reckless he may befond of pleasure or of adventureall kinds of byemotives and mean impulses may have determined the choice of his profession and may affect to all appearance exclusively his daily conduct in it but our estimate of him is based on this ultimate factof which we are well assuredthat put him in a fortress breach with all the pleasures of the world behind him and only death and his duty in front of him he will keep his face to the front and he knows that this choice may be put to him at any moment and has beforehand taken his partvirtually takes such part continuallydoes in reality die daily  not less is the respect we pay to the lawyer and physician founded ultimately on their selfsacrifice whatever the learning or acuteness of a great lawyer our chief respect for him depends on our belief that set in a judges seat he will strive to judge justly come of it what may could we suppose that he would take bribes and use his acuteness and legal knowledge to give plausibility to iniquitous decisions no degree of intellect would win for him our respect nothing will win it short of our tacit conviction that in all important acts of his life justice is first with him his own interest second  in the case of a physician the ground of the honour we render him is clearer still whatever his science we should shrink from him in horror if we found him regard his patients merely as subjects to experiment upon much more if we found that receiving bribes from persons interested in their deaths he was using his best skill to give poison in the mask of medicine  finally the principle holds with utmost clearness as it respects clergymen no goodness of disposition will excuse want of science in a physician or of shrewdness in an advocate but a clergyman even though his power of intellect be small is respected on the presumed ground of his unselfishness and serviceableness  now there can be no question but that the tact foresight decision and other mental powers required for the successful management of a large mercantile concern if not such as could be compared with those of a great lawyer general or divine would at least match the general conditions of mind required in the subordinate officers of a ship or of a regiment or in the curate of a country parish if therefore all the efficient members of the socalled liberal professions are still somehow in public estimate of honour preferred before the head of a commercial firm the reason must lie deeper than in the measurement of their several powers of mind  and the essential reason for such preference will be found to lie in the fact that the merchant is presumed to act always selfishly his work may be very necessary to the community but the motive of it is understood to be wholly personal the merchants first object in all his dealings must be the public believe to get as much for himself and leave as little to his neighbour or customer as possible enforcing this upon him by political statute as the necessary principle of his action recommending it to him on all occasions and themselves reciprocally adopting it proclaiming vociferously for law of the universe that a buyers function is to cheapen and a sellers to cheatthe public nevertheless involuntarily condemn the man of commerce for his compliance with their own statement and stamp him for ever as belonging to an inferior grade of human personality  this they will find eventually they must give up doing they must not cease to condemn selfishness but they will have to discover a kind of commerce which is not exclusively selfish or rather they will have to discover that there never was or can be any other kind of commerce that this which they have called commerce was not commerce at all but cozening and that a true merchant differs as much from a merchant according to laws of modern political economy as the hero of the excursion from autolycus they will find that commerce is an occupation which gentlemen will every day see more need to engage in rather than in the businesses of talking to men or slaying them that in true commerce as in true preaching or true fighting it is necessary to admit the idea of occasional voluntary loss that sixpences have to be lost as well as lives under a sense of duty that the market may have its martyrdoms as well as the pulpit and trade its heroisms as well as war  may havein the final issue must haveand only has not had yet because men of heroic temper have always been misguided in their youth into other fields not recognizing what is in our days perhaps the most important of all fields so that while many a zealous person loses his life in trying to teach the form of a gospel very few will lose a hundred pounds in showing the practice of one  the fact is that people never have had clearly explained to them the true functions of a merchant with respect to other people i should like the reader to be very clear about this  five great intellectual professions relating to daily necessities of life have hitherto existedthree exist necessarily in every civilized nation    the soldiers profession is to defend it    the pastors to teach it    the physicians to keep it in health    the lawyers to enforce justice in it    the merchants to provide for it    and the duty of all these men is on due occasion to die for it  on due occasion namely    the soldier rather than leave his post in battle    the physician rather than leave his post in plague    the pastor rather than teach falsehood    the lawyer rather than countenance injustice    the merchantwhat is his due occasion of death it is the main   question for the merchant as for all of us for truly the man who   does not know when to die does not know how to live  observe the merchants function or manufacturers for in the broad sense in which it is here used the word must be understood to include both is to provide for the nation it is no more his function to get profit for himself out of that provision than it is a clergymans function to get his stipend the stipend is a due and necessary adjunct but not the object of his life if he be a true clergyman any more than his fee or honorarium is the object of life to a true physician neither is his fee the object of life to a true merchant all three if true men have a work to be done irrespective of feeto be done even at any cost or for quite the contrary of fee the pastors function being to teach the physicians to heal and the merchants as i have said to provide that is to say he has to understand to their very root the qualities of the thing he deals in and the means of obtaining or producing it and he has to apply all his sagacity and energy to the producing or obtaining it in perfect state and distributing it at the cheapest possible price where it is most needed  and because the production or obtaining of any commodity involves necessarily the agency of many lives and hands the merchant becomes in the course of his business the master and governor of large masses of men in a more direct though less confessed way than a military officer or pastor so that on him falls in great part the responsibility for the kind of life they lead and it becomes his duty not only to be always considering how to produce what he sells in the purest and cheapest forms but how to make the various employments involved in the production or transference of it most beneficial to the men employed  and as into these two functions requiring for their right exercise the highest intelligence as well as patience kindness and tact the merchant is bound to put all his energy so for their just discharge he is bound as soldier or physician is bound to give up if need be his life in such way as it may be demanded of him two main points he has in his providing function to maintain first his engagements faithfulness to engagements being the real root of all possibilities in commerce and secondly the perfectness and purity of the thing provided so that rather than fail in any engagement or consent to any deterioration adulteration or unjust and exorbitant price of that which he provides he is bound to meet fearlessly any form of distress poverty or labour which may through maintenance of these points come upon him  again in his office as governor of the men employed by him the merchant or manufacturer is invested with a distinctly paternal authority and responsibility in most cases a youth entering a commercial establishment is withdrawn altogether from home influence his master must become his father else he has for practical and constant help no father at hand in all cases the masters authority together with the general tone and atmosphere of his business and the character of the men with whom the youth is compelled in the course of it to associate have more immediate and pressing weight than the home influence and will usually neutralize it either for good or evil so that the only means which the master has of doing justice to the men employed by him is to ask himself sternly whether he is dealing with such subordinate as he would with his own son if compelled by circumstances to take such a position  supposing the captain of a frigate saw it right or were by any chance obliged to place his own son in the position of a common sailor as he would then treat his son he is bound always to treat every one of the men under him so also supposing the master of a manufactory saw it right or were by any chance obliged to place his own son in the position of an ordinary workman as he would then treat his son he is bound always to treat every one of his men this is the only effective true or practical rule which can be given on this point of political economy  and as the captain of a ship is bound to be the last man to leave his ship in case of wreck and to share his last crust with the sailors in case of famine so the manufacturer in any commercial crisis or distress is bound to take the suffering of it with his men and even to take more of it for himself than he allows his men to feel as a father would in a famine shipwreck or battle sacrifice himself for his son  all which sounds very strange the only real strangeness in the matter being nevertheless that it should so sound for all this is true and that not partially nor theoretically but everlastingly and practically all other doctrine than this respecting matters political being false in premises absurd in deduction and impossible in practice consistently with any progressive state of national life all the life which we now possess as a nation showing itself in the resolute denial and scorn by a few strong minds and faithful hearts of the economic principles taught to our multitudes which principles so far as accepted lead straight to national destruction respecting the modes and forms of destruction to which they lead and on the other hand respecting the farther practical working of true polity i hope to reason further in a following paper     essay  ii  the veins of wealth   the answer which would be made by any ordinary political economist to the statements contained in the preceding paper is in few words as follows  it is indeed true that certain advantages of a general nature may be obtained by the development of social affections but political economists never professed nor profess to take advantages of a general nature into consideration our science is simply the science of getting rich so far from being a fallacious or visionary one it is found by experience to be practically effective persons who follow its precepts do actually become rich and persons who disobey them become poor every capitalist of europe has acquired his fortune by following the known laws of our science and increases his capital daily by an adherence to them it is vain to bring forward tricks of logic against the force of accomplished facts every man of business knows by experience how money is made and how it is lost  pardon me men of business do indeed know how they themselves made their money or how on occasion they lost it playing a longpractised game they are familiar with the chances of its cards and can rightly explain their losses and gains but they neither know who keeps the bank of the gamblinghouse nor what other games may be played with the same cards nor what other losses and gains far away among the dark streets are essentially though invisibly dependent on theirs in the lighted rooms they have learned a few and only a few of the laws of mercantile economy but not one of those of political economy  primarily which is very notable and curious i observe that men of business rarely know the meaning of the word rich at least if they know they do not in their reasonings allow for the fact that it is a relative word implying its opposite poor as positively as the word north implies its opposite south men nearly always speak and write as if riches were absolute and it were possible by following certain scientific precepts for everybody to be rich whereas riches are a power like that of electricity acting only through inequalities or negations of itself the force of the guinea you have in your pocket depends wholly on the default of a guinea in your neighbours pocket if he did not want it it would be of no use to you the degree of power it possesses depends accurately upon the need or desire he has for itand the art of making yourself rich in the ordinary mercantile economists sense is therefore equally and necessarily the art of keeping your neighbour poor  i would not contend in this matter and rarely in any matter for the acceptance of terms but i wish the reader clearly and deeply to understand the difference between the two economies to which the terms political and mercantile might not unadvisably be attached  political economy the economy of a state or of citizens consists simply in the production preservation and distribution at fittest time and place of useful or pleasurable things the farmer who cuts his hay at the right time the shipwright who drives his bolts well home in sound wood the builder who lays good bricks in welltempered mortar the housewife who takes care of her furniture in the parlour and guards against all waste in her kitchen and the singer who rightly disciplines and never overstrains her voice are all political economists in the true and final sense adding continually to the riches and wellbeing of the nation to which they belong  but mercantile economy the economy of merces or of pay signifies the accumulation in the hands of individuals of legal or moral claim upon or power over the labour of others every such claim implying precisely as much poverty or debt on one side as it implies riches or right on the other  it does not therefore necessarily involve an addition to the actual property or wellbeing of the state in which it exists but since this commercial wealth or power over labour is nearly always convertible at once into real property while real property is not always convertible at once into power over labour the idea of riches among active men in civilized nations generally refers to commercial wealth and in estimating their possessions they rather calculate the value of their horses and fields by the number of guineas they could get for them than the value of their guineas by the number of horses and fields they could buy with them  there is however another reason for this habit of mind namely that an accumulation of real property is of little use to its owner unless together with it he has commercial power over labour thus suppose any person to be put in possession of a large estate of fruitful land with rich beds of gold in its gravel countless herds of cattle in its pastures houses and gardens and storehouses full of useful stores but suppose after all that he could get no servants in order that he may be able to have servants some one in his neighbourhood must be poor and in want of his goldor his corn assume that no one is in want of either and that no servants are to be had he must therefore bake his own bread make his own clothes plough his own ground and shepherd his own flocks his gold will be as useful to him as any other yellow pebbles on his estate his stores must rot for he cannot consume them he can eat no more than another man could eat and wear no more than another man could wear he must lead a life of severe and common labour to procure even ordinary comforts he will be ultimately unable to keep either houses in repair or fields in cultivation and forced to content himself with a poor mans portion of cottage and garden in the midst of a desert of waste land trampled by wild cattle and encumbered by ruins of palaces which he will hardly mock at himself by calling his own  the most covetous of mankind would with small exultation i presume accept riches of this kind on these terms what is really desired under the name of riches is essentially power over men in its simplest sense the power of obtaining for our own advantage the labour of servant tradesman and artist in wider sense authority of directing large masses of the nation to various ends good trivial or hurtful according to the mind of the rich person and this power of wealth of course is greater or less in direct proportion to the poverty of the men over whom it is exercised and in inverse proportion to the number of persons who are as rich as ourselves and who are ready to give the same price for an article of which the supply is limited if the musician is poor he will sing for small pay as long as there is only one person who can pay him but if there be two or three he will sing for the one who offers him most and thus the power of the riches of the patron always imperfect and doubtful as we shall see presently even when most authoritative depends first on the poverty of the artist and then on the limitation of the number of equally wealthy persons who also wants seats at the concert so that as above stated the art of becoming rich in the common sense is not absolutely nor finally the art of accumulating much money for ourselves but also of contriving that our neighbours shall have less in accurate terms it is the art of establishing the maximum inequality in our own favour  now the establishment of such inequality cannot be shown in the abstract to be either advantageous or disadvantageous to the body of the nation the rash and absurd assumption that such inequalities are necessarily advantageous lies at the root of most of the popular fallacies on the subject of political economy for the eternal and inevitable law in this matter is that the beneficialness of the inequality depends first on the methods by which it was accomplished and secondly on the purposes to which it is applied inequalities of wealth unjustly established have assuredly injured the nation in which they exist during their establishment and unjustly directed injure it yet more during their existence but inequalities of wealth justly established benefit the nation in the course of their establishment and nobly used aid it yet more by their existence that is to say among every active and wellgoverned people the various strength of individuals tested by full exertion and specially applied to various need issues in unequal but harmonious results receiving reward or authority according to its class and service32 while in the inactive or illgoverned nation the gradations of decay and the victories of treason work out also their own rugged system of subjection and success and substitute for the melodious inequalities of concurrent power the iniquitous dominances and depressions of guilt and misfortune     32 i have been naturally asked several times with respect         to the sentence in the first of these papers the bad         workmen unemployed but what are you to do with your bad         unemployed workmen well it seems to me the question might         have occurred to you before your housemaids place is         vacantyou give twenty pounds a yeartwo girls come for         it one neatly dressed the other dirtily one with good         recommendations the other with none you do not under         these circumstances usually ask the dirty one if she will         come for fifteen pounds or twelve and on her consenting         take her instead of the wellrecommended one still less do         you try to beat both down by making them bid against each         other till you can hire both one at twelve pounds a year         and the other at eight you simply take the one fittest for         the place and send away the other not perhaps concerning         yourself quite as much as you should with the question which         you now impatiently put to me what is to become of her         for all that i advise you to do is to deal with workmen as         with servants and verily the question is of weight your         bad workman idler and roguewhat are you to do with him          we will consider of this presently remember that the         administration of a complete system of national commerce and         industry cannot be explained in full detail within the space         of twelve pages meantime consider whether there being         confessedly some difficulty in dealing with rogues and         idlers it may not be advisable to produce as few of them as         possible if you examine into the history of rogues you         will find they are as truly manufactured articles as         anything else and it is just because our present system of         political economy gives so large a stimulus to that         manufacture that you may know it to be a false one we had         better seek for a system which will develop honest men than         for one which will deal cunningly with vagabonds let us         reform our schools and we shall find little reform needed         in our prisons  thus the circulation of wealth in a nation resembles that of the blood in the natural body there is one quickness of the current which comes of cheerful emotion or wholesome exercise and another which comes of shame or of fever there is a flush of the body which is full of warmth and life and another which will pass into putrefaction  the analogy will hold down even to minute particulars for as diseased local determination of the blood involves depression of the general health of the system all morbid local action of riches will be found ultimately to involve a weakening of the resources of the body politic  the mode in which this is produced may be at once understood by examining one or two instances of the development of wealth in the simplest possible circumstances  suppose two sailors cast away on an uninhabited coast and obliged to maintain themselves there by their own labour for a series of years  if they both kept their health and worked steadily and in amity with each other they might build themselves a convenient house and in time come to possess a certain quantity of cultivated land together with various stores laid up for future use all these things would be real riches or property and supposing the men both to have worked equally hard they would each have right to equal share or use of it their political economy would consist merely in careful preservation and just division of these possessions perhaps however after some time one or other might be dissatisfied with the results of their common farming and they might in consequence agree to divide the land they had brought under the spade into equal shares so that each might thenceforward work in his own field and live by it suppose that after this arrangement had been made one of them were to fall ill and be unable to work on his land at a critical timesay of sowing or harvest  he would naturally ask the other to sow or reap for him  then his companion might say with perfect justice i will do this additional work for you but if i do it you must promise to do as much for me at another time i will count how many hours i spend on your ground and you shall give me a written promise to work for the same number of hours on mine whenever i need your help and you are able to give it  suppose the disabled mans sickness to continue and that under various circumstances for several years requiring the help of the other he on each occasion gave a written pledge to work as soon as he was able at his companions orders for the same number of hours which the other had given up to him what will the positions of the two men be when the invalid is able to resume work  considered as a polis or state they will be poorer than they would have been otherwise poorer by the withdrawal of what the sick mans labour would have produced in the interval his friend may perhaps have toiled with an energy quickened by the enlarged need but in the end his own land and property must have suffered by the withdrawal of so much of his time and thought from them and the united property of the two men will be certainly less than it would have been if both had remained in health and activity  but the relations in which they stand to each other are also widely altered the sick man has not only pledged his labour for some years but will probably have exhausted his own share of the accumulated stores and will be in consequence for some time dependent on the other for food which he can only pay or reward him for by yet more deeply pledging his own labour  supposing the written promises to be held entirely valid among civilized nations their validity is secured by legal measures33 the person who had hitherto worked for both might now if he chose rest altogether and pass his time in idleness not only forcing his companion to redeem all the engagements he had already entered into but exacting from him pledges for further labour to an arbitrary amount for what food he had to advance to him     33 the disputes which exist respecting the real nature of money         arise more from the disputants examining its functions on         different sides than from any real dissent in their         opinions all money properly so called is an         acknowledgment of debt but as such it may either be         considered to represent the labour and property of the         creditor or the idleness and penury of the debtor the         intricacy of the question has been much increased by the         hitherto necessary use of marketable commodities such as         gold silver salt shells etc to give intrinsic value or         security to currency but the final and best definition of         money is that it is a documentary promise ratified and         guaranteed by the nation to give or find a certain quantity         of labour on demand a mans labour for a day is a better         standard of value than a measure of any produce because no         produce ever maintains a consistent rate of productibility  there might not from first to last be the least illegality in the ordinary sense of the word in the arrangement but if a stranger arrived on the coast at this advanced epoch of their political economy he would find one man commercially rich the other commercially poor he would see perhaps with no small surprise one passing his days in idleness the other labouring for both and living sparely in the hope of recovering his independence at some distant period  this is of course an example of one only out of many ways in which inequality of possession may be established between different persons giving rise to the mercantile forms of riches and poverty in the instance before us one of the men might from the first have deliberately chosen to be idle and to put his life in pawn for present ease or he might have mismanaged his land and been compelled to have recourse to his neighbour for food and help pledging his future labour for it but what i want the reader to note especially is the fact common to a large number of typical cases of this kind that the establishment of the mercantile wealth which consists in a claim upon labour signifies a political diminution of the real wealth which consists in substantial possessions  take another example more consistent with the ordinary course of affairs of trade suppose that three men instead of two formed the little isolated republic and found themselves obliged to separate in order to farm different pieces of land at some distance from each other along the coast each estate furnishing a distinct kind of produce and each more or less in need of the material raised on the other suppose that the third man in order to save the time of all three undertakes simply to superintend the transference of commodities from one farm to the other on condition of receiving some sufficiently remunerative share of every parcel of goods conveyed or of some other parcel received in exchange for it  if this carrier or messenger always brings to each estate from the other what is chiefly wanted at the right time the operations of the two farmers will go on prosperously and the largest possible result in produce or wealth will be attained by the little community but suppose no intercourse between the landowners is possible except through the travelling agent and that after a time this agent watching the course of each mans agriculture keeps back the articles with which he has been entrusted until there comes a period of extreme necessity for them on one side or other and then exacts in exchange for them all that the distressed farmer can spare of other kinds of produce it is easy to see that by ingeniously watching his opportunities he might possess himself regularly of the greater part of the superfluous produce of the two estates and at last in some year of severest trial or scarcity purchase both for himself and maintain the former proprietors thenceforward as his labourers or servants  this would be a case of commercial wealth acquired on the exactest principles of modern political economy but more distinctly even than in the former instance it is manifest in this that the wealth of the state or of the three men considered as a society is collectively less than it would have been had the merchant been content with juster profit the operations of the two agriculturists have been cramped to the utmost and the continual limitations of the supply of things they wanted at critical times together with the failure of courage consequent on the prolongation of a struggle for mere existence without any sense of permanent gain must have seriously diminished the effective results of their labour and the stores finally accumulated in the merchants hands will not in anywise be of equivalent value to those which had his dealings been honest would have filled at once the granaries of the farmers and his own  the whole question therefore respecting not only the advantage but even the quantity of national wealth resolves itself finally into one of abstract justice it is impossible to conclude of any given mass of acquired wealth merely by the fact of its existence whether it signifies good or evil to the nation in the midst of which it exists its real value depends on the moral sign attached to it just as sternly as that of a mathematical quantity depends on the algebraical sign attached to it any given accumulation of commercial wealth may be indicative on the one hand of faithful industries progressive energies and productive ingenuities or on the other it may be indicative of mortal luxury merciless tyranny ruinous chicane some treasures are heavy with human tears as an illstored harvest with untimely rain and some gold is brighter in sunshine than it is in substance  and these are not observe merely moral or pathetic attributes of riches which the seeker of riches may if he chooses despise they are literally and sternly material attributes of riches depreciating or exalting incalculably the monetary signification of the sum in question one mass of money is the outcome of action which has createdanother of action which has annihilatedten times as much in the gathering of it such and such strong hands have been paralysed as if they had been numbed by nightshade so many strong mens courage broken so many productive operations hindered this and the other false direction given to labour and lying image of prosperity set up on dura plains dug into seventimesheated furnaces that which seems to be wealth may in verity be only the gilded index of farreaching ruin a wreckers handful of coin gleaned from the beach to which he has beguiled an argosy a campfollowers bundle of rags unwrapped from the breasts of goodly soldiers dead the purchasepieces of potters fields wherein shall be buried together the citizen and the stranger  and therefore the idea that directions can be given for the gaining of wealth irrespectively of the consideration of its moral sources or that any general and technical law of purchase and gain can be set down for national practice is perhaps the most insolently futile of all that ever beguiled men through their vices so far as i know there is not in history record of anything so disgraceful to the human intellect as the modern idea that the commercial text buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest represents or under any circumstances could represent an available principle of national economy buy in the cheapest marketyes but what made your market cheap charcoal may be cheap among your roof timbers after a fire and bricks may be cheap in your streets after an earthquake but fire and earthquake may not therefore be national benefits sell in the dearestyes truly but what made your market dear you sold your bread well today was it to a dying man who gave his last coin for it and will never need bread more or to a rich man who tomorrow will buy your farm over your head or to a soldier on his way to pillage the bank in which you have put your fortune  none of these things you can know one thing only you can know namely whether this dealing of yours is a just and faithful one which is all you need concern yourself about respecting it sure thus to have done your own part in bringing about ultimately in the world a state of things which will not issue in pillage or in death and thus every question concerning these things merges itself ultimately in the great question of justice which the ground being thus far cleared for it i will enter upon in the next paper leaving only in this three final points for the readers consideration  it has been shown that the chief value and virtue of money consists in its having power over human beings that without this power large material possessions are useless and to any person possessing such power comparatively unnecessary but power over human beings is attainable by other means than by money as i said a few pages back the money power is always imperfect and doubtful there are many things which cannot be reached with it others which cannot be retained by it many joys may be given to men which cannot be bought for gold and many fidelities found in them which cannot be rewarded with it  trite enoughthe reader thinks yes but it is not so tritei wish it werethat in this moral power quite inscrutable and immeasurable though it be there is a monetary value just as real as that represented by more ponderous currencies a mans hand may be full of invisible gold and the wave of it or the grasp shall do more than anothers with a shower of bullion this invisible gold also does not necessarily diminish in spending political economists will do well some day to take heed of it though they cannot take measure  but farther since the essence of wealth consists in its authority over men if the apparent or nominal wealth fail in this power it fails in essence in fact ceases to be wealth at all it does not appear lately in england that our authority over men is absolute the servants show some disposition to rush riotously upstairs under an impression that their wages are not regularly paid we should augur ill of any gentlemans property to whom this happened every other day in his drawingroom  so also the power of our wealth seems limited as respects the comfort of the servants no less than their quietude the persons in the kitchen appear to be illdressed squalid halfstarved one cannot help imagining that the riches of the establishment must be of a very theoretical and documentary character  finally since the essence of wealth consists in power over men will it not follow that the nobler and the more in number the persons are over whom it has power the greater the wealth perhaps it may even appear after some consideration that the persons themselves are the wealththat these pieces of gold with which we are in the habit of guiding them are in fact nothing more than a kind of byzantine harness or trappings very glittering and beautiful in barbaric sight wherewith we bridle the creatures but that if these same living creatures could be guided without the fretting and jingling of the byzants in their mouths and ears they might themselves be more valuable than their bridles in fact it may be discovered that the true veins of wealth are purpleand not in rock but in fleshperhaps even that the final outcome and consummation of all wealth is in the producing as many as possible fullbreathed brighteyed and happyhearted human creatures our modern wealth i think has rather a tendency the other waymost political economists appearing to consider multitudes of human creatures not conducive to wealth or at best conducive to it only by remaining in a dimeyed and narrowchested state of being  nevertheless it is open i repeat to serious question which i leave to the readers pondering whether among national manufactures that of souls of a good quality may not at last turn out a quite leadingly lucrative one nay in some faraway and yet undreamtof hour i can even imagine that england may cast all thoughts of possessive wealth back to the barbaric nations among whom they first arose and that while the sands of the indus and adamant of golconda may yet stiffen the housings of the charger and flash from the turban of the slave she as a christian mother may at last attain to the virtues and the treasures of a heathen one and be able to lead forth her sons saying    these are my jewels     essay iii  qui judicatis terram   some centuries before the christian era a jew merchant largely engaged in business on the gold coast and reported to have made one of the largest fortunes of his time held also in repute for much practical sagacity left among his ledgers some general maxims concerning wealth which have been preserved strangely enough even to our own days they were held in considerable respect by the most active traders of the middle ages especially by the venetians who even went so far in their admiration as to place a statue of the old jew on the angle of one of their principal public buildings of late years these writings have fallen into disrepute being opposed in every particular to the spirit of modern commerce nevertheless i shall reproduce a passage or two from them here partly because they may interest the reader by their novelty and chiefly because they will show him that it is possible for a very practical and acquisitive tradesman to hold through a not unsuccessful career that principle of distinction between wellgotten and illgotten wealth which partially insisted on in my last paper it must be our work more completely to examine in this  he says for instance in one place the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death adding in another with the same meaning he has a curious way of doubling his sayings treasures of wickedness profit nothing but justice delivers from death both these passages are notable for their assertion of death as the only real issue and sum of attainment by any unjust scheme of wealth if we read instead of lying tongue lying label title pretence or advertisement we shall more clearly perceive the bearing of the words on modern business the seeking of death is a grand expression of the true course of mens toil in such business we usually speak as if death pursued us and we fled from him but that is only so in rare instances ordinarily he masks himselfmakes himself beautifulallglorious not like the kings daughter allglorious within but outwardly his clothing of wrought gold we pursue him frantically all our days he flying or hiding from us our crowning success at threescore and ten is utterly and perfectly to seize and hold him in his eternal integrityrobes ashes and sting  again the merchant says he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches shall surely come to want and again more strongly rob not the poor because he is poor neither oppress the afflicted in the place of business for god shall spoil the soul of those that spoiled them  this robbing the poor because he is poor is especially the mercantile form of theft consisting in taking advantage of a mans necessities in order to obtain his labour or property at a reduced price the ordinary highwaymans opposite form of robberyof the rich because he is richdoes not appear to occur so often to the old merchants mind probably because being less profitable and more dangerous than the robbery of the poor it is rarely practised by persons of discretion  but the two most remarkable passages in their deep general significance are the following  the rich and the poor have met god is their maker  the rich and the poor have met god is their light  they have met more literally have stood in each others way obviaverunt that is to say as long as the world lasts the action and counteraction of wealth and poverty the meeting face to face of rich and poor is just as appointed and necessary a law of that world as the flow of stream to sea or the interchange of power among the electric cloudsgod is their maker but also this action may be either gentle and just or convulsive and destructive it may be by rage of devouring flood or by lapse of serviceable wavein blackness of thunderstroke or continual force of vital fire soft and shapeable into lovesyllables from far away and which of these it shall be depends on both rich and poor knowing that god is their light that in the mystery of human life there is no other light than this by which they can see each others faces and livelight which is called in another of the books among which the merchants maxims have been preserved the sun of justice34 of which it is promised that it shall rise at last with healing healthgiving or helping making whole or setting at one in its wings for truly this healing is only possible by means of justice no love no faith no hope will do it men will be unwisely fondvainly faithful unless primarily they are just and the mistake of the best men through generation after generation has been that great one of thinking to help the poor by almsgiving and by preaching of patience or of hope and by every other means emollient or consolatory except the one thing which god orders for them justice but this justice with its accompanying holiness or helpfulness being even by the best men denied in its trial time is by the mass of men hated wherever it appears so that when the choice was one day fairly put to them they denied the helpful one and the just35 and desired a murderer seditionraiser and robber to be granted to themthe murderer instead of the lord of life the seditionraiser instead of the prince of peace and the robber instead of the just judge of all the world     34 more accurately sun of justness but instead of the harsh         word justness the old english righteousness being         commonly employed has by getting confused with         godliness or attracting about it various vague and broken         meanings prevented most persons from receiving the force of         the passages in which it occurs the word righteousness         properly refers to the justice of rule or right as         distinguished from equity which refers to the justice of         balance more broadly righteousness is kings justice and         equity judges justice the king guiding or ruling all the         judge dividing or discerning between opposites therefore         the double question man who made me a rulergreek         dikastêsor a dividergreek meristêsover you         thus with respect to the justice of choice selection the         feebler and passive justice we have from legolex         legal loi and loyal and with respect to the justice of         rule direction the stronger and active justice we have         from regorex regal roi and royal     35 in another place written with the same meaning just and         having salvation  i have just spoken of the flowing of streams to the sea as a partial image of the action of wealth in one respect it is not a partial but a perfect image the popular economist thinks himself wise in having discovered that wealth or the forms of property in general must go where they are required that where demand is supply must follow he farther declares that this course of demand and supply cannot be forbidden by human laws precisely in the same sense and with the same certainty the waters of the world go where they are required where the land falls the water flows the course neither of clouds nor rivers can be forbidden by human will but the disposition and administration of them can be altered by human forethought whether the stream shall be a curse or a blessing depends upon mans labour and administrating intelligence for centuries after centuries great districts of the world rich in soil and favoured in climate have lain desert under the rage of their own rivers not only desert but plaguestruck the stream which rightly directed would have flowed in soft irrigation from field to fieldwould have purified the air given food to man and beast and carried their burdens for them on its bosomnow overwhelms the plain and poisons the wind its breath pestilence and its work famine in like manner this wealth goes where it is required no human laws can withstand its flow they can only guide it but this the leading trench and limiting mound can do so thoroughly that it shall become water of lifethe riches of the hand of wisdom36 or on the contrary by leaving it to its own lawless flow they may make it what it has been too often the last and deadliest of national plagues water of marahthe water which feeds the roots of all evil     36 length of days in her right hand in her left riches         and honour  the necessity of these laws of distribution or restraint is curiously overlooked in the ordinary political economists definition of his own science he calls it shortly the science of getting rich but there are many sciences as well as many arts of getting rich poisoning people of large estates was one employed largely in the middle ages adulteration of food of people of small estates is one employed largely now the ancient and honourable highland method of black mail the more modern and less honourable system of obtaining goods on credit and the other variously improved methods of appropriationwhich in major and minor scales of industry down to the most artistic pocketpicking we owe to recent geniusall come under the general head of sciences or arts of getting rich  so that it is clear the popular economist in calling his science the science par excellence of getting rich must attach some peculiar ideas of limitation to its character i hope i do not misrepresent him by assuming that he means his science to be the science of getting rich by legal or just means in this definition is the word just or legal finally to stand for it is possible among certain nations or under certain rulers or by help of certain advocates that proceedings may be legal which are by no means just if therefore we leave at last only the word just in that place of our definition the insertion of this solitary and small word will make a notable difference in the grammar of our science for then it will follow that in order to grow rich scientifically we must grow rich justly and therefore know what is just so that our economy will no longer depend merely on prudence but on jurisprudenceand that of divine not human law which prudence is indeed of no mean order holding itself as it were high in the air of heaven and gazing for ever on the light of the sun of justice hence the souls which have excelled in it are represented by dante as stars forming in heaven for ever the figure of the eye of an eagle they having been in life the discerners of light from darkness or to the whole human race as the light of the body which is the eye while those souls which form the wings of the bird giving power and dominion to justice healing in its wings trace also in light the inscription in heaven diligite justitiam qui judicatis terram ye who judge the earth give not observe merely love but diligent love to justice the love which seeks diligently that is to say choosingly and by preference to all things else which judging or doing judgment in the earth is according to their capacity and position required not of judges only nor of rulers only but of all men37 a truth sorrowfully lost sight of even by those who are ready enough to apply to themselves passages in which christian men are spoken of as called to be saints ie to helpful or healing functions and chosen to be kings ie to knowing or directing functions the true meaning of these titles having been long lost through the pretences of unhelpful and unable persons to saintly and kingly character also through the once popular idea that both the sanctity and royalty are to consist in wearing long robes and high crowns instead of in mercy and judgment whereas all true sanctity is saving power as all true royalty is ruling power and injustice is part and parcel of the denial of such power which makes men as the creeping things as the fishes of the sea that have no ruler over them38     37 i hear that several of our lawyers have been greatly         amused by the statement in the first of these papers that a         lawyers function was to do justice i did not intend it for         a jest nevertheless it will be seen that in the above         passage neither the determination nor doing of justice are         contemplated as functions wholly peculiar to the lawyer         possibly the more our standing armies whether of soldiers         pastors or legislators the generic term pastor including         all teachers and the generic term lawyer including makers         as well as interpreters of law can be superseded by the         force of national heroism wisdom and honesty the better         it may be for the nation     38 it being the privilege of the fishes as it is of rats and         wolves to live by the laws of demand and supply but the         distinction of humanity to live by those of right  absolute justice is indeed no more attainable than absolute truth but the righteous man is distinguished from the unrighteous by his desire and hope of justice as the true man from the false by his desire and hope of truth and though absolute justice be unattainable as much justice as we need for all practical use is attainable by all those who make it their aim  we have to examine then in the subject before us what are the laws of justice respecting payment of labourno small part these of the foundations of all jurisprudence  i reduced in my last paper the idea of money payment to its simplest or radical terms in those terms its nature and the conditions of justice respecting it can be best ascertained  money payment as there stated consists radically in a promise to some person working for us that for the time and labour he spends in our service today we will give or procure equivalent time and labour in his service at any future time when he may demand it39     39 it might appear at first that the market price of labour         expressed such an exchange but this is a fallacy for the         market price is the momentary price of the kind of labour         required but the just price is its equivalent of the         productive labour of mankind this difference will be         analysed in its place it must be noted also that i speak         here only of the exchangeable value of labour not of that         of commodities the exchangeable value of a commodity is         that of the labour required to produce it multiplied         into the force of the demand for it if the value of the         labour  x and the force of demand  y the exchangeable         value of the commodity is xy in which if either x  0         or y  0 xy  0  if we promise to give him less labour than he has given us we underpay him if we promise to give him more labour than he has given us we overpay him in practice according to the laws of demand and supply when two men are ready to do the work and only one man wants to have it done the two men underbid each other for it and the one who gets it to do is underpaid but when two men want the work done and there is only one man ready to do it the two men who want it done overbid each other and the workman is overpaid  i will examine these two points of injustice in succession but first i wish the reader to clearly understand the central principle lying between the two of right or just payment  when we ask a service of any man he may either give it us freely or demand payment for it respecting free gift of service there is no question at present that being a matter of affectionnot of traffic but if he demand payment for it and we wish to treat him with absolute equity it is evident that this equity can only consist in giving time for time strength for strength and skill for skill if a man works an hour for us and we only promise to work half an hour for him in return we obtain an unjust advantage if on the contrary we promise to work an hour and a half for him in return he has an unjust advantage the justice consists in absolute exchange or if there be any respect to the stations of the parties it will not be in favour of the employer there is certainly no equitable reason in a mans being poor that if he give me a pound of bread today i should return him less than a pound of bread tomorrow or any equitable reason in a mans being uneducated that if he uses a certain quantity of skill and knowledge in my service i should use a less quantity of skill and knowledge in his perhaps ultimately it may appear desirable or to say the least gracious that i should give in return somewhat more than i received but at present we are concerned on the law of justice only which is that of perfect and accurate exchangeone circumstance only interfering with the simplicity of this radical idea of just paymentthat inasmuch as labour rightly directed is fruitful just as seed is the fruit or interest as it is called of the labour first given or advanced ought to be taken into account and balanced by an additional quantity of labour in the subsequent repayment supposing the repayment to take place at the end of a year or of any other given time this calculation could be approximately made but as money that is to say cash payment involves no reference to time it being optional with the person paid to spend what he receives at once or after any number of years we can only assume generally that some slight advantage must in equity be allowed to the person who advances the labour so that the typical form of bargain will be if you give me an hour today i will give you an hour and five minutes on demand if you give me a pound of bread today i will give you seventeen ounces on demand and so on all that is necessary for the reader to note is that the amount returned is at least in equity not to be less than the amount given  the abstract idea then of just or due wages as respects the labourer is that they will consist in a sum of money which will at any time procure for him at least as much labour as he has given rather more than less and this equity or justice of payment is observe wholly independent of any reference to the number of men who are willing to do the work i want a horseshoe for my horse twenty smiths or twenty thousand smiths may be ready to forge it their number does not in one atoms weight affect the question of the equitable payment of the one who does forge it it costs him a quarter of an hour of his life and so much skill and strength of arm to make that horseshoe for me then at some future time i am bound in equity to give a quarter of an hour and some minutes more of my life or of some other persons at my disposal and also as much strength of arm and skill and a little more in making or doing what the smith may have need of  such being the abstract theory of just remunerative payment its application is practically modified by the fact that the order for labour given in payment is general while the labour received is special the current coin or document is practically an order on the nation for so much work of any kind and this universal applicability to immediate need renders it so much more valuable than special labour can be that an order for a less quantity of this general toil will always be accepted as a just equivalent for a greater quantity of special toil any given craftsman will always be willing to give an hour of his own work in order to receive command over half an hour or even much less of national work this source of uncertainty together with the difficulty of determining the monetary value of skill40 renders the ascertainment even approximate of the proper wages of any given labour in terms of currency matter of considerable complexity but they do not affect the principle of exchange the worth of the work may not be easily known but it has a worth just as fixed and real as the specific gravity of a substance though such specific gravity may not be easily ascertainable when the substance is united with many others nor is there so much difficulty or chance in determining it as in determining the ordinary maxima and minima of vulgar political economy there are few bargains in which the buyer can ascertain with anything like precision that the seller would have taken no lessor the seller acquire more than a comfortable faith that the purchaser would have given no more this impossibility of precise knowledge prevents neither from striving to attain the desired point of greatest vexation and injury to the other nor from accepting it for a scientific principle that he is to buy for the least and sell for the most possible though what the real least or most may be he cannot tell in like manner a just person lays it down for a scientific principle that he is to pay a just price and without being able precisely to ascertain the limits of such a price will nevertheless strive to attain the closest possible approximation to them a practically serviceable approximation he can obtain it is easier to determine scientifically what a man ought to have for his work than what his necessities will compel him to take for it his necessities can only be ascertained by empirical but his due by analytical investigation in the one case you try your answer to the sum like a puzzled schoolboytill you find one that fits in the other you bring out your result within certain limits by process of calculation     40 under the term skill i mean to include the united force of         experience intellect and passion in their operation on         manual labour and under the term passion to include the         entire range and agency of the moral feelings from the         simple patience and gentleness of mind which will give         continuity and fineness to the touch or enable one person         to work without fatigue and with good effect twice as long         as another up to the qualities of character which render         science possiblethe retardation of science by envy is one         of the most tremendous losses in the economy of the present         centuryand to the incommunicable emotion and imagination         which are the first and mightiest sources of all value in         art          it is highly singular that political economists should not         yet have perceived if not the moral at least the         passionate element to be an inextricable quantity in every         calculation i cannot conceive for instance how it was         possible that mr mill should have followed the true clue so         far as to writeno limit can be set to the         importanceeven in a purely productive and material point         of viewof mere thought without seeing that it was         logically necessary to add also and of mere feeling and         this the more because in his first definition of labour he         includes in the idea of it all feelings of a disagreeable         kind connected with the employment of ones thoughts in a         particular occupation true but why not also feelings of         an agreeable kind it can hardly be supposed that the         feelings which retard labour are more essentially a part of         the labour than those which accelerate it the first are         paid for as pain the second as power the workman is merely         indemnified for the first but the second both produce a         part of the exchangeable value of the work and materially         increase its actual quantity          fritz is with us he is worth fifty thousand men truly         a large addition to the material forceconsisting         however be it observed not more in operations carried on         in fritzs head than in operations carried on in his         armies heart no limit can be set to the importance of         mere thought perhaps not nay suppose some day it         should turn out that mere thought was in itself a         recommendable object of production and that all material         production was only a step towards this more precious         immaterial one  supposing then the just wages of any quantity of given labour to have been ascertained let us examine the first results of just and unjust payment when in favour of the purchaser or employer ie when two men are ready to do the work and only one wants to have it done  the unjust purchaser forces the two to bid against each other till he has reduced their demand to its lowest terms let us assume that the lowest bidder offers to do the work at half its just price  the purchaser employs him and does not employ the other the first or apparent result is therefore that one of the two men is left out of employ or to starvation just as definitely as by the just procedure of giving fair price to the best workman the various writers who endeavoured to invalidate the positions of my first paper never saw this and assumed that the unjust hirer employed both he employs both no more than the just hirer the only difference in the outset is that the just man pays sufficiently the unjust man insufficiently for the labour of the single person employed  i say in the outset for this first or apparent difference is not the actual difference by the unjust procedure half the proper price of the work is left in the hands of the employer this enables him to hire another man at the same unjust rate on some other kind of work and the final result is that he has two men working for him at halfprice and two are out of employ  by the just procedure the whole price of the first piece of work goes into the hands of the man who does it no surplus being left in the employers hands he cannot hire another man for another piece of labour but by precisely so much as his power is diminished the hired workmans power is increased that is to say by the additional half of the price he has received which additional half he has the power of using to employ another man in his service i will suppose for the moment the least favourable though quite probable casethat though justly treated himself he yet will act unjustly to his subordinate and hire at halfprice if he can the final result will then be that one man works for the employer at just price one for the workman at halfprice and two as in the first case are still out of employ these two as i said before are out of employ in both cases the difference between the just and unjust procedure does not lie in the number of men hired but in the price paid to them and the persons by whom it is paid the essential difference that which i want the reader to see clearly is that in the unjust case two men work for one the first hirer in the just case one man works for the first hirer one for the person hired and so on down or up through the various grades of service the influence being carried forward by justice and arrested by injustice the universal and constant action of justice in this matter is therefore to diminish the power of wealth in the hands of one individual over masses of men and to distribute it through a chain of men the actual power exerted by the wealth is the same in both cases but by injustice it is put all into one mans hands so that he directs at once and with equal force the labour of a circle of men about him by the just procedure he is permitted to touch the nearest only through whom with diminished force modified by new minds the energy of the wealth passes on to others and so till it exhausts itself  the immediate operation of justice in this respect is therefore to diminish the power of wealth first in acquisition of luxury and secondly in exercise of moral influence the employer cannot concentrate so multitudinous labour on his own interests nor can he subdue so multitudinous mind to his own will but the secondary operation of justice is not less important the insufficient payment of the group of men working for one places each under a maximum of difficulty in rising above his position the tendency of the system is to check advancement but the sufficient or just payment distributed through a descending series of offices or grades of labour41 gives each subordinated person fair and sufficient means of rising in the social scale if he chooses to use them and thus not only diminishes the immediate power of wealth but removes the worst disabilities of poverty     41 i am sorry to lose time by answering however curtly the         equivocations of the writers who sought to obscure the         instances given of regulated labour in the first of these         papers by confusing kinds ranks and quantities of labour         with its qualities i never said that a colonel should have         the same pay as a private nor a bishop the same pay as a         curate neither did i say that more work ought to be paid as         less work so that the curate of a parish of two thousand         souls should have no more than the curate of a parish of         five hundred but i said that so far as you employ it at         all bad work should be paid no less than good work as a         bad clergyman yet takes his tithes a bad physician takes         his fee and a bad lawyer his costs and this as will be         farther shown in the conclusion i said and say partly         because the best work never was nor ever will be done for         money at all but chiefly because the moment people know         they have to pay the bad and good alike they will try to         discern the one from the other and not use the bad a         sagacious writer in the scotsman asks me if i should like         any common scribbler to be paid by messrs smith elder and         co the original publishers of this work as their good         authors are i should if they employed himbut would         seriously recommend them for the scribblers sake as well         as their own not to employ him the quantity of its money         which the country at present invests in scribbling is not         in the outcome of it economically spent and even the         highly ingenious person to whom this question occurred         might perhaps have been more beneficially employed than in         printing it  it is on this vital problem that the entire destiny of the labourer is ultimately dependent many minor interests may sometimes appear to interfere with it but all branch from it for instance considerable agitation is often caused in the minds of the lower classes when they discover the share which they nominally and to all appearance actually pay out of their wages in taxation i believe thirtyfive or forty per cent this sounds very grievous but in reality the labourer does not pay it but his employer if the workman had not to pay it his wages would be less by just that sum competition would still reduce them to the lowest rate at which life was possible similarly the lower orders agitated for the repeal of the corn laws42 thinking they would be better off if bread were cheaper never perceiving that as soon as bread was permanently cheaper wages would permanently fall in precisely that proportion the corn laws were rightly repealed not however because they directly oppressed the poor but because they indirectly oppressed them in causing a large quantity of their labour to be consumed unproductively so also unnecessary taxation oppresses them through destruction of capital but the destiny of the poor depends primarily always on this one question of dueness of wages their distress irrespectively of that caused by sloth minor error or crime arises on the grand scale from the two reacting forces of competition and oppression there is not yet nor will yet for ages be any real overpopulation in the world but a local overpopulation or more accurately a degree of population locally unmanageable under existing circumstances for want of forethought and sufficient machinery necessarily shows itself by pressure of competition and the taking advantage of this competition by the purchaser to obtain their labour unjustly cheap consummates at once their suffering and his own for in this as i believe in every other kind of slavery the oppressor suffers at last more than the oppressed and those magnificent lines of pope even in all their force fall short of the truth    yet to be just to these poor men of pelf   each does but hate his neighbour as himself   damned to the mines an equal fate betides   the slave that digs it and the slave that hides     42 i have to acknowledge an interesting communication on the         subject of free trade from paisley for a short letter from         a wellwisher at  my thanks are yet more due but         the scottish writer will i fear be disagreeably surprised         to hear that i am and always have been an utterly         fearless and unscrupulous free trader seven years ago         speaking of the various signs of infancy in the european         mind stones of venice vol iii p 168 i wrote the         first principles of commerce were acknowledged by the         english parliament only a few months ago in its free trade         measures and are still so little understood by the million         that no nation dares to abolish its customhouses          it will be observed that i do not admit even the idea of         reciprocity let other nations if they like keep their         ports shut every wise nation will throw its own open it is         not the opening them but a sudden inconsiderate and         blunderingly experimental manner of opening them which does         harm if you have been protecting a manufacture for a long         series of years you must not take the protection off in a         moment so as to throw every one of its operatives at once         out of employ any more than you must take all its wrappings         off a feeble child at once in cold weather though the         cumber of them may have been radically injuring its health         little by little you must restore it to freedom and to air          most peoples minds are in curious confusion on the subject         of free trade because they suppose it to imply enlarged         competition on the contrary free trade puts an end to all         competition protection among various other mischievous         functions endeavours to enable one country to compete with         another in the production of an article at a disadvantage         when trade is entirely free no country can be competed with         in the articles for the production of which it is naturally         calculated nor can it compete with any other in the         production of articles for which it is not naturally         calculated tuscany for instance cannot compete with         england in steel nor england with tuscany in oil they must         exchange their steel and oil which exchange should be as         frank and free as honesty and the seawinds can make it         competition indeed arises at first and sharply in order         to prove which is strongest in any given manufacture         possible to both this point once ascertained competition         is at an end  the collateral and reversionary operations of justice in this matter i shall examine hereafter it being needful first to define the nature of value proceeding then to consider within what practical terms a juster system may be established and ultimately the vexed question of the destinies of the unemployed workmen43 lest however the reader should be alarmed at some of the issues to which our investigations seem to be tending as if in their bearing against the power of wealth they had something in common with those of socialism i wish him to know in accurate terms one or two of the main points which i have in view     43 i should be glad if the reader would first clear the ground         for himself so far as to determine whether the difficulty         lies in getting the work or getting the pay for it does he         consider occupation itself to be an expensive luxury         difficult of attainment of which too little is to be found         in the world or is it rather that while in the enjoyment         even of the most athletic delight men must nevertheless be         maintained and this maintenance is not always forthcoming         we must be clear on this head before going farther as most         people are loosely in the habit of talking of the difficulty         of finding employment is it employment that we want to         find or support during employment is it idleness we wish         to put an end to or hunger we have to take up both         questions in succession only not both at the same time no         doubt that work is a luxury and a very great one it is         indeed at once a luxury and a necessity no man can retain         either health of mind or body without it so profoundly do i         feel this that as will be seen in the sequel one of the         principal objects i would recommend to benevolent and         practical persons is to induce rich people to seek for a         larger quantity of this luxury than they at present possess         nevertheless it appears by experience that even this         healthiest of pleasures may be indulged in to excess and         that human beings are just as liable to surfeit of labour as         to surfeit of meat so that as on the one hand it may be         charitable to provide for some people lighter dinner and         more workfor others it may be equally expedient to         provide lighter work and more dinner  whether socialism has made more progress among the army and navy where payment is made on my principles or among the manufacturing operatives who are paid on my opponents principles i leave it to those opponents to ascertain and declare whatever their conclusions may be i think it necessary to answer for myself only this that if there be any one point insisted on throughout my works more frequently than another that one point is the impossibility of equality my continual aim has been to show the eternal superiority of some men to others sometimes even of one man to all others and to show also the advisability of appointing such persons or person to guide to lead or on occasion even to compel and subdue their inferiors according to their own better knowledge and wiser will my principles of political economy were all involved in a single phrase spoken three years ago at manchester soldiers of the ploughshare as well as soldiers of the sword and they were all summed in a single sentence in the last volume of modern paintersgovernment and cooperation are in all things the laws of life anarchy and competition the laws of death  and with respect to the mode in which these general principles affect the secure possession of property so far am i from invalidating such security that the whole gist of these papers will be found ultimately to aim at an extension in its range and whereas it has long been known and declared that the poor have no right to the property of the rich i wish it also to be known and declared that the rich have no right to the property of the poor  but that the working of the system which i have undertaken to develop would in many ways shorten the apparent and direct though not the unseen and collateral power both of wealth as the lady of pleasure and of capital as the lord of toil i do not deny on the contrary i affirm it in all joyfulness knowing that the attraction of riches is already too strong as their authority is already too weighty for the reason of mankind i said in my last paper that nothing in history had ever been so disgraceful to human intellect as the acceptance among us of the common doctrines of political economy as a science i have many grounds for saying this but one of the chief may be given in few words i know no previous instance in history of a nations establishing a systematic disobedience to the first principles of its professed religion the writings which we verbally esteem as divine not only denounce the love of money as the source of all evil and as an idolatry abhorred of the deity but declare mammon service to be the accurate and irreconcileable opposite of gods service and whenever they speak of riches absolute and poverty absolute declare woe to the rich and blessing to the poor whereupon we forthwith investigate a science of becoming rich as the shortest road to national prosperity    tai cristian dannerà letiòpe   quando si partiranno i due collegi   luno in eterno ricco e laltro inÒpe     essay iv  ad valorem   in the last paper we saw that just payment of labour consisted in a sum of money which would approximately obtain equivalent labour at a future time we have now to examine the means of obtaining such equivalence which question involves the definition of value wealth price and produce  none of these terms are yet defined so as to be understood by the public but the last produce which one might have thought the clearest of all is in use the most ambiguous and the examination of the kind of ambiguity attendant on its present employment will best open the way to our work  in his chapter on capital44 mr j s mill instances as a capitalist a hardware manufacturer who having intended to spend a certain portion of the proceeds of his business in buying plate and jewels changes his mind and pays it as wages to additional workpeople the effect is stated by mr mill to be that more food is appropriated to the consumption of productive labourers     44 book i chap iv s 1 to save space my future references         to mr mills work will be by numerals only as in this         instance i iv 1 ed in 2 vols 8vo parker 1848  now i do not ask though had i written this paragraph it would surely have been asked of me what is to become of the silversmiths if they are truly unproductive persons we will acquiesce in their extinction and though in another part of the same passage the hardware merchant is supposed also to dispense with a number of servants whose food is thus set free for productive purposes i do not inquire what will be the effect painful or otherwise upon the servants of this emancipation of their food but i very seriously inquire why ironware is produce and silverware is not that the merchant consumes the one and sells the other certainly does not constitute the difference unless it can be shown which indeed i perceive it to be becoming daily more and more the aim of tradesmen to show that commodities are made to be sold and not to be consumed the merchant is an agent of conveyance to the consumer in one case and is himself the consumer in the other45 but the labourers are in either case equally productive since they have produced goods to the same value if the hardware and the plate are both goods     45 if mr mill had wished to show the difference in result         between consumption and sale he should have represented the         hardware merchant as consuming his own goods instead of         selling them similarly the silver merchant as consuming         his own goods instead of selling them had he done this he         would have made his position clearer though less tenable         and perhaps this was the position he really intended to         take tacitly involving his theory elsewhere stated and         shown in the sequel of this paper to be false that demand         for commodities is not demand for labour but by the most         diligent scrutiny of the paragraph now under examination i         cannot determine whether it is a fallacy pure and simple or         the half of one fallacy supported by the whole of a greater         one so that i treat it here on the kinder assumption that         it is one fallacy only  and what distinction separates them it is indeed possible that in the comparative estimate of the moralist with which mr mill says political economy has nothing to do iii i 2 a steel fork might appear a more substantial production than a silver one we may grant also that knives no less than forks are good produce and scythes and ploughshares serviceable articles but how of bayonets supposing the hardware merchant to effect large sales of these by help of the setting free of the food of his servants and his silversmithis he still employing productive labourers or in mr mills words labourers who increase the stock of permanent means of enjoyment i iii 4 or if instead of bayonets he supply bombs will not the absolute and final enjoyment of even these energetically productive articles each of which costs ten pounds46 be dependent on a proper choice of time and place for their enfantement choice that is to say depending on those philosophical considerations with which political economy has nothing to do47     46 i take mr afterwards sir a helps estimate in his essay         on war     47 also when the wrought silver vases of spain were dashed to         fragments by our customhouse officers because bullion         might be imported free of duty but not brains was the axe         that broke them productivethe artist who wrought them         unproductive or again if the woodmans axe is productive         is the executioners as also if the hemp of a cable be         productive does not the productiveness of hemp in a halter         depend on its moral more than on its material application  i should have regretted the need of pointing out inconsistency in any portion of mr mills work had not the value of his work proceeded from its inconsistencies he deserves honour among economists by inadvertently disclaiming the principles which he states and tacitly introducing the moral considerations with which he declares his science has no connection many of his chapters are therefore true and valuable and the only conclusions of his which i have to dispute are those which follow from his premises  thus the idea which lies at the root of the passage we have just been examining namely that labour applied to produce luxuries will not support so many persons as labour applied to produce useful articles is entirely true but the instance given failsand in four directions of failure at oncebecause mr mill has not defined the real meaning of usefulness the definition which he has givencapacity to satisfy a desire or serve a purpose iii i 2applies equally to the iron and silver while the true definitionwhich he has not given but which nevertheless underlies the false verbal definition in his mind and comes out once or twice by accident as in the words any support to life or strength in i i 5applies to some articles of iron but not to others and to some articles of silver but not to others it applies to ploughs but not to bayonets and to forks but not to filigree48     48 filigree that is to say generally ornament dependent         on complexity not on art  the eliciting of the true definition will give us the reply to our first question what is value respecting which however we must first hear the popular statements  the word value when used without adjunct always means in political economy value in exchange mill iii i 3 so that if two ships cannot exchange their rudders their rudders are in politicoeconomic language of no value to either  but the subject of political economy is wealthpreliminary remarks page 1  and wealth consists of all useful and agreeable objects which possess exchangeable valuepreliminary remarks page 10  it appears then according to mr mill that usefulness and agreeableness underlie the exchange value and must be ascertained to exist in the thing before we can esteem it an object of wealth  now the economical usefulness of a thing depends not merely on its own nature but on the number of people who can and will use it a horse is useless and therefore unsaleable if no one can ridea sword if no one can strike and meat if no one can eat thus every material utility depends on its relative human capacity  similarly the agreeableness of a thing depends not merely on its own likeableness but on the number of people who can be got to like it the relative agreeableness and therefore saleableness of a pot of the smallest ale and of adonis painted by a running brook depends virtually on the opinion of demos in the shape of christopher sly that is to say the agreeableness of a thing depends on its relative human disposition49 therefore political economy being a science of wealth must be a science respecting human capacities and dispositions but moral considerations have nothing to do with political economy iii i 2 therefore moral considerations have nothing to do with human capacities and dispositions     49 these statements sound crude in their brevity but will         be found of the utmost importance when they are developed         thus in the above instance economists have never perceived         that disposition to buy is a wholly moral element in         demand that is to say when you give a man halfacrown it         depends on his disposition whether he is rich or poor with         itwhether he will buy disease ruin and hatred or buy         health advancement and domestic love and thus the         agreeableness or exchange value of every offered commodity         depends on production not merely of the commodity but of         buyers of it therefore on the education of buyers and on         all the moral elements by which their disposition to buy         this or that is formed i will illustrate and expand into         final consequences every one of these definitions in its         place at present they can only be given with extremest         brevity for in order to put the subject at once in a         connected form before the reader i have thrown into one         the opening definitions of four chapters namely of that on         value ad valorem on price thirty pieces on         production demeter and on economy the law of the         house  i do not wholly like the look of this conclusion from mr mills statementslet us try mr ricardos  utility is not the measure of exchangeable value though it is absolutely essential to itchap 1 sect i essential to what degree mr ricardo there may be greater and less degrees of utility meat for instance may be so good as to be fit for any one to eat or so bad as to be fit for no one to eat what is the exact degree of goodness which is essential to its exchangeable value but not the measure of it how good must the meat be in order to possess any exchangeable value and how bad must it bei wish this were a settled question in london marketsin order to possess none  there appears to be some hitch i think in the working even of mr ricardos principles but let him take his own example suppose that in the early stages of society the bows and arrows of the hunter were of equal value with the implements of the fisherman under such circumstances the value of the deer the produce of the hunters days labour would be exactly italics mine equal to the value of the fish the product of the fishermans days labour the comparative value of the fish and game would be entirely regulated by the quantity of labour realized in each ricardo chap iii on value  indeed therefore if the fisherman catches one sprat and the huntsman one deer one sprat will be equal in value to one deer but if the fisherman catches no sprat and the huntsman two deer no sprat will be equal in value to two deer  nay butmr ricardos supporters may sayhe means on an averageif the average product of a days work of fisher and hunter be one fish and one deer the one fish will always be equal in value to the one deer  might i inquire the species of fish whale or whitebait50     50 perhaps it may be said in farther support of mr ricardo         that he meant when the utility is constant or given the         price varies as the quantity of labour if he meant this         he should have said it but had he meant it he could have         hardly missed the necessary result that utility would be         one measure of price which he expressly denies it to be         and that to prove saleableness he had to prove a given         quantity of utility as well as a given quantity of labour         to wit in his own instance that the deer and fish would         each feed the same number of men for the same number of         days with equal pleasure to their palates the fact is he         did not know what he meant himself the general idea which         he had derived from commercial experience without being         able to analyse it was that when the demand is constant         the price varies as the quantity of labour required for         production orusing the formula i gave in last         paperwhen y is constant xy varies as x but demand         never is nor can be ultimately constant if x varies         distinctly for as price rises consumers fall away and as         soon as there is a monopoly and all scarcity is a form of         monopoly so that every commodity is affected occasionally         by some colour of monopoly y becomes the most         influential condition of the price thus the price of a         painting depends less on its merit than on the interest         taken in it by the public the price of singing less on the         labour of the singer than the number of persons who desire         to hear him and the price of gold less on the scarcity         which affects it in common with cerium or iridium than on         the sunlight colour and unalterable purity by which it         attracts the admiration and answers the trust of mankind          it must be kept in mind however that i use the word         demand in a somewhat different sense from economists         usually they mean by it the quantity of a thing sold i         mean by it the force of the buyers capable intention to         buy in good english a persons demand signifies not         what he gets but what he asks for          economists also do not notice that objects are not valued by         absolute bulk or weight but by such bulk and weight as is         necessary to bring them into use they say for instance         that water bears no price in the market it is true that a         cupful does not but a lake does just as a handful of dust         does not but an acre does and were it possible to make         even the possession of the cupful or handful permanent         ie to find a place for them the earth and sea would         be bought up by handfuls and cupfuls  it would be waste of time to pursue these fallacies farther we will seek for a true definition  much store has been set for centuries upon the use of our english classical education it were to be wished that our welleducated merchants recalled to mind always this much of their latin schoolingthat the nominative of valorem a word already sufficiently familiar to them is valor a word which therefore ought to be familiar to them valor from valere to be well or strong greek hugiainôstrong in life if a man or valiant strong for life if a thing or valuable to be valuable therefore is to avail towards life a truly valuable or availing thing is that which leads to life with its whole strength in proportion as it does not lead to life or as its strength is broken it is less valuable in proportion as it leads away from life it is unvaluable or malignant  the value of a thing therefore is independent of opinion and of quantity think what you will of it gain how much you may of it the value of the thing itself is neither greater nor less for ever it avails or avails not no estimate can raise no disdain depress the power which it holds from the maker of things and of men  the real science of political economy which has yet to be distinguished from the bastard science as medicine from witchcraft and astronomy from astrology is that which teaches nations to desire and labour for the things that lead to life and which teaches them to scorn and destroy the things that lead to destruction and if in a state of infancy they suppose indifferent things such as excrescences of shellfish and pieces of blue and red stone to be valuable and spend large measure of the labour which ought to be employed for the extension and ennobling of life in diving or digging for them and cutting them into various shapesor if in the same state of infancy they imagine precious and beneficent things such as air light and cleanliness to be valuelessor if finally they imagine the conditions of their own existence by which alone they can truly possess or use anything such for instance as peace trust and love to be prudently exchangeable when the market offers for gold iron or excrescences of shellsthe great and only science of political economy teaches them in all these cases what is vanity and what substance and how the service of death the lord of waste and of eternal emptiness differs from the service of wisdom the lady of saving and of eternal fulness she who has said i will cause those that love me to inherit substance and i will fill their treasures  the lady of saving in a profounder sense than that of the savings bank though that is a good one madonna della salutelady of healthwhich though commonly spoken of as if separate from wealth is indeed a part of wealth this word wealth it will be remembered is the next we have to define  to be wealthy says mr mill is to have a large stock of useful articles  i accept this definition only let us perfectly understand it my opponents often lament my not giving them enough logic i fear i must at present use a little more than they will like but this business of political economy is no light one and we must allow no loose terms in it  we have therefore to ascertain in the above definition first what is the meaning of having or the nature of possession then what is the meaning of useful or the nature of utility  and first of possession at the crossing of the transepts of milan cathedral has lain for three hundred years the embalmed body of st carlo borromeo it holds a golden crosier and has a cross of emeralds on its breast admitting the crosier and emeralds to be useful articles is the body to be considered as having them do they in the politicoeconomical sense of property belong to it if not and if we may therefore conclude generally that a dead body cannot possess property what degree and period of animation in the body will render possession possible  as thus lately in a wreck of a californian ship one of the passengers fastened a belt about him with two hundred pounds of gold in it with which he was found afterwards at the bottom now as he was sinkinghad he the gold or had the gold him51     51 compare george herbert the church porch stanza 28  and if instead of sinking him in the sea by its weight the gold had struck him on the forehead and thereby caused incurable diseasesuppose palsy or insanitywould the gold in that case have been more a possession than in the first without pressing the inquiry up through instances of gradually increasing vital power over the gold which i will however give if they are asked for i presume the reader will see that possession or having is not an absolute but a gradated power and consists not only in the quantity or nature of the thing possessed but also and in a greater degree in its suitableness to the person possessing it and in his vital power to use it  and our definition of wealth expanded becomes the possession of useful articles which we can use this is a very serious change for wealth instead of depending merely on a have is thus seen to depend on a can gladiators death on a habet but soldiers victory and states salvation on a quo plurimum posset liv vii 6 and what we reasoned of only as accumulation of material is seen to demand also accumulation of capacity  so much for our verb next for our adjective what is the meaning of useful  the inquiry is closely connected with the last for what is capable of use in the hands of some persons is capable in the hands of others of the opposite of use called commonly fromuse or abuse and it depends on the person much more than on the article whether its usefulness or abusefulness will be the quality developed in it thus wine which the greeks in their bacchus made rightly the type of all passion and which when used cheereth god and man that is to say strengthens both the divine life or reasoning power and the earthly or carnal power of man yet when abused becomes dionusos hurtful especially to the divine part of man or reason and again the body itself being equally liable to use and to abuse and when rightly disciplined serviceable to the state both for war and labourbut when not disciplined or abused valueless to the state and capable only of continuing the private or single existence of the individual and that but feeblythe greeks called such a body an idiotic or private body from their word signifying a person employed in no way directly useful to the state whence finally our idiot meaning a person entirely occupied with his own concerns  hence it follows that if a thing is to be useful it must be not only of an availing nature but in availing hands or in accurate terms usefulness is value in the hands of the valiant so that this science of wealth being as we have just seen when regarded as the science of accumulation accumulative of capacity as well as of materialwhen regarded as the science of distribution is distribution not absolute but discriminate not of every thing to every man but of the right thing to the right man a difficult science dependent on more than arithmetic  wealth therefore is the possession of the valuable by the valiant and in considering it as a power existing in a nation the two elements the value of the thing and the valour of its possessor must be estimated together whence it appears that many of the persons commonly considered wealthy are in reality no more wealthy than the locks of their own strong boxes are they being inherently and eternally incapable of wealth and operating for the nation in an economical point of view either as pools of dead water and eddies in a stream which so long as the stream flows are useless or serve only to drown people but may become of importance in a state of stagnation should the stream dry or else as dams in a river of which the ultimate service depends not on the dam but the miller or else as mere accidental stays and impediments acting not as wealth but for we ought to have a correspondent term as illth causing various devastation and trouble around them in all directions or lastly act not at all but are merely animated conditions of delay no use being possible of anything they have until they are dead in which last condition they are nevertheless often useful as delays and impedimenta if a nation is apt to move too fast  this being so the difficulty of the true science of political economy lies not merely in the need of developing manly character to deal with material value but in the fact that while the manly character and material value only form wealth by their conjunction they have nevertheless a mutually destructive operation on each other for the manly character is apt to ignore or even cast away the material valuewhence that of pope    sure of qualities demanding praise   more go to ruin fortunes than to raise  and on the other hand the material value is apt to undermine the manly character so that it must be our work in the issue to examine what evidence there is of the effect of wealth on the minds of its possessors also what kind of person it is who usually sets himself to obtain wealth and succeeds in doing so and whether the world owes more gratitude to rich or to poor men either for their moral influence upon it or for chief goods discoveries and practical advancements i may however anticipate future conclusions so far as to state that in a community regulated only by laws of demand and supply but protected from open violence the persons who become rich are generally speaking industrious resolute proud covetous prompt methodical sensible unimaginative insensitive and ignorant the persons who remain poor are the entirely foolish the entirely wise52 the idle the reckless the humble the thoughtful the dull the imaginative the sensitive the wellinformed the improvident the irregularly and impulsively wicked the clumsy knave the open thief and the entirely merciful just and godly person     52 greek ho zeus dêpou penetaiarist plut 582 it         would but weaken the grand words to lean on the preceding         onesgreek hoti tou ploutou parecho beltionas andras         kai ten gnomen kai ten idean  thus far then of wealth next we have to ascertain the nature of price that is to say of exchange value and its expression by currencies  note first of exchange there can be no profit in it it is only in labour there can be profitthat is to say a making in advance or making in favour of from proficio in exchange there is only advantage ie a bringing of vantage or power to the exchanging persons thus one man by sowing and reaping turns one measure of corn into two measures that is profit another by digging and forging turns one spade into two spades that is profit but the man who has two measures of corn wants sometimes to dig and the man who has two spades wants sometimes to eatthey exchange the gained grain for the gained tool and both are the better for the exchange but though there is much advantage in the transaction there is no profit nothing is constructed or produced only that which had been before constructed is given to the person by whom it can be used if labour is necessary to effect the exchange that labour is in reality involved in the production and like all other labour bears profit whatever number of men are concerned in the manufacture or in the conveyance have share in the profit but neither the manufacture nor the conveyance are the exchange and in the exchange itself there is no profit  there may however be acquisition which is a very different thing if in the exchange one man is able to give what cost him little labour for what has cost the other much he acquires a certain quantity of the produce of the others labour and precisely what he acquires the other loses in mercantile language the person who thus acquires is commonly said to have made a profit and i believe that many of our merchants are seriously under the impression that it is possible for everybody somehow to make a profit in this manner whereas by the unfortunate constitution of the world we live in the laws both of matter and motion have quite rigorously forbidden universal acquisition of this kind profit or material gain is attainable only by construction or by discovery not by exchange whenever material gain follows exchange for every plus there is a precisely equal minus  unhappily for the progress of the science of political economy the plus quantities orif i may be allowed to coin an awkward pluralthe pluses make a very positive and venerable appearance in the world so that every one is eager to learn the science which produces results so magnificent whereas the minuses have on the other hand a tendency to retire into back streets and other places of shadeor even to get themselves wholly and finally put out of sight in graves which renders the algebra of this science peculiar and difficultly legible a large number of its negative signs being written by the accountkeeper in a kind of red ink which starvation thins and makes strangely pale or even quite invisible ink for the present  the science of exchange or as i hear it has been proposed to call it of catallactics considered as one of gain is therefore simply nugatory but considered as one of acquisition it is a very curious science differing in its data and basis from every other science known thusif i can exchange a needle with a savage for a diamond my power of doing so depends either on the savages ignorance of social arrangements in europe or on his want of power to take advantage of them by selling the diamond to any one else for more needles if farther i make the bargain as completely advantageous to myself as possible by giving to the savage a needle with no eye in it reaching thus a sufficiently satisfactory type of the perfect operation of catallactic science the advantage to me in the entire transaction depends wholly upon the ignorance powerlessness or heedlessness of the person dealt with do away with these and catallactic advantage becomes impossible so far therefore as the science of exchange relates to the advantage of one of the exchanging persons only it is founded on the ignorance or incapacity of the opposite person where these vanish it also vanishes it is therefore a science founded on nescience and an art founded on artlessness but all other sciences and arts except this have for their object the doing away with their opposite nescience and artlessness this science alone of sciences must by all available means promulgate and prolong its opposite nescience otherwise the science itself is impossible it is therefore peculiarly and alone the science of darkness probably a bastard sciencenot by any means a divina scientia but one begotten of another father that father who advising his children to turn stones into bread is himself employed in turning bread into stones and who if you ask a fish of him fish not being producible on his estate can but give you a serpent  the general law then respecting just or economical exchange is simply thisthere must be advantage on both sides or if only advantage on one at least no disadvantage on the other to the persons exchanging and just payment for his time intelligence and labour to any intermediate person effecting the transaction commonly called a merchant and whatever advantage there is on either side and whatever pay is given to the intermediate person should be thoroughly known to all concerned all attempt at concealment implies some practice of the opposite or undivine science founded on nescience whence another saying of the jew merchantsas a nail between the stone joints so doth sin stick fast between buying and selling which peculiar riveting of stone and timber in mens dealing with each other is again set forth in

for its lid and the woman the spirit of wickedness within itthat is to say wickedness hidden by dulness and formalized outwardly into ponderously established cruelty it shall be set upon its own base in the land on babel53     53 zech v 11 see note on the passage at pp 1912  i have hitherto carefully restricted myself in speaking of exchange to the use of the term advantage but that term includes two ideas the advantage namely of getting what we need and that of getting what we wish for threefourths of the demands existing in the world are romantic founded on visions idealisms hopes and affections and the regulation of the purse is in its essence regulation of the imagination and the heart hence the right discussion of the nature of price is a very high metaphysical and psychical problem sometimes to be solved only in a passionate manner as by david in his counting the price of the water of the well by the gate of bethlehem but its first conditions are the followingthe price of anything is the quantity of labour given by the person desiring it in order to obtain possession of it this price depends on four variable quantities a the quantity of wish the purchaser has for the thing opposed to greek a the quantity of wish the seller has to keep it b the quantity of labour the purchaser can afford to obtain the thing opposed to greek b the quantity of labour the seller can afford to keep it these quantities are operative only in excess ie the quantity of wish a means the quantity of wish for this thing above wish for other things and the quantity of work b means the quantity which can be spared to get this thing from the quantity needed to get other things  phenomena of price therefore are intensely complex curious and interestingtoo complex however to be examined yet every one of them when traced far enough showing itself at last as a part of the bargain of the poor of the flock or flock of slaughter if ye think good give me my price and if not forbearzech xi 12 but as the price of everything is to be calculated finally in labour it is necessary to define the nature of that standard  labour is the contest of the life of man with an oppositethe term life including his intellect soul and physical power contending with question difficulty trial or material force  labour is of a higher or lower order as it includes more or fewer of the elements of life and labour of good quality in any kind includes always as much intellect and feeling as will fully and harmoniously regulate the physical force  in speaking of the value and price of labour it is necessary always to understand labour of a given rank and quality as we should speak of gold or silver of a given standard bad that is heartless inexperienced or senseless labour cannot be valued it is like gold of uncertain alloy or flawed iron54     54 labour which is entirely good of its kind that is to say         effective or efficient the greeks called weighable         or greek axios translated usually worthy and         because thus substantial and true they called its price         greek timê the honourable estimate of it honorarium         this word being founded on their conception of true labour         as a divine thing to be honoured with the kind of honour         given to the gods whereas the price of false labour or of         that which led away from life was to be not honour but         vengeance for which they reserved another word attributing         the exaction of such price to a peculiar goddess called         tisiphone the requiter or quittancetaker of death         a person versed in the highest branches of arithmetic and         punctual in her habits with whom accounts current have been         opened also in modern days  the quality and kind of labour being given its value like that of all other valuable things is invariable but the quantity of it which must be given for other things is variable and in estimating this variation the price of other things must always be counted by the quantity of labour not the price of labour by the quantity of other things  thus if we want to plant an apple sapling in rocky ground it may take two hours work in soft ground perhaps only half an hour grant the soil equally good for the tree in each case then the value of the sapling planted by two hours work is nowise greater than that of the sapling planted in half an hour one will bear no more fruit than the other also one halfhour of work is as valuable as another halfhour nevertheless the one sapling has cost four such pieces of work the other only one now the proper statement of this fact is not that the labour on the hard ground is cheaper than on the soft but that the tree is dearer the exchange value may or may not afterwards depend on this fact if other people have plenty of soft ground to plant in they will take no cognizance of our two hours labour in the price they will offer for the plant on the rock and if through want of sufficient botanical science we have planted an upastree instead of an apple the exchange value will be a negative quantity still less proportionate to the labour expended  what is commonly called cheapness of labour signifies therefore in reality that many obstacles have to be overcome by it so that much labour is required to produce a small result but this should never be spoken of as cheapness of labour but as dearness of the object wrought for it would be just as rational to say that walking was cheap because we had ten miles to walk home to our dinner as that labour was cheap because we had to work ten hours to earn it  the last word which we have to define is production  i have hitherto spoken of all labour as profitable because it is impossible to consider under one head the quality or value of labour and its aim but labour of the best quality may be various in aim it may be either constructive gathering from con and struo as agriculture nugatory as jewelcutting or destructive scattering from de and struo as war it is not however always easy to prove labour apparently nugatory to be actually so55 generally the formula holds good he that gathereth not scattereth thus the jewellers art is probably very harmful in its ministering to a clumsy and inelegant pride so that finally i believe nearly all labour may be shortly divided into positive and negative labour positive that which produces life negative that which produces death the most directly negative labour being murder and the most directly positive the bearing and rearing of children so that in the precise degree in which murder is hateful on the negative side of idleness in that exact degree childrearing is admirable on the positive side of idleness for which reason and because of the honour that there is in rearing56 children while the wife is said to be as the vine for cheering the children are as the olivebranch for praise nor for praise only but for peace because large families can only be reared in times of peace though since in their spreading and voyaging in various directions they distribute strength they are to the home strength as arrows in the hand of the giantstriking here and there far away     55 the most accurately nugatory labour is perhaps that of         which not enough is given to answer a purpose effectually         and which therefore has all to be done over again also         labour which fails of effect through noncooperation the         curé of a little village near bellinzona to whom i had         expressed wonder that the peasants allowed the ticino to         flood their fields told me that they would not join to         build an effectual embankment high up the valley because         everybody said that would help his neighbours as much as         himself so every proprietor built a bit of low embankment         about his own field and the ticino as soon as it had a         mind swept away and swallowed all up together     56 observe i say rearing not begetting the praise is         in the seventh season not in greek sporêtos nor in         greek phytalia but in greek opôra it is strange         that men always praise enthusiastically any person who         by a momentary exertion saves a life but praise very         hesitatingly a person who by exertion and selfdenial         prolonged through years creates one we give the crown ob         civem servatumwhy not ob civem natum born i mean to         the full in soul as well as body england has oak enough i         think for both chaplets  labour being thus various in its result the prosperity of any nation is in exact proportion to the quantity of labour which it spends in obtaining and employing means of life observei say obtaining and employing that is to say not merely wisely producing but wisely distributing and consuming economists usually speak as if there were no good in consumption absolute57 so far from this being so consumption absolute is the end crown and perfection of production and wise consumption is a far more difficult art than wise production twenty people can gain money for one who can use it and the vital question for individual and for nation is never how much do they make but to what purpose do they spend     57 when mr mill speaks of productive consumption he only         means consumption which results in increase of capital or         material wealth see i iii 4 and i iii 5  the reader may perhaps have been surprised at the slight reference i have hitherto made to capital and its functions it is here the place to define them  capital signifies head or source or root materialit is material by which some derivative or secondary good is produced it is only capital proper caput vivum not caput mortuum when it is thus producing something different from itself it is a root which does not enter into vital function till it produces something else than a root namely fruit that fruit will in time again produce roots and so all living capital issues in reproduction of capital but capital which produces nothing but capital is only root producing root bulb issuing in bulb never in tulip seed issuing in seed never in bread the political economy of europe has hitherto devoted itself wholly to the multiplication or less even the aggregation of bulbs it never saw nor conceived such a thing as a tulip nay boiled bulbs they might have beenglass bulbsprince ruperts drops consummated in powder well if it were glasspowder and not gunpowder for any end or meaning the economists had in defining the laws of aggregation we will try and get a clearer notion of them  the best and simplest general type of capital is a wellmade ploughshare now if that ploughshare did nothing but beget other ploughshares in a polypous mannerhowever the great cluster of polypous plough might glitter in the sun it would have lost its function of capital it becomes true capital only by another kind of splendourwhen it is seen splendescere sulco to grow bright in the furrow rather with diminution of its substance than addition by the noble friction and the true home question to every capitalist and to every nation is not how many ploughs have you but where are your furrows nothow quickly will this capital reproduce itselfbut what will it do during reproduction what substance will it furnish good for life what work construct protective of life if none its own reproduction is uselessif worse than none for capital may destroy life as well as support it its own reproduction is worse than useless it is merely an advance from tisiphone on mortgagenot a profit by any means  not a profit as the ancients truly saw and showed in the type of ixionfor capital is the head or fountain head of wealththe wellhead of wealth as the clouds are the wellheads of rain but when clouds are without water and only beget clouds they issue in wrath at last instead of rain and in lightning instead of harvest whence ixion is said first to have invited his guests to a banquet and then made them fall into a pit filled with fire which is the type of the temptation of riches issuing in imprisoned tormenttorment in a pit as also demas silver mine after which to show the rage of riches passing from lust of pleasure to lust of power yet power not truly understood ixion is said to have desired juno and instead embracing a cloud or phantasm to have begotten the centaurs the power of mere wealth being in itself as the embrace of a shadowcomfortless so also ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind or that which is notprov xxiii 5 and again dantes geryon the type of avaricious fraud as he flies gathers the air up with retractile clawslaer a se raccolse58 but in its offspring a mingling of the brutal with the human nature human in sagacityusing both intellect and arrow but brutal in its body and hoof for consuming and trampling down for which sin ixion is at last bound upon a wheelfiery and toothed and rolling perpetually in the airthe type of human labour when selfish and fruitless kept far into the middle ages in their wheel of fortune the wheel which has in it no breath or spirit but is whirled by chance only whereas of all true work the ezekiel vision is true that the spirit of the living creature is in the wheels and where the angels go the wheels go by them but move no otherwise     58 so also in the vision of the women bearing the ephah before         quoted the wind was in their wings not wings of a         stork as in our version but milvi of a kite in the         vulgate or perhaps more accurately still in the septuagint         hoopoe a bird connected typically with the power of         riches by many traditions of which that of its petition for         a crest of gold is perhaps the most interesting the birds         of aristophanes in which its part is principal is full of         them note especially the fortification of the air with         baked bricks like babylon l 550 and again compare the         plutus of dante who to show the influence of riches in         destroying the reason is the only one of the powers of the         inferno who cannot speak intelligibly and also the         cowardliest he is not merely quelled or restrained but         literally collapses at a word the sudden and helpless         operation of mercantile panic being all told in the brief         metaphor as the sails swollen with the wind fall when         the mast breaks  this being the real nature of capital it follows that there are two kinds of true production always going on in an active state one of seed and one of food or production for the ground and for the mouth both of which are by covetous persons thought to be production only for the granary whereas the function of the granary is but intermediate and conservative fulfilled in distribution else it ends in nothing but mildew and nourishment of rats and worms and since production for the ground is only useful with future hope of harvest all essential production is for the mouth and is finally measured by the mouth hence as i said above consumption is the crown of production and the wealth of a nation is only to be estimated by what it consumes  the want of any clear sight of this fact is the capital error issuing in rich interest and revenue of error among the political economists their minds are continually set on moneygain not on mouthgain and they fall into every sort of net and snare dazzled by the coinglitter as birds by the fowlers glass or rather for there is not much else like birds in them they are like children trying to jump on the heads of their own shadows the moneygain being only the shadow of the true gain which is humanity  the final object of political economy therefore is to get good method of consumption and great quantity of consumption in other words to use everything and to use it nobly whether it be substance service or service perfecting substance the most curious error in mr mills entire work provided for him originally by ricardo is his endeavour to distinguish between direct and indirect service and consequent assertion that a demand for commodities is not demand for labour i v 9 et seq he distinguishes between labourers employed to lay out pleasure grounds and to manufacture velvet declaring that it makes material difference to the labouring classes in which of these two ways a capitalist spends his money because the employment of the gardeners is a demand for labour but the purchase of velvet is not59 error colossal as well as strange it will indeed make a difference to the labourer whether we bid him swing his scythe in the spring winds or drive the loom in pestilential air but so far as his pocket is concerned it makes to him absolutely no difference whether we order him to make green velvet with seed and a scythe or red velvet with silk and scissors neither does it anywise concern him whether when the velvet is made we consume it by walking on it or wearing it so long as our consumption of it is wholly selfish but if our consumption is to be in any wise unselfish not only our mode of consuming the articles we require interests him but also the kind of article we require with a view to consumption as thus returning for a moment to mr mills great hardware theory60 it matters so far as the labourers immediate profit is concerned not an iron filing whether i employ him in growing a peach or forging a bombshell but my probable mode of consumption of those articles matters seriously admit that it is to be in both cases unselfish and the difference to him is final whether when his child is ill i walk into his cottage and give it the peach or drop the shell down his chimney and blow his roof off     59 the value of raw material which has indeed to be deducted         from the price of the labour is not contemplated in the         passages referred to mr mill having fallen into the         mistake solely by pursuing the collateral results of the         payment of wages to middlemen he saysthe consumer does         not with his own funds pay the weaver for his days work         pardon me the consumer of the velvet pays the weaver with         his own funds as much as he pays the gardener he pays         probably an intermediate shipowner velvet merchant and         shopman pays carriage money shop rent damage money time         money and care money all these are above and beside the         velvet price just as the wages of a head gardener would be         above the grass price but the velvet is as much produced         by the consumers capital though he does not pay for it         till six months after production as the grass is produced         by his capital though he does not pay the man who mowed and         rolled it on monday till saturday afternoon i do not know         if mr mills conclusionthe capital cannot be dispensed         with the purchasers canhas yet been reduced to practice         in the city on any large scale     60 which observe is the precise opposite of the one         under examination the hardware theory required us to         discharge our gardeners and engage manufacturers the velvet         theory requires us to discharge our manufacturers and engage         gardeners  the worst of it for the peasant is that the capitalists consumption of the peach is apt to be selfish and of the shell distributive61 but in all cases this is the broad and general fact that on due catallactic commercial principles somebodys roof must go off in fulfilment of the bombs destiny you may grow for your neighbour at your liking grapes or grapeshot he will also catallactically grow grapes or grapeshot for you and you will each reap what you have sown     61 it is one very awful form of the operation of wealth in         europe that it is entirely capitalists wealth which         supports unjust wars just wars do not need so much money to         support them for most of the men who wage such wage them         gratis but for an unjust war mens bodies and souls have         both to be bought and the best tools of war for them         besides which makes such war costly to the maximum not to         speak of the cost of base fear and angry suspicion between         nations which have not grace nor honesty enough in all their         multitudes to buy an hours peace of mind with as at         present france and england purchasing of each other ten         millions sterling worth of consternation annually a         remarkably light crop half thorns and half aspen         leavessown reaped and granaried by the science of the         modern political economist teaching covetousness instead of         truth and all unjust war being supportable if not by         pillage of the enemy only by loans from capitalists these         loans are repaid by subsequent taxation of the people who         appear to have no will in the matter the capitalists will         being the primary root of the war but its real root is the         covetousness of the whole nation rendering it incapable of         faith frankness or justice and bringing about therefore         in due time his own separate loss and punishment to each         person  it is therefore the manner and issue of consumption which are the real tests of production production does not consist in things laboriously made but in things serviceably consumable and the question for the nation is not how much labour it employs but how much life it produces for as consumption is the end and aim of production so life is the end and aim of consumption  i left this question to the readers thought two months ago choosing rather that he should work it out for himself than have it sharply stated to him but now the ground being sufficiently broken and the details into which the several questions here opened must lead us being too complex for discussion in the pages of a periodical so that i must pursue them elsewhere i desire in closing the series of introductory papers to leave this one great fact clearly stated there is no wealth but life life including all its powers of love of joy and of admiration that country is the richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings that man is richest who having perfected the functions of his own life to the utmost has also the widest helpful influence both personal and by means of his possessions over the lives of others  a strange political economy the only one nevertheless that ever was or can be all political economy founded on selfinterest62 being but the fulfilment of that which once brought schism into the policy of angels and ruin into the economy of heaven     62 in all reasoning about prices the proviso must be         understood supposing all parties to take care of their         own interestmill iii i 5  the greatest number of human beings noble and happy but is the nobleness consistent with the number yes not only consistent with it but essential to it the maximum of life can only be reached by the maximum of virtue in this respect the law of human population differs wholly from that of animal life the multiplication of animals is checked only by want of food and by the hostility of races the population of the gnat is restrained by the hunger of the swallow and that of the swallow by the scarcity of gnats man considered as an animal is indeed limited by the same laws hunger or plague or war are the necessary and only restraints upon his increaseeffectual restraints hithertohis principal study having been how most swiftly to destroy himself or ravage his dwellingplaces and his highest skill directed to give range to the famine seed to the plague and sway to the sword but considered as other than an animal his increase is not limited by these laws it is limited only by the limits of his courage and his love both of these have their bounds and ought to have his race has its bounds also but these have not yet been reached nor will be reached for ages  in all the ranges of human thought i know none so melancholy as the speculations of political economists on the population question it is proposed to better the condition of the labourer by giving him higher wages nay says the economist if you raise his wages he will either drag people down to the same point of misery at which you found him or drink your wages away he will i know it who gave him this will suppose it were your own son of whom you spoke declaring to me that you dared not take him into your firm nor even give him his just labourers wages because if you did he would die of drunkenness and leave half a score of children to the parish who gave your son these dispositionsi should inquire has he them by inheritance or by education by one or other they must come and as in him so also in the poor either these poor are of a race essentially different from ours and unredeemable which however often implied i have heard none yet openly say or else by such care as we have ourselves received we may make them continent and sober as ourselveswise and dispassionate as we aremodels arduous of imitation but it is answered they cannot receive education why not that is precisely the point at issue charitable persons suppose the worst fault of the rich is to refuse the people meat and the people cry for their meat kept back by fraud to the lord of multitudes63 alas it is not meat of which the refusal is cruelest or to which the claim is validest the life is more than the meat the rich not only refuse food to the poor they refuse wisdom they refuse virtue they refuse salvation ye sheep without shepherd it is not the pasture that has been shut from you but the presence meat perhaps your right to that may be pleadable but other rights have to be pleaded first claim your crumbs from the table if you will but claim them as children not as dogs claim your right to be fed but claim more loudly your right to be holy perfect and pure     63 james v 4 observe in these statements i am not taking         up nor countenancing one whit the common socialist idea of         division of property division of property is its         destruction and with it the destruction of all hope all         industry and all justice it is simply chaosa chaos         towards which the believers in modern political economy are         fast tending and from which i am striving to save them the         rich man does not keep back meat from the poor by retaining         his riches but by basely using them riches are a form of         strength and a strong man does not injure others by keeping         his strength but by using it injuriously the socialist         seeing a strong man oppress a weak one cries outbreak         the strong mans arms but i say teach him to use them to         better purpose the fortitude and intelligence which         acquire riches are intended by the giver of both not to         scatter nor to give away but to employ those riches in the         service of mankind in other words in the redemption of the         erring and aid of the weakthat is to say there is first         to be the work to gain money then the sabbath of use for         itthe sabbath whose law is not to lose life but to         save it is continually the fault or the folly of the poor         that they are poor as it is usually a childs fault if it         falls into a pond and a cripples weakness that slips at a         crossing nevertheless most passersby would pull the child         out or help up the cripple put it at the worst that all         the poor of the world are but disobedient children or         careless cripples and that all rich people are wise and         strong and you will see at once that neither is the         socialist right in desiring to make everybody poor         powerless and foolish as he is himself nor the rich man         right in leaving the children in the mire  strange words to be used of working people what holy without any long robes nor anointing oils these roughjacketed roughworded persons set to nameless and dishonoured service perfectthese with dim eyes and cramped limbs and slowly wakening minds purethese with sensual desire and grovelling thought foul of body and coarse of soul it may be so nevertheless such as they are they are the holiest perfectest purest persons the earth can at present show they may be what you have said but if so they yet are holier than we who have left them thus  but what can be done for them who can clothewho teachwho restrain their multitudes what end can there be for them at last but to consume one another  i hope for another end though not indeed from any of the three remedies for overpopulation commonly suggested by economists  these three are in briefcolonization bringing in of waste lands or discouragement of marriage  the first and second of these expedients merely evade or delay the question it will indeed be long before the world has been all colonized and its deserts all brought under cultivation but the radical question is not how much habitable land is in the world but how many human beings ought to be maintained on a given space of habitable land  observe i say ought to be not how many can be ricardo with his usual inaccuracy defines what he calls the natural rate of wages as that which will maintain the labourer maintain him yes but howthe question was instantly thus asked of me by a working girl to whom i read the passage i will amplify her question for her maintain him how as first to what length of life out of a given number of fed persons how many are to be oldhow many young that is to say will you arrange their maintenance so as to kill them earlysay at thirty or thirtyfive on the average including deaths of weakly or illfed childrenor so as to enable them to live out a natural life you will feed a greater number in the first case64 by rapidity of succession probably a happier number in the second which does mr ricardo mean to be their natural state and to which state belongs the natural rate of wages     64 the quantity of life is the same in both cases but it         is differently allotted  again a piece of land which will only support ten idle ignorant and improvident persons will support thirty or forty intelligent and industrious ones which of these is their natural state and to which of them belongs the natural rate of wages  again if a piece of land support forty persons in industrious ignorance and if tired of this ignorance they set apart ten of their number to study the properties of cones and the sizes of stars the labour of these ten being withdrawn from the ground must either tend to the increase of food in some transitional manner or the persons set apart for sidereal and conic purposes must starve or some one else starve instead of them what is therefore the natural rate of wages of the scientific persons and how does this rate relate to or measure their reverted or transitional productiveness  again if the ground maintains at first forty labourers in a peaceable and pious state of mind but they become in a few years so quarrelsome and impious that they have to set apart five to meditate upon and settle their disputes ten armed to the teeth with costly instruments to enforce the decisions and five to remind everybody in an eloquent manner of the existence of a godwhat will be the result upon the general power of production and what is the natural rate of wages of the meditative muscular and oracular labourers  leaving these questions to be discussed or waived at their pleasure by mr ricardos followers i proceed to state the main facts bearing on that probable future of the labouring classes which has been partially glanced at by mr mill that chapter and the preceding one differ from the common writing of political economists in admitting some value in the aspect of nature and expressing regret at the probability of the destruction of natural scenery but we may spare our anxieties on this head men can neither drink steam nor eat stone the maximum of population on a given space of land implies also the relative maximum of edible vegetable whether for men or cattle it implies a maximum of pure air and of pure water therefore a maximum of wood to transmute the air and of sloping ground protected by herbage from the extreme heat of the sun to feed the streams all england may if it so chooses become one manufacturing town and englishmen sacrificing themselves to the good of general humanity may live diminished lives in the midst of noise of darkness and of deadly exhalation but the world cannot become a factory nor a mine no amount of ingenuity will ever make iron digestible by the million nor substitute hydrogen for wine neither the avarice nor the rage of men will ever feed them and however the apple of sodom and the grape of gomorrah may spread their table for a time with dainties of ashes and nectar of aspsso long as men live by bread the far away valleys must laugh as they are covered with the gold of god and the shouts of his happy multitudes ring round the winepress and the well  nor need our more sentimental economists fear the too wide spread of the formalities of a mechanical agriculture the presence of a wise population implies the search for felicity as well as for food nor can any population reach its maximum but through that wisdom which rejoices in the habitable parts of the earth the desert has its appointed place and work the eternal engine whose beam is the earths axle whose beat is its year and whose breath is its ocean will still divide imperiously to their desert kingdoms bound with unfurrowable rock and swept by unarrested sand their powers of frost and fire but the zones and lands between habitable will be loveliest in habitation the desire of the heart is also the light of the eyes no scene is continually and untiringly loved but one rich by joyful human labour smooth in field fair in garden full in orchard trim sweet and frequent in homestead ringing with voices of vivid existence no air is sweet that is silent it is only sweet when full of low currents of under soundtriplets of birds and murmur and chirp of insects and deeptoned words of men and wayward trebles of childhood as the art of life is learned it will be found at last that all lovely things are also necessarythe wild flower by the wayside as well as the tended corn and the wild birds and creatures of the forest as well as the tended cattle because man doth not live by bread only but also by the desert manna by every wondrous word and unknowable work of god happy in that he knew them not nor did his fathers know and that round about him reaches yet into the infinite the amazement of his existence  note finally that all effectual advancement towards this true felicity of the human race must be by individual not public effort certain general measures may aid certain revised laws guide such advancement but the measure and law which have first to be determined are those of each mans home we continually hear it recommended by sagacious people to complaining neighbours usually less well placed in the world than themselves that they should remain content in the station in which providence has placed them there are perhaps some circumstances of life in which providence has no intention that people should be content nevertheless the maxim is on the whole a good one but it is peculiarly for home use that your neighbour should or should not remain content with his position is not your business but it is very much your business to remain content with your own what is chiefly needed in england at the present day is to show the quantity of pleasure that may be obtained by a consistent welladministered competence modest confessed and laborious we need examples of people who leaving heaven to decide whether they are to rise in the world decide for themselves that they will be happy in it and have resolved to seeknot greater wealth but simpler pleasure not higher fortune but deeper felicity making the first of possessions selfpossession and honouring themselves in the harmless pride and calm pursuits of peace  of which lowly peace it is written that justice and peace have kissed each other and that the fruit of justice is sown in peace of them that make peace not peacemakers in the common understandingreconcilers of quarrels though that function also follows on the greater one but peacecreators givers of calm which you cannot give unless you first gain nor is this gain one which will follow assuredly on any course of business commonly so called no form of gain is less probable business being as is shown in the

pillars and even when though apt to wait long at the doorposts she has to leave her house and go abroad her paths are peace also  for us at all events her work must begin at the entry of the doors all true economy is law of the house strive to make that law strict simple generous waste nothing and grudge nothing care in nowise to make more of money but care to make much of it remembering always the great palpable inevitable factthe rule and root of all economythat what one person has another cannot have and that every atom of substance of whatever kind used or consumed is so much human life spent which if it issue in the saving present life or gaining more is well spent but if not is either so much life prevented or so much slain in all buying consider first what condition of existence you cause in the producers of what you buy secondly whether the sum you have paid is just to the producer and in due proportion lodged in his hands65 thirdly to how much clear use for food knowledge or joy this that you have bought can be put and fourthly to whom and in what way it can be most speedily and serviceably distributed in all dealings whatsoever insisting on entire openness and stern

offices of middlemen namely overseers or         authoritative workmen conveyancers merchants sailors         retail dealers etc and ordertakers persons employed to         receive directions from the consumer must of course be         examined before i can enter farther into the question of         just payment of the first producer but i have not spoken         of them in these introductory papers because the evils         attendant on the abuse of such intermediate functions result         not from any alleged principle of modern political economy         but from private carelessness or iniquity  and if on due and honest thought over these things it seems that the kind of existence to which men are now summoned by every plea of pity and claim of right may for some time at least not be a luxurious oneconsider whether even supposing it guiltless luxury would be desired by any of us if we saw clearly at our sides the suffering which accompanies it in the world luxury is indeed possible in the futureinnocent and exquisite luxury for all and by the help of all but luxury at present can only be enjoyed by the ignorant the cruelest man living could not sit at his feast unless

contributed to frasers magazine in 1862 and 1863 being a sequel to papers which appeared in the cornhill magazine under the title of unto this last     i  maintenance of life wealth money and riches   as domestic economy regulates the acts and habits of a household political economy regulates those of a society or state with reference to its maintenance  political economy is neither an art nor a science66 but a system of conduct and legislature founded on the sciences directing the arts and impossible except under certain conditions of moral culture  by the maintenance of a state is to be understood the support of its population in healthy and happy life and the increase of their numbers so far as that increase is consistent with their happiness it is not the object of political economy to increase the numbers of a nation at the cost of common health or comfort nor to increase indefinitely the comfort of individuals by sacrifice of surrounding lives or possibilities of life     66 the science which in modern days had been called political         economy is in reality nothing more than the investigation of         the phenomena of commercial operations it has no connexion         with political economy as understood and treated of by the         great thinkers of past ages and as long as it is allowed         to pass under the same name every word written by those         thinkersand chiefly the words of plato xenophon cicero         and baconmust be either misunderstood or misapplied the         reader must not therefore be surprised at the care and         insistence with which i have retained the literal and earliest         sense of all important terms used in these papers for a word         is usually well made at the time it is first wanted its         youngest meaning has in it the full strength of its youth         subsequent senses are commonly warped or weakened and as a         misused word always is liable to involve an obscured thought         and all careful thinkers either on this or any other subject         are sure to have used their words accurately the first         condition in order to be able to avail ourselves of their         sayings at all is a firm definition of terms  the assumption which lies at the root of nearly all erroneous reasoning on political economynamely that its object is to accumulate money or exchangeable propertymay be shown in few words to be without foundation for no economist would admit national economy to be legitimate which proposed to itself only the building of a pyramid of gold he would declare the gold to be wasted were it to remain in the monumental form and would say it ought to be employed but to what end either it must be used only to gain more gold and build a larger pyramid or to some purpose other than the gaining of gold and this other purpose however at first apprehended will be found to resolve itself finally into the service of manthat is to say the extension defence or comfort of his life the golden pyramid may perhaps be providently built perhaps improvidently but at all events the wisdom or folly of the accumulation can only be determined by our having first clearly stated the aim of all economy namely the extension of life  if the accumulation of money or of exchangeable property were a certain means of extending existence it would be useless in discussing economical questions to fix our attention upon the more distant objectlifeinstead of the immediate onemoney but it is not so money may sometimes be accumulated at the cost of life or by limitations of it that is to say either by hastening the deaths of men or preventing their births it is therefore necessary to keep clearly in view the ultimate object of economy and to determine the expediency of minor operations with reference to that ulterior end it has been just stated that the object of political economy is the continuance not only of life but of healthy and happy life but all true happiness is both a consequence and cause of life it is a sign of its vigour and means of its continuance all true suffering is in like manner a consequence and cause of death i shall therefore in future use the word life singly but let it be understood to include in its signification the happiness and power of the entire human nature body and soul  that human nature as its creator made it and maintains it wherever his laws are observed is entirely harmonious no physical error can be more profound no moral error more dangerous than that involved in the monkish doctrine of the opposition of body to soul no soul can be perfect in an imperfect body no body perfect without perfect soul every right action and true thought sets the seal of its beauty on person and face every wrong action and foul thought its seal of distortion and the various aspects of humanity might be read as plainly as a printed history were it not that the impressions are so complex that it must always in some casesand in the present state of our knowledge in all casesbe impossible to decipher them completely nevertheless the face of a consistently just and of a consistently unjust person may always be rightly discerned at a glance and if the qualities are continued by descent through a generation or two there arises a complete distinction of race both moral and physical qualities are communicated by descent far more than they can be developed by education though both may be destroyed for want of education and there is as yet no ascertained limit to the nobleness of person and mind which the human creature may attain by persevering observance of the laws of god respecting its birth and training we must therefore yet farther define the aim of political economy to be the multiplication of human life at the highest standard it might at first seem questionable whether we should endeavour to maintain a small number of persons of the highest type of beauty and intelligence or a larger number of an inferior class but i shall be able to show in the sequel that the way to maintain the largest number is first to aim at the highest standard determine the noblest type of man and aim simply at maintaining the largest possible number of persons of that class and it will be found that the largest possible number of every healthy subordinate class must necessarily be produced also  the perfect type of manhood as just stated involves the perfections whatever we may hereafter determine these to be of his body affections and intelligence the material things therefore which it is the object of political economy to produce and use or accumulate for use are things which serve either to sustain and comfort the body or exercise rightly the affections and form the intelligence67 whatever truly serves either of these purposes is useful to man wholesome healthful helpful or holy by seeking such things man prolongs and increases his life upon the earth     67 it may be observed in anticipation of some of our future         results that while some conditions of the affections are         aimed at by the economist as final others are necessary to         him as his own instruments as he obtains them in greater or         less degree his own farther work becomes more or less         possible such for instance are the fortifying virtues         which the wisest men of all time have with more or less         distinctness arranged under the general heads of prudence         or discretion the spirit which discerns and adopts         rightly justice the spirit which rules and divides         rightly fortitude the spirit which persists and endures         rightly and temperance the spirit which stops and refuses         rightly or in shorter terms still the virtues which teach         how to consist assist persist and desist these outermost         virtues are not only the means of protecting and prolonging         life itself but they are the chief guards or sources of the         material means of life and are the visible governing powers         and princes of economy thus reserving detailed statements         for the sequel precisely according to the number of just         men in a nation is their power of avoiding either intestine         or foreign war all disputes may be peaceably settled if a         sufficient number of persons have been trained to submit to         the principles of justice the necessity for war is in         direct ratio to the number of unjust persons who are         incapable of determining a quarrel but by violence whether         the injustice take the form of the desire of dominion or of         refusal to submit to it or of lust of territory or lust of         money or of mere irregular passion and wanton will the         result is economically the sameloss of the quantity of         power and life consumed in repressing the injustice as well         as of that requiring to be repressed added to the material         and moral destruction caused by the fact of war the early         civil wars of england and the existing war in america are         curious examplesthese under monarchical this under         republican institutionsof the results of the want of         education of large masses of nations in principles of         justice this latter war especially may perhaps at least         serve for some visible or if that be impossible for the         greeks told us that plutus was blind as dante that he was         speechless some feelable proof that true political economy         is an ethical and by no means a commercial business the         americans imagined themselves to know somewhat of         moneymaking bowed low before their dollar expecting         divine help from it more than potenteven omnipotent yet         all the while this apparently tangible was indeed an         imaginary deityand had they shown the substance of him to         any true economist or even true mineralogist they would         have been told long years agoalas gentlemen this that         you are gaining is not goldnot a particle of it it is         yellow and glittering and like enough to the real         metalbut seeit is brittle catgold iron firestone         out of this heap it as high as you will you will get so         much steel and brimstonenothing else and in a year or         two when had you known a little of right economy you         might have had quiet rooftrees over your heads and a fair         account at your bankers you shall instead have to sleep         afield under red tapestries costliest yet comfortless         and at your bankers find deficit at compound interest but         the mere dread or distrust resulting from the want of inner         virtues of faith and charity among nations is often no less         costly than war itself the fear which france and england         have of each other costs each nation about fifteen millions         sterling annually besides various paralyses of commerce         that sum being spent in the manufacture of means of         destruction instead of means of production there is no more         reason in the nature of things that france and england         should be hostile to each other than that england and         scotland should be or lancashire and yorkshire and the         reciprocal terrors of the opposite sides of the english         channel are neither more necessary more economical nor         more virtuous than the old riding and reiving on opposite         flanks of the cheviots or than englands own weaving for         herself of crowns of thorn from the stems of her red and         white roses  on the other hand whatever does not serve either of these purposesmuch more whatever counteracts themis in like manner useless to man unwholesome unhelpful or unholy and by seeking such things man shortens and diminishes his life upon the earth and neither with respect to things useful or useless can mans estimate of them alter their nature certain substances being good for his food and others noxious to him what he thinks or wishes respecting them can neither change their nature nor prevent their power if he eats corn he will live if nightshade he will die if he produce or make good and beautiful things they will recreate him note the solemnity and weight of the word if bad and ugly things they will corrupt or break in piecesthat is in the exact degree of their power kill him for every hour of labour however enthusiastic or well intended which he spends for that which is not bread so much possibility of life is lost to him his fancies likings beliefs however brilliant eager or obstinate are of no avail if they are set on a false object of all that he has laboured for the eternal law of heaven and earth measures out to him for reward to the utmost atom that part which he ought to have laboured for and withdraws from him or enforces on him it may be inexorably that part which he ought not to have laboured for the dust and chaff are all to the last speck winnowed away and on his summer threshingfloor stands his heap of corn little or much not according to his labour but to his discretion no commercial arrangements no painting of surfaces nor alloying of substances will avail him a pennyweight nature asks of him calmly and inevitably what have you found or formedthe right thing or the wrong by the right thing you shall live by the wrong you shall die  to thoughtless persons it seems otherwise the world looks to them as if they could cozen it out of some ways and means of life but they cannot cozen it they can only cozen their neighbours the world is not to be cheated of a grain not so much as a breath of its air can be drawn surreptitiously for every piece of wise work done so much life is granted for every piece of foolish work nothing for every piece of wicked work so much death this is as sure as the courses of day and night but when the means of life are once produced men by their various struggles and industries of accumulation or exchange may variously gather waste restrain or distribute them necessitating in proportion to the waste or restraint accurately so much more death the rate and range of additional death is measured by the rate and range of waste and is inevitablethe only question determined mostly by fraud in peace and force in war is who is to die and how  such being the everlasting law of human existence the essential work of the political economist is to determine what are in reality useful and lifegiving things and by what degrees and kinds of labour they are attainable and distributable this investigation divides itself under three great headsfirst of wealth secondly of money and thirdly of riches  these terms are often used as synonymous but they signify entirely different things wealth consists of things in themselves valuable money of documentary claims to the possession of such things and riches is a relative term expressing the magnitude of the possessions of one person or society as compared with those of other persons or societies  the study of wealth is a province of natural scienceit deals with the essential properties of things  the study of money is a province of commercial scienceit deals with conditions of engagement and exchange  the study of riches is a province of moral scienceit deals with the due relations of men to each other in regard of material possessions and with the just laws of their association for purposes of labour  i shall in this paper shortly sketch out the range of subjects which will come before us as we follow these three branches of inquiry   section iwealth  wealth it has been said consists of things essentially valuable we now therefore need a definition of value  value signifies the strength or availing of anything towards the sustaining of life and is always twofold that is to say primarily intrinsic and secondarily effectual  the reader must by anticipation be warned against confusing value with cost or with price value is the lifegiving power of anything cost the quantity of labour required to produce it price the quantity of labour which its possessor will take in exchange for it cost and price are commercial conditions to be studied under the head of money  intrinsic value is the absolute power of anything to support life a sheaf of wheat of given quality and weight has in it a measurable power of sustaining the substance of the body a cubic foot of pure air a fixed power of sustaining its warmth and a cluster of flowers of given beauty a fixed power of enlivening or animating the senses and heart  it does not in the least affect the intrinsic value of the wheat the air or the flowers that men refuse or despise them used or not their own power is in them and that particular power is in nothing else  but in order that this value of theirs may become effectual a certain state is necessary in the recipient of it the digesting the breathing and perceiving functions must be perfect in the human creature before the food air or flowers can become their full value to it the production of effectual value therefore always involves two needs first the production of a thing essentially useful then the production of the capacity to use it where the intrinsic value and acceptant capacity come together there is effectual value or wealth where there is either no intrinsic value or no acceptant capacity there is no effectual value that is to say no wealth a horse is no wealth to us if we cannot ride nor a picture if we cannot see nor can any noble thing be wealth except to a noble person as the aptness of the user increases the effectual value of the thing used increases and in its entirety can coexist only with perfect skill of use or harmony of nature the effectual value of a given quantity of any commodity existing in the world at any moment is therefore a mathematical function of the capacity existing in the human race to enjoy it let its intrinsic value be represented by x and the recipient faculty by y its effectual value is x y in which the sum varies as either coefficient varies is increased by eithers increase68 and cancelled by eithers absence     68 with this somewhat strange and ungeometrical limitation         however which here expressed for the moment in the         briefest terms we must afterwards trace in detailthat x         y may be indefinitely increased by the increase of y         only but not by the increase of x unless y increases         also in a fixed proportion  valuable material things may be conveniently referred to five heads  1 land with an associated air water and organisms  2 houses furniture and instruments  3 stored or prepared food and medicine and articles of bodily luxury including clothing  4 books  5 works of art  we shall enter into separate inquiry as to the conditions of value under each of these heads the following sketch of the entire subject may be useful for future reference  1 land its value is twofold    a as producing food and mechanical power   b as an object of sight and thought producing intellectual power  a its value as a means of producing food and mechanical power varies with its form as mountain or plain with its substance in soil or mineral contents and with its climate all these conditions of intrinsic value in order to give effectual value must be known and complied with by the men who have to deal with it but at any given time or place the intrinsic value is fixed such and such a piece of land with its associated lakes and seas rightly treated in surface and substance can produce precisely so much food and power and no more its surface treatment agriculture and substance treatment practical geology and chemistry are the first roots of economical science by surface treatment however i mean more than agriculture as commonly understood i mean land and sea culturedominion over both the fixed and the flowing fieldsperfect acquaintance with the laws of climate and of vegetable and animal growth in the given tracts of earth or ocean and of their relations regulating especially the production of those articles of food which being in each particular spot producible in the highest perfection will bring the best price in commercial exchanges  b the second element of value in land is its beauty united with such conditions of space and form as are necessary for exercise or pleasant to the eye associated with vital organism  land of the highest value in these respects is that lying in temperate climates and boldly varied in form removed from unhealthy or dangerous influences as of miasm or volcano and capable of sustaining a rich fauna and flora such land carefully tended by the hand of man so far as to remove from it unsightlinesses and evidences of decay guarded from violence and inhabited under mans affectionate protection by every kind of living creature that can occupy it in peace forms the most precious property that human beings can possess  the determination of the degree in which these two elements of value can be united in land or in which either element must or should in particular cases be sacrificed to the other forms the most important branch of economical inquiry respecting preferences of things  2 buildings furniture and instruments  the value of buildings consistsa in permanent strength with convenience of form of size and of position so as to render employment peaceful social intercourse easy temperature and air healthy the advisable or possible magnitude of cities and mode of their distribution in squares streets courts etc the relative value of sites of land and the modes of structure which are healthiest and most permanent have to be studied under this head  b the value of buildings consists secondarily in historical association and architectural beauty of which we have to examine the influence on manners and life  the value of instruments consists  a in their power of shortening labour or otherwise accomplishing as ships what human strength unaided could not the kinds of work which are severally best accomplished by hand or by machinethe effect of machinery in gathering and multiplying population and its influence on the minds and bodies of such population together with the conceivable uses of machinery on a colossal scale in accomplishing mighty and useful works hitherto unthought of such as the deepening of large river channelschanging the surface of mountainous districtsirrigating tracts of desert in the torrid zonebreaking up and thus rendering capable of quicker fusion edges of ice in the northern and southern arctic seas etc so rendering parts of the earth habitable which hitherto have not been so are to be studied under this head  b the value of instruments is secondarily in their aid to abstract sciences the degree in which the multiplication of such instruments should be encouraged so as to make them if large easy of access to numbers as costly telescopes or so cheap as that they might in a serviceable form become a common part of the furniture of households is to be considered under this head  3 food medicine and articles of luxury under this head we shall have to examine the possible methods of obtaining pure and nourishing food in such security and equality of supply as to avoid both waste and famine then the economy of medicine and just range of sanitary law finally the economy of luxury partly an aesthetic and partly an ethical question  4 books the value of these consists  a in their power of preserving and communicating the knowledge of facts  b in their power of exciting vital or noble emotion and intellectual action they have also their corresponding negative powers of disguising and effacing the memory of facts and killing the noble emotions or exciting base ones under these two heads we have to consider the economical and educational value positive and negative of literaturethe means of producing and educating good authors and the means and advisability of rendering good books generally accessible and directing the readers choice to them  5 works of art the value of these is of the same nature as that of books but the laws of their production and possible modes of distribution are very different and require separate examination   section iimoney  under this head we shall have to examine the laws of currency and exchange of which i will note here the first principles  money has been inaccurately spoken of as merely a means of circulation it is on the contrary an expression of right it is not wealth being the sign69 of the relative quantities of it to which at a given time persons or societies are entitled     69 always and necessarily an imperfect sign but capable         of approximate accuracy if rightly ordered  if all the money in the world notes and gold were destroyed in an instant it would leave the world neither richer nor poorer than it was but it would leave the individual inhabitants of it in different relations  money is therefore correspondent in its nature to the titledeed of an estate though the deed be burned the estate still exists but the right to it has become disputable  the worth of money remains unchanged as long as the proportion of the quantity of existing money to the quantity of existing wealth or available labour which it professes to represent remains unchanged  if the wealth increases but not the money the worth of the money increases if the money increases but not the wealth the worth of the money diminishes  money therefore cannot be arbitrarily multiplied any more than titledeeds can so long as the existing wealth or available labour is not fully represented by the currency the currency may be increased without diminution of the assigned worth of its pieces but when the existing wealth or available labour is once fully represented every piece of money thrown into circulation diminishes the worth of every other existing piece in the proportion it bears to the number of them provided the new piece be received with equal credit if not the depreciation of worth takes place exclusively in the new piece according to the inferiority of its credit  when however new money composed of some substance of supposed intrinsic value as of gold is brought into the market or when new notes are issued which are supposed to be deserving of credit the desire to obtain money will under certain circumstances stimulate industry an additional quantity of wealth is immediately produced and if this be in proportion to the new claims advanced the value of the existing currency is undepreciated if the stimulus given be so great as to produce more goods than are proportioned to the additional coinage the worth of the existing currency will be raised  arbitrary control and issues of currency affect the production of wealth by acting on the hopes and fears of men and are under certain circumstances wise but the issue of additional currency to meet the exigencies of immediate expense is merely one of the disguised forms of borrowing or taxing  it is however in the present low state of economical knowledge often possible for governments to venture on an issue of currency when they could not venture on an additional loan or tax because the real operation of such issue is not understood by the people and the pressure of it is irregularly distributed and with an unperceived gradation finally the use of substances of intrinsic value as the materials of a currency is a barbarisma remnant of the conditions of barter which alone can render commerce possible among savage nations it is however still necessary partly as a mechanical check on arbitrary issues partly as a means of exchanges with foreign nations in proportion to the extension of civilization and increase of trustworthiness in governments it will cease so long as it exists the phenomena of the cost and price of the articles used for currency are mingled with those of currency itself in an almost inextricable manner and the worth of money in the market is affected by multitudinous accidental circumstances which have been traced with more or less success by writers on commercial operations but with these variations the true political economist has no more to do than an engineer fortifying a harbour of refuge against atlantic tide has to concern himself with the cries or quarrels of children who dig pools with their fingers for its ebbing currents among the sand   section iiiriches  according to the various industry capacity good fortune and desires of men they obtain greater or smaller share of and claim upon the wealth of the world  the inequalities between these shares always in some degree just and necessary may be either restrained by law or circumstance within certain limits or may increase indefinitely  where no moral or legal restraint is put upon the exercise of the will and intellect of the stronger shrewder or more covetous men these differences become ultimately enormous but as soon as they become so distinct in their extremes as that on one side there shall be manifest redundance of possession and on the other manifest pressure of needthe terms riches and poverty are used to express the opposite states being contrary only in the manner of the terms warmth and cold which neither of them imply an actual degree but only a relation to other degrees of temperature  respecting riches the economist has to inquire first into the advisable modes of their collection secondly into the advisable modes of their administration respecting the collection of national riches he has to inquire first whether he is justified in calling the nation rich if the quantity of money it possesses relatively to that possessed by other nations be large irrespectively of the manner of its distribution or does the mode of distribution in any wise affect the nature of the riches thus if the king alone be richsuppose croesus or mausolusare the lydians and carians therefore a rich nation or if one or two slavemasters be rich and the nation be otherwise composed of slaves is it to be called a rich nation for if not and the ideas of a certain mode of distribution or operation in the riches and of a certain degree of freedom in the people enter into our idea of riches as attributed to a people we shall have to define the degree of fluency or circulative character which is essential to their vitality and the degree of independence of action required in their possessors questions which look as if they would take time in answering and farther since there are two modes in which the inequality which is indeed the condition and constituent of riches may be establishednamely by increase of possession on the one side and by decrease of it on the otherwe have to inquire with respect to any given state of riches precisely in what manner the correlative poverty was produced that is to say whether by being surpassed only or being depressed what are the advantages or the contrary conceivable in the depression for instance it being one of the commonest advantages of being rich to entertain a number of servants we have to inquire on the one side what economical process produced the poverty of the persons who serve him and what advantage each on his own side derives from the result  these being the main questions touching the collection of riches the next or last part of the inquiry is into their administration  they have in the main three great economical powers which require separate examination namely the powers of selection direction and provision  a their power of selection relates to things of which the supply is limited as the supply of best things is always when it becomes matter of question to whom such things are to belong the richest person has necessarily the first choice unless some arbitrary mode of distribution be otherwise determined upon the business of the economist is to show how this choice may be a wise one  b their power of direction arises out of the necessary relation of rich men to poor which ultimately in one way or another involves the direction of or authority over the labour of the poor and this nearly as much over their mental as their bodily labour the business of the economist is to show how this direction may be a just one  c their power of provision or preparatory sight for proaccumulation is by no means necessarily provision is dependent upon their redundance which may of course by active persons be made available in preparation for future work or future profit in which function riches have generally received the name of capital that is to say of head or sourcematerial the business of the economist is to show how this provision may be a distant one  the examination of these three functions of riches will embrace every final problem of political economyand above or before all this curious and vital problemwhether since the wholesome action of riches in these three functions will depend it appears on the wisdom justice and farsightedness of the holders and it is by no means to be assumed that persons primarily rich must therefore be just and wiseit may not be ultimately possible so or somewhat so to arrange matters as that persons primarily just and wise should therefore be rich  such being the general plan of the inquiry before us i shall not limit myself to any consecutive following of it having hardly any good hope of being able to complete so laborious a work as it must prove to me but from time to time as i have leisure shall endeavour to carry forward this part or that as may be immediately possible indicating always with accuracy the place which the particular essay will or should take in the completed system     ii  nature of wealth variations of value the national store nature of labour value and price the currency   the last paper having consisted of little more than definition of terms i purpose in this to expand and illustrate the given definitions so as to avoid confusion in their use when we enter into the detail of our subject  the view which has been taken of the nature of wealth namely that it consists in an intrinsic value developed by a vital power is directly opposed to two nearly universal conceptions of wealth in the assertion that value is primarily intrinsic it opposes the idea that anything which is an object of desire to numbers and is limited in quantity may be called or virtually become wealth and in the assertion that value is secondarily dependent upon power in the possessor it opposes the idea that wealth consists of things exchangeable at rated prices before going farther we will make these two positions clearer   first all wealth is intrinsic and is not constituted by the judgment of men this is easily seen in the case of things affecting the body we know that no force of fantasy will make stones nourishing or poison innocent but it is less apparent in things affecting the mind we are easilyperhaps willinglymisled by the appearance of beneficial results obtained by industries addressed wholly to the gratification of fanciful desire and apt to suppose that whatever is widely coveted dearly bought and pleasurable in possession must be included in our definition of wealth it is the more difficult to quit ourselves of this error because many things which are true wealth in moderate use yet become false wealth in immoderate and many things are mixed of good and evilas mostly books and works of artout of which one person will get the good and another the evil so that it seems as if there were no fixed good or evil in the things themselves but only in the view taken and use made of them but that is not so the evil and good are fixed in essence and in proportion they are separable by instinct and judgment but not interchangeable and in things in which evil depends upon excess the point of excess though indefinable is fixed and the power of the thing is on the hither side for good and on the farther side for evil and in all cases this power is inherent not dependent on opinion or choice our thoughts of things neither make nor mar their eternal force norwhich is the most serious point for future considerationcan they prevent the effect of it upon ourselves  therefore the object of special analysis of wealth into which we have presently to enter will be not so much to enumerate what is serviceable as to distinguish what is destructive and to show that it is inevitably destructive that to receive pleasure from an evil thing is not to escape from or alter the evil of it but to be altered by it that is to suffer from it to the utmost having our own nature in that degree made evil also and it will be shown farther that through whatever length of time or subtleties of connexion the harm is accomplished being also less or more according to the fineness and worth of the humanity on which it is wrought still nothing but harm ever comes of a bad thing  so that finally wealth is not the accidental object of a morbid desire but the constant object of a legitimate one70 by the fury of ignorance and fitfulness of caprice large interests may be continually attached to things unserviceable or hurtful if their nature could be altered by our passions the science of political economy would be but as the weighing of clouds and the portioning out of shadows but of ignorance there is no science and of caprice no law their disturbing forces interfere with the operations of economy but have nothing in common with them the calm arbiter of national destiny regards only essential power for good in all it accumulates and alike disdains the wanderings of imagination and the thirsts of disease     70 few passages of the book which at least some part of the         nations at present most advanced in civilization accept as         an expression of final truth have been more distorted than         those bearing on idolatry for the idolatry there denounced         is neither sculpture nor veneration of sculpture it is         simply the substitution of an eidolon phantasm or         imagination of good for that which is real and enduring         from the highest living good which gives life to the         lowest material good which ministers to it the creator and         the things created which he is said to have seen good in         creating are in this their eternal goodness always called         helpful or holy and the sweep and range of idolatry extend         to the rejection of all or any of these calling evil good         or good evilputting bitter for sweet and sweet for         bitter so betraying the first of all loyalties to the         fixed law of life and with resolute opposite loyalty         serving our own imagination of good which is the law not         of the dwelling but of the grave otherwise called the law         of error or mark missing which we translate law of         sin these two masters between whose services we have         to choose being otherwise distinguished as god and         mammon which mammon though we narrowly take it as the         power of money only is in truth the great evil spirit of         false and fond desire or covetousness which is idolatry         so that iconoclasmimage or likenessbreakingis easy but         an idol cannot be brokenit must be forsaken and this is         not so easy either in resolution or persuasion for men may         readily be convinced of the weakness of an image but not of         the emptiness of a phantasm  secondly the assertion that wealth is not only intrinsic but dependent in order to become effectual on a given degree of vital power in its possessor is opposed to another popular view of wealthnamely that though it may always be constituted by caprice it is when so constituted a substantial thing of which given quantities may be counted as existing here or there and exchangeable at rated prices  in this view there are three errors the first and chief is the overlooking the fact that all exchangeableness of commodity or effective demand for it depends on the sum of capacity for its use existing here or elsewhere the book we cannot read or picture we take no delight in may indeed be called part of our wealth in so far as we have power of exchanging either for something we like better but our power of effecting such exchange and yet more of effecting it to advantage depends absolutely on the number of accessible persons who can understand the book or enjoy the painting and who will dispute the possession of them thus the actual worth of either even to us depends no less on their essential goodness than on the capacity consisting somewhere for the perception of it and it is vain in any completed system of production to think of obtaining one without the other so that though the great political economist knows that coexistence of capacity for use with temporary possession cannot be always secured the final fact on which he bases all action and administration is that in the whole nation or group of nations he has to deal with for every grain of intrinsic value produced he must with exactest chemistry produce its twin grain of governing capacity or in the degrees of his failure he has no wealth natures challenge to us is in earnest as the assyrians mock i will give you two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them baviecas paces are brave if the cid backs him but woe to us if we take the dust of capacity wearing the armour of it for capacity itself for so all procession however goodly in the show of it is to the tomb  the second error in this popular view of wealth is that in estimating property which we cannot use as wealth because it is exchangeable we in reality confuse wealth with money the land we have no skill to cultivate the book which is sealed to us or dress which is superfluous may indeed be exchangeable but as such are nothing more than a cumbrous form of banknote of doubtful and slow convertibility as long as we retain possession of them we merely keep our banknotes in the shape of gravel or clay of book leaves or of embroidered tissue circumstances may perhaps render such forms the safest or a certain complacency may attach to the exhibition of theminto both these advantages we shall inquire afterwards i wish the reader only to observe here that exchangeable property which we cannot use is to us personally merely one of the forms of money not of wealth  the third error in the popular view is the confusion of guardianship with possession the real state of men of property being too commonly that of curators not possessors of wealth for a mans power of use administration ostentation destruction or bequest and possession is in use only which for each man is sternly limited so that such things and so much of them are well for him or wealth and more of them or any other things are ill for him or illth plunged to the lips in orinoco he shall drink to his thirst measuremore at his peril with a thousand oxen on his lands he shall eat to his hunger measuremore at his peril he cannot live in two houses at once a few bales of silk or wool will suffice for the fabric of all the clothes he can ever wear and a few books will probably hold all the furniture good for his brain71 beyond these in the best of us but narrow capacities we have but the power of administering or if for harm maladministering wealth that is to say distributing lending or increasing itof exhibiting it as in magnificence of retinue or furniture of destroying or finally of bequeathing it and with multitudes of rich men administration degenerates into curatorship they merely hold their property in charge as trustees for the benefit of some person or persons to whom it is to be delivered upon their death and the position explained in clear terms would hardly seem a covetable one what would be the probable decision of a youth on his entrance into life to whom the career hoped for him was proposed in terms such as these you must work unremittingly and with your utmost intelligence during all your available years you will thus accumulate wealth to a large amount but you must touch none of it beyond what is needful for your support whatever sums you may gain beyond those required for your decent and moderate maintenance shall be properly taken care of and on your deathbed you shall have the power of determining to whom they shall belong or to what purposes be applied     71 i reserve until the completion and collection of these         papers any support by the authority of other writers of the         statements made in them were indeed such authorities         wisely sought for and shown there would be no occasion for         my writing at all even in the scattered passages referring         to this subject in three books of carlylessartor         resartus past and present and the latterday         pamphlets all has been said that needs to be said and far         better than i shall ever say it again but the habit of the         public mind at the present is to require everything to be         uttered diffusely loudly and seven times over before it         will listen and it has exclaimed against these papers of         mine as if they contained things daring and new when there         is not one assertion in them of which the truth has not been         for ages known to the wisest and proclaimed by the most         eloquent of men it will be a far greater pleasure to me         hereafter to collect their words than add to mine horaces         clear rendering of the substance of the preceding passages         in the text may be found room for at

is perhaps desirable also to give xenophons         statement it being clearer than any english one can be         owing to the power of the general greek term for wealth         useable things

such conditions would probably be neither zealous nor cheerful yet the only difference between this position and that of the ordinary capitalist is the power which the latter delights in supposing himself to possess and which is attributed to him by others of spending his money at any moment this pleasure taken in the imagination of power to part with that which we have no intention of parting with is one of the most curious though commonest forms of eidolon or phantasm of wealth but the political economist has nothing to do with this idealism and looks only to the practical issue of itnamely that the holder of wealth in such temper may be regarded simply as a mechanical means of collection or as a moneychest with a slit in it72 set in the public thoroughfarechest of which only death has the key and probably chance the distribution of contents in his function of lender which however is one of administration not use as far as he is himself concerned the capitalist takes indeed a more interesting aspect but even in that function his relations with the state are apt to degenerate into a mechanism for the convenient contraction of debta function the more mischievous because a nation invariably appeases its conscience with respect to an unjustifiable expense by meeting it with borrowed fundsexpresses its repentance of a foolish piece of business by letting its tradesmen wait for their moneyand always leaves its descendants to pay for the work which will be of the least service to them73     72 the orifice being not merely of a receptant but of a         suctional character among the types of human virtue and         vice presented grotesquely by the lower animals perhaps         none is more curiously definite that that of avarice in the         cephalopod a creature which has a purse for a body a         hawks beak for a mouth suckers for feet and hands and         whose house is its own skeleton     73 it would be well if a somewhat dogged conviction could         be enforced on nations as on individuals that with few         exceptions what they cannot at present pay for they should         not at present have  quit of these three sources of misconception the reader will have little farther difficulty in apprehending the real nature of effectual value he may however at first not without surprise perceive the consequences involved in the acceptance of our definition for if the actual existence of wealth be dependent on the power of its possessor it follows that the sum of wealth held by the nation instead of being constant or calculable varies hourly nay momentarily with the number and character of its holders and that in changing hands it changes in quantity and farther since the worth of the currency is proportioned to the sum of material wealth which it represents if the sum of the wealth changes the worth of the currency changes and thus both the sum of the property and power of the currency of the state vary momentarily as the character and number of the holders and not only so but a different rate and manner of variation is caused by the character of the holders of different kinds of wealth the transitions of value caused by the character of the holders of land differ in mode from those caused by character in holders of works of art and these again from those caused by character in holders of machinery or other working capital but we cannot examine these special phenomena of any kind of wealth until we have a clear idea of the way in which true currency expresses them and of the resulting modes in which the cost and price of any article are related to its value to obtain this we must approach the subject in its first elements  let us suppose a national store of wealth real or imaginary that is to say composed of material things either useful or believed to be so presided over by a government74 and that every workman having produced any article involving labour in its production and for which he has no immediate use brings it to add to this store receiving from the government in exchange an order either for the return of the thing itself or of its equivalent in other things75 such as he may choose out of the store at any time when he needs them now supposing that the labourer speedily uses this general order or in common language spends the money he has neither changed the circumstances of the nation nor his own except in so far as he may have produced useful and consumed useless articles or vice versa but if he does not use or uses in part only the order he receives and lays aside some portion of it and thus every day bringing his contribution to the national store lays by some percentage of the order received in exchange for it he increases the national wealth daily by as much as he does not use of the received order and to the same amount accumulates a monetary claim on the government it is of course always in his power as it is his legal right to bring forward this accumulation of claim and at once to consume to destroy or distribute the sum of his wealth supposing he never does so but dies leaving his claim to others he has enriched the state during his life by the quantity of wealth over which that claim extends or has in other words rendered so much additional life possible in the state of which additional life he bequeaths the immediate possibility to those whom he invests with his claim he would distribute this possibility of life among the nation at large     74 the reader is to include here in the idea of government         any branch of the executive or even any body of private         persons entrusted with the practical management of public         interests unconnected directly with their own personal ones         in theoretical discussions of legislative interference         with political economy it is usually and of course         unnecessarily assumed that government must be always of         that form and force in which we have been accustomed to see         itthat its abuses can never be less nor its wisdom         greater nor its powers more numerous but practically the         custom in most civilized countries is for every man to         deprecate the interference of government as long as things         tell for his personal advantage and to call for it when         they cease to do so the request of the manchester         economists to be supplied with cotton by the government the         system of supply and demand having for the time fallen         sorrowfully short of the expectations of scientific persons         from it is an interesting case in point it were to be         wished that less wide and bitter suffering suffering too         of the innocent had been needed to force the nation or         some part of it to ask itself why a body of men already         confessedly capable of managing matters both military and         divine should not be permitted or even requested at need         to provide in some wise for sustenance as well as for         defence and secure if it might be and it might i think         even the rather be purity of bodily ailment as well as of         religious conviction why having made many roads for the         passage of armies they may not make a few for the         conveyance of food and after organizing with applause         various schemes of spiritual instruction for the public         organize moreover some methods of bodily nourishment for         them or is the soul so much less trustworthy in its         instincts than the stomach that legislation is necessary         for the one but inconvenient to the other          there is a strange fallacy running at this time through all         talk about free trade it is continually assumed that every         kind of government interference takes away liberty of trade         whereas liberty is lost only when interference hinders not         when it helps you do not take away a mans freedom by         showing him his roadnor by making it smoother for him not         that it is always desirable to do so but it may be nor         even by fencing it for him if there is an open ditch at the         side of it the real mode in which protection interferes         with liberty and the real evil of it is not in its         protecting one person but in its hindering another a         form of interference which invariably does most mischief to         the person it is intended to serve which the northern         americans are about discomfortably to discover unless they         think better of it there is also a ludicrous confusion in         many persons minds between protection and encouragement         they differ materially protection is saying to         the commercial schoolboy nobody shall hit you         encouragement is saying to him thats the way to         hit     75 the question of equivalence namely how much wine a man         is to receive in return for so much corn or how much coal         in return for so much iron is a quite separate one which         we will examine presently for the time let it be assumed         that this equivalence has been determined and that the         government order in exchange for a fixed weight of any         article called suppose a is either for the return of         that weight of the article itself or of another fixed         weight of the article b or another of the article c         and so on  we hitherto consider the government itself as simply a conservative power taking charge of the wealth entrusted to it  but a government may be far other than a conservative power it may be on the one hand constructive on the other destructive  if a constructive or improving power using all the wealth entrusted to it to the best advantage the nation is enriched in root and branch at once and the government is enabled for every order presented to return a quantity of wealth greater than the order was written for according to the fructification obtained in the interim76     76 the reader must be warned in advance that the conditions         here supposed have nothing to do with the interest of         money commonly so called  this ability may be either concealed in which case the currency does not completely represent the wealth of the country or it may be manifested by the continual payment of the excess of value on each order in which case there is irrespectively observe of collateral results afterwards to be examined a perpetual rise in the worth of the currency that is to say a fall in the price of all articles represented by it  but if the government be destructive or a consuming power it becomes unable to return the value received on the presentation of the order  this inability may either a be concealed by meeting demands to the full until it issue in bankruptcy or in some form of national debtor b it may be concealed during oscillatory movements between destructiveness and productiveness which result on the whole in stabilityor c it may be manifested by the consistent return of less than value received on each presented order in which case there is a consistent fall in the worth of the currency or rise in the price of the things represented by it  now if for this conception of a central government we substitute that of another body of persons occupied in industrial pursuits of whom each adds in his private capacity to the common store so that the store itself instead of remaining a public property of ascertainable quantity for the guardianship of which a body of public men are responsible becomes disseminated private property each man giving in exchange for any article received from another a general order for its equivalent in whatever other article the claimant may desire such general order being payable by any member of the society in whose possession the demanded article may be found we at once obtain an approximation to the actual condition of a civilized mercantile community from which approximation we might easily proceed into still completer analysis i purpose however to arrive at every result by the gradual expansion of the simpler conception but i wish the reader to observe in the meantime that both the social conditions thus supposed and i will by anticipation say also all possible social conditions agree in two great points namely in the primal importance of the supposed national store or stock and in its destructibility or improvability by the holders of it  i observe that in both conditions that of central governmentholding and diffused privateholding the quantity of stock is of the same national moment in the one case indeed its amount may be known by examination of the persons to whom it is confided in the other it cannot be known but by exposing the private affairs of every individual but known or unknown its significance is the same under each condition the riches of the nation consist in the abundance and their wealth depends on the nature of this store  ii in the second place both conditions and all other possible ones agree in the destructibility or improvability of the store by its holders whether in private hands or under government charge the national store may be daily consumed or daily enlarged by its possessors and while the currency remains apparently unaltered the property it represents may diminish or increase  the first question then which we have to put under our simple conception of central government namely what store has it is one of equal importance whatever may be the constitution of the state while the second questionnamely who are the holders of the storeinvolves the discussion of the constitution of the state itself  the first inquiry resolves itself into three heads    1 what is the nature of the store   2 what is its quantity in relation to the population   3 what is its quantity in relation to the currency  the second inquiry into two    1 who are the holders of the store and in what proportions   2 who are the claimants of the store that is to say the holders      of the currency and in what proportions  we will examine the range of the first three questions in the present paper of the two following in the sequel  question first what is the nature of the store has the nation hitherto worked for and gathered the right thing or the wrong on that issue rest the possibilities of its life  for example let us imagine a society of no great extent occupied in procuring and laying up store of corn wine wool silk and other such preservable materials of food and clothing and that it has a currency representing them imagine farther that on days of festivity the society discovering itself to derive satisfaction from pyrotechnics gradually turns its attention more and more to the manufacture of gunpowder so that an increasing number of labourers giving what time they can spare to this branch of industry bring increasing quantities of combustibles into the store and use the general orders received in exchange to obtain such wine wool or corn as they may have need of the currency remains the same and represents precisely the same amount of material in the store and of labour spent in producing it but the corn and wine gradually vanish and in their place as gradually appear sulphur and saltpetre till at last the labourers who have consumed corn and supplied nitre presenting on a festal morning some of their currency to obtain materials for the feast discover that no amount of currency will command anything festive except fire the supply of rockets is unlimited but that of food limited in a quite final manner and the whole currency in the hands of the society represents an infinite power of detonation but none of existence  the statement caricatured as it may seem is only exaggerated in assuming the persistence of the folly to extremity unchecked as in reality it would be by the gradual rise in price of food but it falls short of the actual facts of human life in expression of the depth and intensity of the folly itself for a great part the reader would not believe how great until he saw the statistics in detail of the most earnest and ingenious industry of the world is spent in producing munitions of war gathering that is to say the materials not of festive but of consuming fire filling its stores with all power of the instruments of pain and all affluence of the ministries of death it was no true trionfo della morte which men have seen and feared sometimes scarcely feared so longwherein he brought them rest from their labours we see and share another and higher form of his triumph now taskmaster instead of releaser he rules the dust of the arena no less than of the tomb and content once in the grave whither man went to make his works cease and his devices to vanishnow in the busy city and on the serviceable sea makes his work to increase and his devices to multiply  to this doubled loss or negative power of labour spent in producing means of destruction we have to add in our estimate of the consequences of human folly whatever more insidious waste of toil there is in the production of unnecessary luxury such and such an occupation it is said supports so many labourers because so many obtain wages in following it but it is never considered that unless there be a supporting power in the product of the occupation the wages given to one man are merely withdrawn from another we cannot say of any trade that it maintains such and such a number of persons unless we know how and where the money now spent in the purchase of its produce would have been spent if that produce had not been manufactured the purchasing funds truly support a number of people in making this but probably leave unsupported an equal number who are making or could have made that the manufacturers of small watches thrive in genevait is wellbut where would the money spent on small watches have gone had there been no small watches to buy  if the so frequently uttered aphorism of mercantile economylabour is limited by capitalwere true this question would be a definite one but it is untrue and that widely out of a given quantity of wages more or less labour is to be had according to the quantity of will with which we can inspire the workman and the true limit of labour is only in the limit of this moral stimulus of the will and the bodily power in an ultimate but entirely practical sense labour is limited by capital as it is by matterthat is to say where there is no material there can be no workbut in the practical sense labour is limited only by the great original capital77 of head heart and hand even in the most artificial relations of commerce it is to capital as fire to fuel out of so much fuel you shall have so much firenot in proportion to the mass of combustibles but to the force of wind that fans and water that quenches and the appliance of both and labour is furthered as conflagration is not so much by added fuel as by admitted air     77 the aphorism being hurried english for labour is limited         by want of capital involves also awkward english in its         denial which cannot be helped  for which reasons i had to insert above the qualifying probably for it can never be said positively that the purchase money or wages fund of any trade is withdrawn from some other trade the object itself may be the stimulus of the production of the money which buys it that is to say the work by which the purchaser obtained the means of buying it would not have been done by him unless he had wanted that particular thing and the production of any article not intrinsically nor in the process of manufacture injurious is useful if the desire of it causes productive labour in other directions  in the national store therefore the presence of things intrinsically valueless does not imply an entirely correlative absence of things valuable we cannot be certain that all the labour spent on vanity has been diverted from reality and that for every bad thing produced a precious thing has been lost in great measure the vain things represent the results of roused indolence they have been carved as toys in extra time and if they had not been made nothing else would have been made even to munitions of war this principle applies they partly represent the work of men who if they had not made spears would never have made pruninghooks and who are incapable of any activities but those of contest  thus then finally the nature of the store has to be considered under two main lights the one that of its immediate and actual utility the other that of the past national character which it signifies by its production and future character which it must develop by its uses and the issue of this investigation will be to show us that economy does not depend merely on principles of demand and supply but primarily on what is demanded and what is supplied  question second what is the quantity of the store in relation to the population it follows from what has been already stated that the accurate form in which this question has to be put iswhat quantity of each article composing the store exists in proportion to the real need for it by the population but we shall for the time assume in order to keep all our terms at the simplest that the store is wholly composed of useful articles and accurately proportioned to the several needs of them  now it does not follow because the store is large in proportion to the number of people that the people must be in comfort nor because it is small that they must be in distress an active and economical race always produces more than it requires and lives if it is permitted to do so in competence on the produce of its daily labour the quantity of its store great or small is therefore in many respects indifferent to it and cannot be inferred by its aspect similarly an inactive and wasteful population which cannot live by its daily labour but is dependent partly or wholly on consumption of its store may be by various difficulties hereafter to be examined in realization of getting at such store retained in a state of abject distress though its possessions may be immense but the results always involved in the magnitude of store are the commercial power of the nation its security and its mental character its commercial power in that according to the quantity of its store may be the extent of its dealings its security in that according to the quantity of its store are its means of sudden exertion or sustained endurance and its character in that certain conditions of civilization cannot be attained without permanent and continually accumulating store of great intrinsic value and of peculiar nature  now seeing that these three advantages arise from largeness of store in proportion to population the question arises immediately given the storeis the nation enriched by diminution of its numbers are a successful national speculation and a pestilence economically the same thing  this is in part a sophistical question such as it would be to ask whether a man was richer when struck by disease which must limit his life within a predicable period than he was when in health he is enabled to enlarge his current expenses and has for all purposes a larger sum at his immediate disposal for given the fortune the shorter the life the larger the annuity yet no man considers himself richer because he is condemned by his physician the logical reply is that since wealth is by definition only the means of life a nation cannot be enriched by its own mortality or in shorter words the life is more than the meat and existence itself more wealth than the means of existence whence of two nations who have equal store the more numerous is to be considered the richer provided the type of the inhabitant be as high for though the relative bulk of their store be less its relative efficiency or the amount of effectual wealth must be greater but if the type of the population be deteriorated by increase of its numbers we have evidence of poverty in its worst influence and then to determine whether the nation in its total may still be justifiably esteemed rich we must set or weigh the number of the poor against that of the rich  to effect which piece of scalework it is of course necessary to determine first who are poor and who are rich nor this only but also how poor and how rich they are which will prove a curious thermometrical investigation for we shall have to do for gold and for silver what we have done for quicksilverdetermine namely their freezingpoint their zero their temperate and feverheat points finally their vaporescent point at which riches sometimes explosively as lately in america make to themselves wingsand correspondently the number of degrees below zero at which poverty ceasing to brace with any wholesome cold burns to the bone  for the performance of these operations in the strictest sense scientific we will first look to the existing socalled science of political economy we will ask it to define for us the comparatively and superlatively rich and the comparatively and superlatively poor and on its own termsif any terms it can pronounceexamine in our prosperous england how many rich and how many poor people there are and whether the quantity and intensity of the poverty is indeed so overbalanced by the quantity and intensity of wealth that we may permit ourselves a luxurious blindness to it and call ourselves complacently a rich country and if we find no clear definition in the existing science we will endeavour for ourselves to fix the true degrees of the plutonic scale and to apply them  question third what is the quantity of the store in relation to the currency we have seen that the real worth of the currency so far as dependent on its relation to the magnitude of the store may vary within certain limits without affecting its worth in exchange the diminution or increase of the represented wealth may be unperceived and the currency may be taken either for more or less than it is truly worth usually it is taken for more and its power in exchange or creditpower is thus increased or retained up to a given strain upon its relation to existing wealth this creditpower is of chief importance in the thoughts because most sharply present to the experience of a mercantile community but the conditions of its stability78 and all other relations of the currency to the material store are entirely simple in principle if not in action far other than simple are the relations of the currency to that available labour which by our definition p 219 it also represents for this relation is involved not only with that of the magnitude of the store to the number but with that of the magnitude of the store to the mind of the population its proportion to their number and the resulting worth of currency are calculable but its proportion to their will for labour is not the worth of the piece of money which claims a given quantity of the store is in exchange less or greater according to the facility of obtaining the same quantity of the same thing without having recourse to the store in other words it depends on the immediate cost and price of the thing we must now therefore complete the definition of these terms     78 these are nearly all briefly represented by the image used         for the force of money by dante of mast and sail            quali dal vento be gonfiate vele           caggiono avvolte poi chè lalber fiacca           tal cadde a terra la fiera crudele          the image may be followed out like all of dantes into as         close detail as the reader chooses thus the stress of the         sail must be proportioned to the strength of mast and it is         only in unforeseen danger that a skilful seaman ever carries         all the canvas his spars will bear states of mercantile         languor are like the flap of the sail in a calmof         mercantile precaution like taking in reefs and the         mercantile ruin is instant on the breaking of the mast  all cost and price are counted in labour we must know first therefore what is to be counted as labour  i have already defined labour to be the contest of the life of man with an opposite79 literally it is the quantity of lapse loss or failure of human life caused by any effort it is usually confused with effort itself or the application of power opera but there is much effort which is merely a mode of recreation or of pleasure the most beautiful actions of the human body and the highest results of the human intelligence are conditions or achievements of quite unlaborious nay of recreative effort but labour is the suffering in effort it is the negative quantity or quantity of defeat which has to be counted against every feat and of defect which has to be counted against every fact or deed of men in brief it is that quantity of our toils which we die in     79 that is to say its only price is its return compare         unto this last p 162 and what follows  we might therefore à priori conjecture as we shall ultimately find that it cannot be bought nor sold everything else is bought and sold for labour but labour itself cannot be bought nor sold for anything being priceless80 the idea that it is a commodity to be bought or sold is the alpha and omega of politicoeconomic fallacy     80 the object of political economy is not to buy nor to sell         labourbut to spare it every attempt to buy or sell it         is in the outcome ineffectualso far as successful it         is not sale but betrayal and the purchase money is a part         of that typical thirty pieces which bought first the         greatest of labours and afterwards the burial field of the         stranger for this purchasemoney being in its very         smallness or vileness the exactly measured opposite of         vilis annona amicorum makes all men strangers to each         other  this being the nature of labour the cost of anything is the quantity of labour necessary to obtain itthe quantity for which or at which it stands constat it is literally the constancy of the thingyou shall win itmove itcome at itfor no less than this  cost is measured and measurable only in labor not in opera81 it does not matter how much power a thing needs to produce it it matters only how much distress generally the more power it requires the less the distress so that the noblest works of man cost less than the meanest     81 ciceros distinction sordidi quæstus quorum operæ non         quorum artes emuntur admirable in principle is inaccurate         in expression because cicero did not practically know how         much operative dexterity is necessary in all the higher         arts but the cost of this dexterity is incalculable be         it great or small the cost of the mere authority and         perfectness of touch in a hammerstroke of donatellos or a         pencil touch of correggios is inestimable by any ordinary         arithmetic the best masters themselves usually estimate it         at sums varying from two to three or four shillings a day         with wine or soup extra  true labour or spending of life is either of the body in fatigue or pain of the temper or heart as in perseverance of search for thingspatience in waiting for themfortitude or degradation in suffering for them and the like or of the intellect all these kinds of labour are supposed to be included in the general term and the quantity of labour is then expressed by the time it lasts so that a unit of labour is an hours work or a days work as we may determine82     82 only observe as some labour is more destructive of life         than other labour the hour or day of the more destructive         toil is supposed to include proportionate rest though men         do not or cannot usually take such rest except in death  cost like value is both intrinsic and effectual intrinsic cost is that of getting the thing in the right way effectual cost is that of getting the thing in the way we set about it but intrinsic cannot be made a subject of analytical investigation being only partially discoverable and that by long experience effectual cost is all that the political economist can deal with that is to say the cost of the thing under existing circumstances and by known processes  cost irrespectively of any question of demand or supply varies with the quantity of the thing wanted and with the number of persons who work for it it is easy to get a little of some things but difficult to get much it is impossible to get some things with few hands but easy to get them with many  the cost and value of things however difficult to determine accurately are thus both dependent on ascertainable physical circumstances83     83 there is therefore observe no such thing as cheapness         in the common use of that term without some error or         injustice a thing is said to be cheap not because it is         common but because it is supposed to be sold under its         worth everything has its proper and true worth at any given         time in relation to everything else and at that worth         should be bought and sold if sold under it it is cheap to         the buyer by exactly so much as the seller loses and no         more putrid meat at twopence a pound is not cheaper         than wholesome meat at sevenpence a pound it is probably         much dearer but if by watching your opportunity you can         get the wholesome meat for sixpence a pound it is cheaper         to you by a penny which you have gained and the seller has         lost the present rage for cheapness is either therefore         simply and literally a rage for badness of all commodities         or it is an attempt to find persons whose necessities will         force them to let you have more than you should for your         money it is quite easy to produce such persons and in         large numbers for the more distress there is in a nation         the more cheapness of this sort you can obtain and your         boasted cheapness is thus merely a measure of the extent of         your national distress          there is indeed a condition of apparent cheapness which         we confuse in practice and in reasoning with the other         namely the real reduction in cost of articles by right         application of labour but in this case the article is only         cheap with reference to its former price the socalled         cheapness is only our expression for the sensation of         contrast between its former and existing prices so soon as         the new methods of producing the article are established it         ceases to be esteemed either cheap or dear at the new         price as at the old one and is felt to be cheap only when         accident enables it to be purchased beneath this new value         and it is to no advantage to produce the article more         easily except as it enables you to multiply your         population cheapness of this kind is merely the discovery         that more men can be maintained on the same ground and the         question how many you will maintain in proportion to your         means remains exactly in the same terms that it did before          a form of immediate cheapness results however in many         cases without distress from the labour of a population         where food is redundant or where the labour by which the         food is produced leaves much idle time on their hands which         may be applied to the production of cheap articles          all such phenomena indicate to the political economist         places where the labour is unbalanced in the first case         the just balance is to be effected by taking labourers from         the spot where the pressure exists and sending them to that         where food is redundant in the second the cheapness is a         local accident advantageous to the local purchaser         disadvantageous to the local producer it is one of the         first duties of commerce to extend the market and thus give         the local producer his full advantage          cheapness caused by natural accidents of harvest weather         etc is always counterbalanced in due time by natural         scarcity similarly caused it is the part of wise         government and healthy commerce so to provide in times and         places of plenty for times and places of dearth as that         there shall never be waste nor famine          cheapness caused by gluts of the market is merely a disease         of clumsy and wanton commerce  but their price is dependent on the human will  such and such a thing is demonstrably good for so much and it may demonstrably be bad for so much  but it remains questionable and in all manner of ways questionable whether i choose to give so much84     84 price has already been defined pp 214 215 to be the         quantity of labour which the possessor of a thing is willing         to take for it it is best to consider the price to be that         fixed by the possessor because the possessor has absolute         power of refusing sale while the purchaser has no absolute         power of compelling it but the effectual or market price is         that at which their estimates coincide  this choice is always a relative one it is a choice to give a price for this rather than for thata resolution to have the thing if getting it does not involve the loss of a better thing price depends therefore not only on the cost of the commodity itself but on its relation to the cost of every other attainable thing  farther the power of choice is also a relative one it depends not merely on our own estimate of the thing but on everybody elses estimate therefore on the number and force of the will of the concurrent buyers and on the existing quantity of the thing in proportion to that number and force  hence the price of anything depends on four variables85    1 its cost   2 its attainable quantity at that cost   3 the number and power of the persons who want it   4 the estimate they have formed of its desirableness  its value only affects its price so far as it is contemplated in this estimate perhaps therefore not at all     85 the two first of these variables are included in the x         and the two last in the y of the formula given at p 162         of unto this last and the four are the radical conditions         which regulate the price of things on first production in         their price in exchange the third and fourth of these         divide each into two others forming the four which are         stated at p 186 of unto this last  now in order to show the manner in which price is expressed in terms of a currency we must assume these four quantities to be known and the estimate of desirableness commonly called the demand to be certain we will take the number of persons at the lowest let a and b be two labourers who demand that is to say have resolved to labour for two articles a and b their demand for these articles if the reader likes better he may say their need is to be absolute existence depending on the getting these two things suppose for instance that they are bread and fuel in a cold country and let a represent the least quantity of bread and b the least quantity of fuel which will support a mans life for a day let a be producible by an hours labour but b only by two hours labour then the cost of a is one hour and of b two cost by our definition being expressible in terms of time if therefore each man worked both for his corn and fuel each would have to work three hours a day but they divide the labour for its greater ease86 then if a works three hours he produces 3a which is one a more than both the men want and if b works three hours he produces only 112b or half of b less than both want but if a works three hours and b six a has 3a and b has 3b a maintenance in the right proportion for both for a day and a half so that each might take a half a days rest but as b has worked double time the whole of this days rest belongs in equity to him therefore the just exchange should be a giving two a for one b has one a and one bmaintenance for a day b giving one b for two a has two a and two bmaintenance for two days     86 this greater ease ought to be allowed for by a diminution         in the times of the divided work but as the proportion of         times would remain the same i do not introduce this         unnecessary complexity into the calculation  but b cannot rest on the second day or a would be left without the article which b produces nor is there any means of making the exchange just unless a third labourer is called in then one workman a produces a and two b and c produce ba working three hours has three ab three hours 112bc three hours 112b b and c each give half of b for a and all have their equal daily maintenance for equal daily work  to carry the example a single step farther let three articles a b and c be needed  let a need one hours work b two and c four then the days work must be seven hours and one man in a days work can make 7a or 312b or 134c therefore one a works for a producing 7a two bs work for b producing 7b four cs work for c producing 7c  a has six a to spare and gives two a for one b and four a for one c each b has 212b to spare and gives 12b for one a and two b for one c each c has 34 of c to spare and gives 12c for one b and 14 of c for one a and all have their days maintenance  generally therefore it follows that if the demand is constant87 the relative prices of things are as their costs or as the quantities of labour involved in production     87 compare unto this last p 177 et seq  then in order to express their prices in terms of a currency we have only to put the currency into the form of orders for a certain quantity of any given article with us it is in the form of orders for gold and all quantities of other articles are priced by the relation they bear to the article which the currency claims  but the worth of the currency itself is not in the slightest degree founded more on the worth of the article for which the gold is exchangeable it is just as accurate to say so many pounds are worth an acre of land as an acre of land is worth so many pounds the worth of gold of land of houses and of food and of all other things depends at any moment on the existing quantities and relative demands for all and each and a change in the worth of or demand for any one involves an instantaneously correspondent change in the worth and demand for all the resta change as inevitable and as accurately balanced though often in its process as untraceable as the change in volume of the outflowing river from some vast lake caused by change in the volume of the inflowing streams though no eye can trace no instrument detect motion either on its surface or in the depth  thus then the real working power or worth of the currency is founded on the entire sum of the relative estimates formed by the population of its possessions a change in this estimate in any direction and therefore every change in the national character instantly alters the value of money in its second great function of commanding labour but we must always carefully and sternly distinguish between this worth of currency dependent on the conceived or appreciated value of what it represents and the worth of it dependent on the existence of what it represents a currency is true or false in proportion to the security with which it gives claim to the possession of land house horse or picture but a currency is strong or weak worth much or worth little in proportion to the degree of estimate in which the nation holds the house horse or picture which is claimed thus the power of the english currency has been till of late largely based on the national estimate of horses and of wine so that a man might always give any price to furnish choicely his stable or his cellar and receive public approval therefor but if he gave the same sum to furnish his library he was called mad or a bibliomaniac and although he might lose his fortune by his horses and his health or life by his cellar and rarely lost either by his books he was yet never called a hippomaniac nor an oinomaniac but only bibliomaniac because the current worth of money was understood to be legitimately founded on cattle and wine but not on literature the prices lately given at sales for pictures and mss indicate some tendency to change in the national character in this respect so that the worth of the currency may even come in time to rest in an acknowledged manner somewhat on the state and keeping of the bedford missal as well as on the health of caractacus or blink bonny and old pictures be considered property no less than old port they might have been so before now but it is more difficult to choose the one than the other  now observe all these sources of variation in the power of the currency exist wholly irrespective of the influences of vice indolence and improvidence we have hitherto supposed throughout the analysis every professing labourer to labour honestly heartily and in harmony with his fellows we have now to bring farther into the calculation the effects of relative industry honour and forethought and thus to follow out the bearings of our second inquiry who are the holders of the store and currency and in what proportions  this however we must reserve for our next papernoticing here only that however distinct the several branches of the subject are radically they are so interwoven in their issues that we cannot rightly treat any one till we have taken cognisance of all thus the quantity of the currency in proportion to number of population is materially influenced by the number of the holders in proportion to the nonholders and this again by the number of holders of goods for as by definition the currency is a claim to goods which are not possessed its quantity indicates the number of claimants in proportion to the number of holders and the force and complexity of claim for if the claims be not complex currency as a means of exchange may be very small in quantity a sells some corn to b receiving a promise from b to pay in cattle which a then hands over to c to get some wine c in due time claims the cattle from b and b takes back his promise these exchanges have or might have been all effected with a single coin or promise and the proportion of the currency to the store would in such circumstances indicate only the circulating vitality of itthat is to say the quantity and convenient divisibility of that part of the store which the habits of the nation keep in circulation if a cattlebreeder is content to live with his household chiefly on meat and milk and does not want rich furniture or jewels or booksif a wine and corngrower maintains himself and his men chiefly on grapes and breadif the wives and daughters of families weave and spin the clothing of the household and the nation as a whole remains content with the produce of its own soil and the work of its own hands it has little occasion for circulating media it pledges and promises little and seldom exchanges only so far as exchange is necessary for life the store belongs to the people in whose hands it is found and money is little needed either as an expression of right or practical means of division and exchange  but in proportion as the habits of the nation become complex and fantastic and they may be both without therefore being civilized its circulating medium must increase in proportion to its store if everyone wants a little of everythingif food must be of many kinds and dress of many fashionsif multitudes live by work which ministering to fancy has its pay measured by fancy so that large prices will be given by one person for what is valueless to anotherif there are great inequalities of knowledge causing great inequalities of estimateand finally and worst of all if the currency itself from its largeness and the power which the possession of it implies becomes the sole object of desire with large numbers of the nation so that the holding of it is disputed among them as the main object of lifein each and all these cases the currency enlarges in proportion to the store and as a means of exchange and division as a bond of right and as an expression of passion plays a more and more important part in the nations dealings character and life  against which part when as a bond of right it becomes too conspicuous and too burdensome the popular voice is apt to be raised in a violent and irrational manner leading to revolution instead of remedy whereas all possibility of economy depends on the clear assertion and maintenance of this bond of right however burdensome the first necessity of all economical government is to secure the unquestioned and unquestionable working of the great law of propertythat a man who works for a thing shall be allowed to get it keep it and consume it in peace and that he who does not eat his cake today shall be seen without grudging to have his cake tomorrow this i say is the first point to be secured by social law without this no political advance nay no political existence is in any sort possible whatever evil luxury iniquity may seem to result from it this is nevertheless the first of all equities and to the enforcement of this by law and by policetruncheon the nation must always primarily set its mindthat the cupboard door may have a firm lock to it and no mans dinner be carried off by the mob on its way home from the bakers which thus fearlessly asserting we shall endeavour in the next paper to consider how far it may be practicable for the mob itself also in due breadth of dish to have dinners to carry home     iii  the currencyholders and storeholders the disease of desire   it will be seen by reference to the last paper that our present task is to examine the relation of holders of store to holders of currency and of both to those who hold neither in order to do this we must determine on which side we are to place substances such as gold commonly known as bases of currency by aid of previous definitions the reader will now be able to understand closer statements than have yet been possible  the currency of any country consists of every document acknowledging debt which is transferable in the country  this transferableness depends upon its intelligibility and credit its intelligibility depends chiefly on the difficulty of forging anything like itits credit much on national character but ultimately always on the existence of substantial means of meeting its demand  as the degrees of transferableness are variable some documents passing only in certain places and others passing if at all for less than their inscribed value both the mass and so to speak fluidity of the currency are variable true or perfect currency flows freely like a pure stream it becomes sluggish or stagnant in proportion to the quantity of less transferable matter which mixes with it adding to its bulk but diminishing its purity substances of intrinsic value such as gold mingle also with the currency and increase while they modify its power these are carried by it as stones are carried by a torrent sometimes momentarily impeding sometimes concentrating its force but not affecting its purity these substances of intrinsic value may be also stamped or signed so as to become acknowledgments of debt and then become so far as they operate independently of their intrinsic value part of the real currency  deferring consideration of minor forms of currency consisting of documents bearing private signature we will examine the principle of legally authorized or national currency  this in its perfect condition is a form of public acknowledgment of debt so regulated and divided that any person presenting a commodity of tried worth in the public market shall if he please receive in exchange for it a document giving him claim for the return of its equivalent 1 in any place 2 at any time and 3 in any kind  when currency is quite healthy and vital the persons entrusted with its management are always able to give on demand either  a the assigning document for the assigned quantity of goods or  b the assigned quantity of goods for the assigning document  if they cannot give document for goods the national exchange is at fault  if they cannot give goods for document the national credit is at fault  the nature and power of the document are therefore to be examined under the three relations which it bears to place time and kind  1 it gives claim to the return of equivalent wealth in any place its use in this function is to save carriage so that parting with a bushel of corn in london we may receive an order for a bushel of corn for the antipodes or elsewhere to be perfect in this use the substance of currency must be to the maximum portable credible and intelligible its nonacceptance or discredit results always from some form of ignorance or dishonour so far as such interruptions rise out of differences in denomination there is no ground for their continuance among civilized nations it may be convenient in one country to use chiefly copper for coinage in another silver and in another goldreckoning accordingly in centimes francs or sequins but that a french franc should be different in weight from an english shilling and an austrian zwanziger vary in weight and alloy from both is wanton loss of commercial power  2 it gives claim to the return of equivalent wealth at any time in this second use currency is the exponent of accumulation it renders the laying up of store at the command of individuals unlimitedly possiblewhereas but for its intervention all gathering would be confined within certain limits by the bulk of poverty or by its decay or the difficulty of its guardianship i will pull down my barns and build greater cannot be a daily saying and all material investment is enlargement of care the national currency transfers the guardianship of the store to many and preserves to the original producer the right of reentering on its possession at any future period  3 it gives claim practical though not legal to the return of equivalent wealth in any kind it is a transferable right not merely to this or that but to anything and its power in this function is proportioned to the range of choice if you give a child an apple or a toy you give him a determinate pleasure but if you give him a penny an indeterminate one proportioned to the range of selection offered by the shops in the village the power of the worlds currency is similarly in proportion to the openness of the worlds fair and commonly enhanced by the brilliancy of external aspect rather than solidity of its wares  we have said that the currency consists of orders for equivalent goods if equivalent their quality must be guaranteed the kinds of goods chosen for specific claim must therefore be capable of test while also that a store may be kept in hand to meet the call of the currency smallness of bulk with great relative value is desirable and indestructibility over at least a certain period essential  such indestructibility and facility of being tested are united in gold its intrinsic value is great and its imaginary value is greater so that partly through indolence partly through necessity and want of organization most nations have agreed to take gold for the only basis of their currencieswith this grave disadvantage that its portability enabling the metal to become an active part of the medium of exchange the stream of the currency itself becomes opaque with goldhalf currency and half commodity in unison of functions which partly neutralize partly enhance each others force  they partly neutralize since in so far as the gold is commodity it is bad currency because liable to sale and in so far as it is currency it is bad commodity because its exchange value interferes with its practical use especially its employment in the higher branches of the arts becomes unsafe on account of its liability to be melted down for exchange  again they partly enhance since in so far as the gold has acknowledged intrinsic value it is good currency because everywhere acceptable and in so far as it has legal exchangeable value its worth as a commodity is increased we want no gold in the form of dust or crystal but we seek for it coined because in that form it will pay baker and butcher and this worth in exchange not only absorbs a large quantity in that use88 but greatly increases the effect on the imagination of the quantity used in the arts thus in brief the force of the functions is increased but their precision blunted by their unison     88 the waste of labour in obtaining the gold though it cannot         be estimated by help of any existing data may be understood         in its bearing on entire economy by supposing it limited to         transactions between two persons if two farmers in         australia have been exchanging corn and cattle with each         other for years keeping their accounts of reciprocal debt         in any simple way the sum of the possessions of either         would not be diminished though the part of it which was         lent or borrowed were only reckoned by marks on a stone or         notches on a tree and the one counted himself accordingly         so many scratches or so many notches better than the         other but it would soon be seriously diminished if         discovering gold in their fields each resolved only to         accept golden counters for a reckoning and accordingly         whenever he wanted a sack of corn or a cow was obliged to         go and wash sand for a week before he could get the means of         giving a receipt for them  these inconveniences however attach to gold as a basis of currency on account of its portability and preciousness but a far greater inconvenience attaches to it as the only legal basis of currency imagine gold to be only attainable in masses weighing several pounds each and its value like that of a malachite or marble proportioned to its largeness of bulkit could not then get itself confused with the currency in daily use but it might still remain as its basis and this second inconvenience would still affect it namely that its significance as an expression of debt varies as that of every other article would with the popular estimate of its desirableness and with the quantity offered in the market my power of obtaining other goods for gold depends always on the strength of public passion for gold and on the limitation of its quantity so that when either of two things happenthat the world esteems gold less or finds it more easilymy right of claim is in that degree effaced and it has been even gravely maintained that a discovery of a mountain of gold would cancel the national debt in other words that men may be paid for what costs much in what costs nothing now if it is true that there is little chance of sudden convulsion in this respect the world will not rapidly increase in wisdom so as to despise gold and perhaps may even desire it more eagerly the more easily it is obtained nevertheless the right of debt ought not to rest on a basis of imagination nor should the frame of a national currency vibrate with every misers panic and every merchants imprudence  there are two methods of avoiding this insecurity which would have been fallen upon long ago if instead of calculating the conditions of the supply of gold men had only considered how the world might live and manage its affairs without gold at all89 one is to base the currency on substances of truer intrinsic value the other to base it on several substances instead of one if i can only claim gold the discovery of a continent of cornfields need not trouble me if however i wish to exchange my bread for other things a good harvest will for the time limit my power in this respect but if i can claim either bread iron or silk at pleasure the standard of value has three feet instead of one and will be proportionally firm thus ultimately the steadiness of currency depends upon the breadth of its base but the difficulty of organization increasing with this breadth the discovery of the condition at once safest and most convenient90 can only be by long analysis which must for the present be deferred gold or silver91 may always be retained in limited use as a luxury of coinage and questionless standard of one weight and alloy among nations varying only in the die the purity of coinage when metallic is closely indicative of the honesty of the system of revenue and even of the general dignity of the state92     89 it is difficult to estimate the curious futility of         discussions such as that which lately occupied a section of         the british association on the absorption of gold while no         one can produce even the simplest of the data necessary for         the inquiry to take the first occurring onewhat means         have we of ascertaining the weight of gold employed this         year in the toilettes of the women of europe not to         speak of asia and supposing it known what means of         conjecturing the weight by which next year their fancies         and the changes of style among their jewellers will         diminish or increase it     90 see in popes epistle to lord bathurst his sketch of the         difficulties and uses of a currency literally pecuniary            his grace will gameto whites a bull he led etc     91 perhaps both perhaps silver only it may be found         expedient ultimately to leave gold free for use in the arts         as a means of reckoning the standard might be and in some         cases has already been entirely idealsee mills         political economy book iii chap 7 at beginning     92 the purity of the drachma and sequin were not without         significance of the state of intellect art and policy         both in athens and venicea fact first impressed upon         me ten years ago when in daguerreotypes of venetian         architecture i found no purchasable gold pure enough         to gild them with but that of the old venetian sequin  whatever the article or articles may be which the national currency promises to pay a premium on that article indicates bankruptcy of the government in that proportion the division of the assets being restrained only by the remaining confidence of the holders of notes in the return of prosperity to the firm incontrovertible currencies those of forced acceptance or of unlimited issue are merely various modes of disguising taxation and delaying its pressure until it is too late to interfere with its causes to do away with the possibility of such disguise would have been among the first results of a true economical science had any such existed but there have been too many motives for the concealment so long as it could by any artifices be maintained to permit hitherto even the founding of such a science  and indeed it is only through evil conduct wilfully persisted in that there is any embarrassment either in the theory or the working of currency no exchequer is ever embarrassed nor is any financial question difficult of solution when people keep their practice honest and their heads cool but when governments lose all office of pilotage protection scrutiny and witness and live only in magnificence of proclaimed larceny effulgent mendacity and polished mendicity or when the people choosing speculation the s

sand of phlegethonquicksand at the embouchureland fluently recommended by recent auctioneers as eligible for building leases  finally then the power of true currency is fourfold  1 credit power its worth in exchange dependent on public opinion of the stability and honesty of the issuer  2 real worth supposing the gold or whatever else the currency expressly promises to be required from the issuer for all his notes and that the call cannot be met in full then the actual worth of the document whatever its credit power would be and its actual worth at any moment is to be defined as being what the division of the assets of the issuer and his subsequent will work would produce for it  3 the exchange power of its base granting that we can get five pounds in gold for our note it remains a question how much of other things we can get for five pounds in gold the more of other things exist and the less gold the greater this power  4 the power over labour exercised by the given quantity of the base or of the things to be got for it the question in this case is how much work and question of questions whose work is to be had for the food which five pounds will buy this depends on the number of the population on their gifts and on their dispositions with which down to their slightest humours and up to their strongest impulses the power of the currency varies and in this last of its rangesthe range of passion price or praise converso in pretium deo is at once least and greatest  such being the main conditions of national currency we proceed to examine those of the total currency under the broad definition transferable acknowledgment of debt93 among the many forms of which there are in effect only two distinctly opposed namely the acknowledgments of debts which will be paid and of debts which will not documents whether in whole or part of bad debt being to those of good debt as bad money to bullion we put for the present these forms of imposture aside as in analysing a metal we should wash it clear of dross and then range in their exact quantities the true currency of the country on one side and the store or property of the country on the other we place gold and all such substances on the side of documents as far as they operate by signatureon the side of store as far as they operate by value then the currency represents the quantity of debt in the country and the store the quantity of its possession the ownership of all the property is divided between the holders of currency and holders of store and whatever the claiming value of the currency is at any moment that value is to be deducted from the riches of the storeholders the deduction being practically made in the payment of rent for houses and lands of interest on stock and in other ways to be hereafter examined     93 under which term observe we include all documents of debt         which being honest might be transferable though they         practically are not transferred while we exclude all         documents which are in reality worthless though in fact         transferred temporarily as bad money is the document of         honest debt not transferred is merely to paper currency as         gold withdrawn from circulation is to that of bullion much         confusion has crept into the reasoning on this subject from         the idea that withdrawal from circulation is a definable         state whereas it is a gradated state and indefinable the         sovereign in my pocket is withdrawn from circulation as long         as i choose to keep it there it is no otherwise withdrawn         if i bury it nor even if i choose to make it and others         into a golden cup and drink out of them since a rise in         the price of the wine or of other things may at any time         cause me to melt the cup and throw it back into currency         and the bullion operates on the prices of the things in the         market as directly though not as forcibly while it is in         the form of a cup as it does in the form of a sovereign no         calculation can be founded on my humour in any ease if i         like to handle rouleaus and therefore keep a quantity of         gold to play with in the form of jointed basaltic columns         it is all one in its effect on the market as if i kept it in         the form of twisted filigree or steadily amicus lamnæ beat         the narrow gold pieces into broad ones and dined off them         the probability is greater that i break the rouleau than         that i melt the plate but the increased probability is not         calculable thus documents are only withdrawn from the         currency when cancelled and bullion when it is so         effectually lost as that the probability of finding it is no         greater than that of finding new gold in the mine  at present i wish only to note the broad relations of the two great classesthe currencyholders and storeholders94 of course they are partly united most monied men having possessions of land or other goods but they are separate in their nature and functions the currencyholders as a class regulate the demand for labour and the storeholders the laws of it the currencyholders determine what shall be produced and the storeholders the conditions of its production farther as true currency represents by definition debts which will be paid it represents either the debtors wealth or his ability and willingness that is to say either wealth existing in his hands transferred to him by the creditor or wealth which as he is at some time surely to return it he is either increasing or if diminishing has the will and strength to reproduce a sound currency therefore as by its increase it represents enlarging debt represents also enlarging means but in this curious way that a certain quantity of it marks the deficiency of the wealth of the country from what it would have been if that currency had not existed95 in this respect it is like the detritus of a mountain assume that it lies at a fixed angle and the more the detritus the larger must be the mountain but it would have been larger still had there been none     94 they are up to the amount of the currency simply creditors         and debtorsthe commercial types of the two great sects of         humanity which those words describe for debt and credit are         of course merely the mercantile forms of the words duty         and creed which give the central ideas only it is more         accurate to say faith than creed because creed has been         applied carelessly to mere forms of words duty properly         signifies whatever in substance or act one person owes to         another and faith the others trust in his rendering it         the french devoir and foi are fuller and clearer words         than ours for faith being the passive of fact foi comes         straight through fides from fio and the french keep the         group of words formed from the infinitivefieri se fier         se défier défiance and the grand following défi our         english affiance defiance confidence diffidence         retain accurate meanings but our faithful has become         obscure from being used for faithworthy as well as full         of faith his name that sat on him was called faithful and         true          trust is the passive of true saying as faith is the passive         of due doing and the right learning of these etymologies         which are in the strictest sense only to be learned by         heart is of considerably more importance to the youth of a         nation than its reading and ciphering     95 for example suppose an active peasant having got his         ground into good order and built himself a comfortable         house finding still time on his hands sees one of his         neighbours little able to work and ill lodged and offers         to build him also a house and to put his land in order on         condition of receiving for a given period rent for the         building and tithe of the fruits the offer is accepted and         a document given promissory of rent and tithe this note is         money it can only be good money if the man who has incurred         the debt so far recovers his strength as to be able to take         advantage of the help he has received and meet the demand         of the note if he lets his house fall to ruin and his         field to waste his promissory note will soon be valueless         but the existence of the note at all is a consequence of his         not having worked so stoutly as the other let him gain as         much as to be able to pay back the entire debt the note is         cancelled and we have two rich storeholders and no         currency  finally though as above stated every man possessing money has usually also some property beyond what is necessary for his immediate wants and men possessing property usually also hold currency beyond what is necessary for their immediate exchanges it mainly determines the class to which they belong whether in their eyes the money is an adjunct of the property or the property of the money in the first case the holders pleasure is in his possessions and in his money subordinately as the means of bettering or adding to them in the second his pleasure is in his money and in his possessions only as representing it in the first case the money is as an atmosphere surrounding the wealth rising from it and raining back upon it but in the second it is a deluge with the wealth floating and for the most part perishing in it the shortest distinction between the men is that the one wishes always to buy and the other to sell  such being the great relations of the classes their several characters are of the highest importance to the nation for on the character of the storeholders depends the preservation display and serviceableness of its wealthon that of the currencyholders its nature and in great part its distribution and on both its production  the storeholders are either constructive or neutral or destructive and in subsequent papers we shall with respect to every kind of wealth examine the relative power of the storeholder for its improvement or destruction and we shall then find it to be of incomparably greater importance to the nation in whose hands the thing is put than how much of it is got and that the character of the holders may be conjectured by the quality of the store for such and such a thing nor only asks for it but if to be bettered betters it so that possession and possessor reciprocally act on each other through the entire sum of national possession the base nation asking for base things sinks daily to deeper vileness of nature and of use while the noble nation asking for noble things rises daily into diviner eminence in both the tendency to degradation being surely marked by greek ataxia carelessness as to the hands in which things are put competition for the acquisition of them disorderliness in accumulation inaccuracy in reckoning and bluntness in conception as to the entire nature of possession  now the currencyholders always increase in number and influence in proportion to the bluntness of nature and clumsiness of the storeholders for the less use people can make of things the more they tire of them and want to change them for something else and all frequency of change increases the quantity and power of currency while the large currencyholder himself is essentially a person who never has been able to make up his mind as to what he will have and proceeds therefore in vague collection and aggregation with more and more infuriate passion urged by complacency in progress and pride in conquest  while however there is this obscurity in the nature of possession of currency there is a charm in the absoluteness of it which is to some people very enticing in the enjoyment of real property others must partly share the groom has some enjoyment of the stud and the gardener of the garden but the money is or seems shut up it is wholly enviable no one else can have part in any complacencies arising from it  the power of arithmetical comparison is also a great thing to unimaginative people they know always they are so much better than they were in money so much better than others in money wit cannot be so compared nor character my neighbour cannot be convinced i am wiser than he is but he can that i am worth so much more and the universality of the conviction is no less flattering than its clearness only a few can understand none measure superiorities in other things but everybody can understand money and count it  now these various temptations to accumulation would be politically harmless if what was vainly accumulated had any fair chance of being wisely spent for as accumulation cannot go on for ever but must some day end in its reverseif this reverse were indeed a beneficial distribution and use as irrigation from reservoir the fever of gathering though perilous to the gatherer might be serviceable to the community but it constantly happens so constantly that it may be stated as a political law having few exceptions that what is unreasonably gathered is also unreasonably spent by the persons into whose hands it finally falls very frequently it is spent in war or else in stupefying luxury twice hurtful both in being indulged by the rich and witnessed by the poor so that the mal tener and mal dare are as correlative as complementary colours and the circulation of wealth which ought to be soft steady strong farsweeping and full of warmth like the gulf stream being narrowed into an eddy and concentrated on a point changes into the alternate suction and surrender of charybdis which is indeed i doubt not the true meaning of that marvellous fable infinite as bacon said of it in matter of meditation96     96 it is a strange habit of wise humanity to speak in enigmas         only so that the highest truths and usefullest laws must be         hunted for through whole picturegalleries of dreams which         to the vulgar seem dreams only thus homer the greek         tragedians plato dante chaucer shakespeare and goethe         have hidden all that is chiefly serviceable in their work         and in all the various literature they absorbed and         reembodied under types which have rendered it quite         useless to the multitude what is worse the two primal         declarers of moral discovery homer and plato are partly at         issue for platos logical power quenched his imagination         and he became incapable of understanding the purely         imaginative element either in poetry or painting he         therefore somewhat overrates the pure discipline of         passionate art in song and music and misses that of         meditative art there is however a deeper reason for his         distrust of homer his love of justice and reverently         religious nature made him dread as death every form of         fallacy but chiefly fallacy respecting the world to come         his own myths being only symbolic exponents of a rational         hope we shall perhaps now every day discover more clearly         how right plato was in this and feel ourselves more and         more wonderstruck that men such as homer and dante and in         an inferior sphere milton not to speak of the great         sculptors and painters of every age have permitted         themselves though full of all nobleness and wisdom to coin         idle imaginations of the mysteries of eternity and mould         the faiths of the families of the earth by the courses of         their own vague and visionary arts while the indisputable         truths respecting human life and duty respecting which they         all have but one voice lie hidden behind these veils of         phantasy unsought and often unsuspected i will gather         carefully out of dante and homer what of this kind bears         on our subject in its due place the first broad intention         of their symbols may be sketched at once the rewards of a         worthy use of riches subordinate to other ends are shown         by dante in the fifth and sixth orbs of paradise for the         punishment of their unworthy use three places are assigned         one for the avaricious and prodigal whose souls are lost         hell canto 7 one for the avaricious and prodigal whose         souls are capable of purification purgatory canto 19         and one for the usurers of whom none can be redeemed         hell canto 17 the first group the largest in all hell         gente piu che altrove troppa meet in contrary currents         as the waves of charybdis casting weights at each other         from opposite sides this weariness of contention is the         chief element of their torture so marked by the beautiful         lines beginning or puoi figliuol etc but the usurers         who made their money inactively sit on the sand equally         without rest however di qua di la soccorrien etc         for it is not avarice but contention for riches leading to         this double misuse of them which in dantes sight is the         unredeemable sin the place of its punishment is guarded by         plutus the great enemy and la fièra crudele a spirit         quite different from the greek plutus who though old and         blind is not cruel and is curable so as to become         farsighted greek hou typhlos all oxy blepônplatos         epithets in first book of the laws still more does this         dantesque type differ from the resplendent plutus of goethe         in the second part of faust who is the personified power         of wealth for good or evil not the passion for wealth and         again from the plutus of spenser who is the passion of mere         aggregation dantes plutus is specially and definitely the         spirit of contention and competition or evil commerce and         because as i showed in my last paper this kind of commerce         makes all men strangers his speech is unintelligible and         no single soul of all those ruined by him has recognizable         features            la sconescente vita           ad ogni conoscenza or li fa bruni          on the other hand the redeemable sins of avarice and         prodigality are in dantes sight those which are without         deliberate or calculated operation the lust or lavishness         of riches can be purged so long as there has been no         servile consistency of dispute and competition for them the         sin is spoken of as that of degradation by the love of         earth it is purified by deeper humiliationthe souls crawl         on their bellies their chant my soul cleaveth unto the         dust but the spirits here condemned are all recognizable         and even the worst examples of the thirst for gold which         they are compelled to tell the histories of during the         night are of men swept by the passion of avarice into         violent crime but not sold to

the wheels of the         greater fortune of which the constellation is ascending         when dantes dream begins compare george herbert                                  lift up thy head

punishment an evil spirit is seen by dante quite other         than the gran nemico the great enemy is obeyed knowingly         and willingly but this spiritfeminineand called a         sirenis the deceitfulness of riches greek apatê         ploutou of the gospels winning obedience by guile this is         the idol of riches made doubly phantasmal by dantes seeing         her in a dream she is lovely to look upon and enchants by         her sweet singing but her womb is loathsome now dante         does not call her one of the sirens carelessly any more         than he speaks of charybdis carelessly and though he had         only got at the meaning of the homeric fable through         virgils obscure tradition of it the clue he has given us         is quite enough bacons interpretation the sirens or         pleasures which has become universal since his time is         opposed alike to platos meaning and homers the sirens are         not pleasures but desires in the odyssey they are the         phantoms of vain desire but in platos vision of destiny         phantoms of constant desire singing each a different note         on the circles of the distaff of necessity but forming one         harmony to which the three great fates put words dante         however adopted the homeric conception of them which was         that they were demons of the imagination not carnal desire         of the eyes not lust of the flesh therefore said to be         daughters of the muses yet not of the muses heavenly or         historical but of the muse of pleasure and they are at         first winged because even vain hope excites and helps when         first formed but afterwards contending for the possession         of the imagination with the muses themselves they are         deprived of their wings and thus we are to distinguish the         siren power from the power of circe who is no daughter of         the muses but of the strong elements sun and sea her         power is that of frank and full vital pleasure which if         governed and watched nourishes men but unwatched and         having no moly bitterness or delay mixed with it turns         men into beasts but does not slay them leaves them on the         contrary power of revival she is herself indeed an         enchantresspure animal life transformingor         degradingbut always wonderful she puts the stores on

right nourishmentpramnian wine cheese and flour that is         corn milk and wine the three great sustainers of lifeit         is their own fault if these make swine of them and swine         are chosen merely as the type of consumption as platos         greek huôn polis in the second book of the polity and         perhaps chosen by homer with a deeper knowledge of the         likeness of nourishment and internal form of body et quel         est sil vous plaît cet audacieux animal qui se permet         dêtre bâti au dedans comme une jolie petite fille          hélas chère enfant jai

et cest         toujours une consolation histoire dune bouchée de         pain lettre ix but the deadly sirens are all things         opposed to the circean power they promise pleasure but         never give it they nourish in no wise but slay by slow         death and whereas they corrupt the heart and the head         instead of merely betraying the senses there is no recovery         from their power they do not tear nor snatch like scylla         but the men who have listened to them are poisoned and         waste away note that the sirens field is covered not         merely with the bones but with the skins of those who have         been consumed there they address themselves in the part of         the song which homer gives not to the passions of ulysses         but to his vanity and the only man who ever came within         hearing of them and escaped untempted was orpheus who         silenced the vain imaginations by singing the praises of the         gods          it is then one of these sirens whom dante takes as the         phantasm or deceitfulness of riches but note further that         she says it was her song that deceived ulysses look back to         dantes account of ulysses death and we find it was not         the love of money but pride of knowledge that betrayed         him whence we get the clue to dantes complete meaning         that the souls whose love of wealth is pardonable have been         first deceived into pursuit of it by a dream of its higher         uses or by ambition his siren is therefore the philotimé         of spenser daughter of mammon            whom all that folk with such contention           do flock about my deare my daughter is           honour and dignitie from her alone           derived are          by comparing spensers entire account of this philotimé with         dantes of the wealthsiren we shall get at the full         meaning of both poets but that of homer lies hidden much         more deeply for his sirens are indefinite and they are         desires of any evil thing power of wealth is not specially         indicated by him until escaping the harmonious danger of         imagination ulysses has to choose between two practical         ways of life indicated by the two rocks of scylla and         charybdis the monsters that haunt them are quite distinct         from the rocks themselves which having many other         subordinate significations are in the main labour and         idleness or getting and spending each with its attendant         monster or betraying demon the rock of gaining has its         summit in the clouds invisible and not to be climbed that         of spending is low but marked by the cursed figtree which         has leaves but no fruit we know the type elsewhere and         there is a curious lateral allusion to it by dante when         jacopo di sant andrea who had ruined himself by profusion         and committed suicide scatters the leaves of the bush of         lotto degli agli endeavouring to hide himself among them         we shall hereafter examine the type completely here i will         only give an approximate rendering of homers words which         have been obscured more by translation than even by         tradition          they are overhanging rocks the great waves of blue water         break round them and the blessed gods call them the         wanderers          by one of them no winged thing can passnot even the wild         doves that bring ambrosia to their father jovebut the         smooth rock seizes its sacrifice of them not even         ambrosia to be had without labour the word is peculiaras         a part of anything offered for sacrifice especially used of         heaveoffering it reaches the wide heaven with its top         and a darkblue cloud rests on it and never passes neither         does the clear sky hold it in summer nor in harvest nor can         any man climb itnot if he had twenty feet and hands for         it is smooth as though it were hewn          and in the midst of it is a cave which is turned the way of         hell and therein dwells scylla whining for prey her cry         indeed is no louder than that of a newlyborn whelp but         she herself is an awful thingnor can any creature see her         face and be glad no though it were a god that rose against         her for she has twelve feet all forefeet and six necks         and terrible heads on them and each has three rows of         teeth full of black death          but the opposite rock is lower than this though but a         bowshot distant and upon it there is a great figtree         full of leaves and under it the terrible charybdis sucks it         down and thrice casts it up again be not thou there when         she sucks down for neptune himself could not save thee          the reader will find the meaning of these types gradually         elicited as we proceed  this disease of desire having especial relation to the great art of exchange or commerce we must in order to complete our code of first principles shortly state the nature and limits of that art  as the currency conveys right of choice out of many things in exchange for one so commerce is the agency by which the power of choice is obtained and countries producing only timber can obtain for their timber silk and gold or naturally producing only jewels and frankincense can obtain for them cattle and corn in this function commerce is of more importance to a country in proportion to the limitations of its products and the restlessness of its fancygenerally of greater importance towards northern latitudes  commerce is necessary however not only to exchange local products but local skill labour requiring the agency of fire can only be given abundantly in cold countries labour requiring suppleness of body and sensitiveness of touch only in warm ones labour involving accurate vivacity of thought only in temperate ones while peculiar imaginative actions are produced by extremes of heat and cold and of light and darkness the production of great art is limited to climates warm enough to admit of repose in the open air and cool enough to render such repose delightful minor variations in modes of skill distinguish every locality the labour which at any place is easiest is in that place cheapest and it becomes often desirable that products raised in one country should be wrought in another hence have arisen discussions on international values which will be one day remembered as highly curious exercises of the human mind for it will be discovered in due course of tide and time that international value is regulated just as interprovincial or interparishional value is coals and hops are exchanged between northumberland and kent on absolutely the same principles as iron and wine between lancashire and spain the greater breadth of an arm of the sea increases the cost but does not modify the principle of exchange and a bargain written in two languages will have no other economical results than a bargain written in one the distances of nations are measured not by seas but by ignorances and their divisions determined not by dialects but by enmities  of course a system of international values may always be constructed if we assume a relation of moral law to physical geography as for instance that it is right to cheat across a river though not across a road or across a lake though not across a river or over a mountain though not across a lake etcagain a system of such values may be constructed by assuming similar relations of taxation to physical geography as for instance that an article should be taxed in crossing a river but not in crossing a road or in being carried over a mountain but not over a ferry etc such positions are indeed not easily maintained when once put in logical form but one law of international value is maintainable in any form namely that the farther your neighbour lives from you and the less he understands you the more you are bound to be true in your dealings with him because your power over him is greater in proportion to his ignorance and his remedy more difficult in proportion to his distance  i have just said the breadth of sea increases the cost of exchange exchange or commerce as such is always costly the sum of the value of the goods being diminished by the cost of their conveyance and by the maintenance of the persons employed in it so that it is only when there is advantage to both producers in getting the one thing for the other greater than the loss in conveyance that the exchange is expedient and it is only justly conducted when the porters kept by the producers commonly called merchants look only for pay and not for profit for in just commerce there are but three partiesthe two persons or societies exchanging and the agent or agents of exchange the value of the things to be exchanged is known by both the exchangers and each receives equivalent value neither gaining nor losing for whatever one gains the other loses the intermediate agent is paid an equal and known percentage by both partly for labour in conveyance partly for care knowledge and risk every attempt at concealment of the amount of the pay indicates either effort on the part of the agent to obtain exorbitant percentage or effort on the part of the exchangers to refuse him a just one but for the most part it is the first namely the effort on the part of the merchant to obtain larger profit so called by buying cheap and selling dear some part indeed of this larger gain is deserved and might be openly demanded because it is the reward of the merchants knowledge and foresight of probable necessity but the greater part of such gain is unjust and unjust in this most fatal way that it depends first on keeping the exchangers ignorant of the exchange value of the articles and secondly on taking advantage of the buyers need and the sellers poverty it is therefore one of the essential and quite the most fatal forms of usury for usury means merely taking an exorbitant sum for the use of anything and it is no matter whether the exorbitance is on loan or exchange in rent or in pricethe essence of the usury being that it is obtained by advantage of opportunity or necessity and not as due reward for labour all the great thinkers therefore have held it to be unnatural and impious in so far as it feeds on the distress of others or their folly97 nevertheless attempts to repress it by law in other words to regulate prices by law so far as their variations depend on iniquity and not on nature must for ever be ineffective though plato bacon and the first napoleonall three of them men who knew somewhat more of humanity than the british merchant usually doestried their hands at it and have left some probably good moderative forms of law which we will examine in their place but the only final check upon it must be radical purifying of the national character for being as bacon calls it concessum propter duritiem cordis it is to be done away with by touching the heart only not however without medicinal lawas in the case of the other permission propter duritiem but in this more than in anything though much in all and though in this he would not himself allow of their application for his own laws against usury are sharp enough platos words are true in the fourth book of the polity that neither drugs nor charms nor burnings will touch a deeplying political sore any more than a deep bodily one but only right and utter change of constitution and that they do but lose their labour who think that by any tricks of law they can get the better of these mischiefs of intercourse and see not that they hew at a hydra     97 hence dantes companionship of cahors inf canto xi         supported by the view taken of the matter throughout the         middle ages in common with the greeks  and indeed this hydra seems so unslayable and sin sticks so fast between the joinings of the stones of buying and selling that to trade in things or literally crossgive them has warped itself by the instinct of nations into their worst word for fraud for because in trade there cannot but be trust and it seems also that there cannot but also be injury in answer to it what is merely fraud between enemies becomes treachery among friends and trader traditor and traitor are but the same word for which simplicity of language there is more reason than at first appears for as in true commerce there is no profit so in true commerce there is no sale the idea of sale is that of an interchange between enemies respectively endeavouring to get the better of one another but commerce is an exchange between friends and there is no desire but that it should be just any more than there would be between members of the same family the moment there is a bargain over the pottage the family relation is dissolvedtypically the days of mourning for my father are at hand whereupon follows the resolve then will i slay my brother  this inhumanity of mercenary commerce is the more notable because it is a fulfilment of the law that the corruption of the best is the worst for as taking the body natural for symbol of the body politic the governing and forming powers may be likened to the brain and the labouring to the limbs the mercantile presiding over circulation and communication of things in changed utilities is symbolized by the heart which if it harden all is lost and this is the ultimate lesson which the leader of english intellect meant for us a lesson indeed not all his own but part of the old wisdom of humanity in the tale of the merchant of venice in which the true and incorrupt merchantkind and free beyond every other shakespearian conception of menis opposed to the corrupted merchant or usurer the lesson being deepened by the expression of the strange hatred which the corrupted merchant bears to the pure one mixed with intense scorn  this is the fool that lent out money gratis look to him jailor as to lunatic no less than criminal the enmity observe having its symbolism literally carried out by being aimed straight at the heart and finally foiled by a literal appeal to the great moral law that flesh and blood cannot be weighed enforced by portia portion the type of divine fortune98 found not in gold nor in silver but in lead that is to say in endurance and patience not in splendour and finally taught by her lips also declaring instead of the law and quality of merces the greater law and quality of mercy which is not strained but drops as the rain blessing him that gives and him that takes and observe that this mercy is not the mean misericordia but the mighty gratia answered by gratitude observe shylocks leaning on the to him detestable word gratis and compare the relation of grace to equity given in the second chapter of the second book of the memorabilia that is to say it is the gracious or loving instead of the strained or competing manner of doing things answered not only with merces or pay but with merci or thanks and this is indeed the meaning of the great benediction grace mercy and peace for there can be no peace without grace not even by help of rifled cannon99 nor even without triplicity of graciousness for the greeks who began with but one grace had to open their scheme into three before they had done     98 shakespeare would certainly never have chosen this name had         he been forced to retain the

give graciousness to deed the other loveliness arising naturally out of that in which function charis becomes charitas100 and has a name and praise even greater than that of faith or truth for these may be maintained sullenly and proudly but charis101 is in her countenance always gladdening aglaia and in her service instant and humble and the true wife of vulcan or labour and it is not until her sincerity of function is lost and her mere beauty contemplated instead of her patience that she is born again of the foam flake and becomes aphrodité then only capable of joining herself to war and to the enmities of men instead of to labour and their services therefore the fable of mars and venus is chosen by homer picturing himself as demodocus to sing at the games in the court of alcinous phæacia is the homeric island of atlantis an image of noble and wise government concealed how slightly merely by the change of a short vowel for a long one in the name of its queen yet misunderstood by all later writers even by horace in his pinguis phæaxque etc that fable expresses the perpetual error of men thinking that grace and dignity can only be reached by the soldier and never by the artizan so that commerce and the useful arts have had the honour and beauty taken away and only the fraud102 and pain left to them with the lucre which is indeed one great reason of the continual blundering about the offices of government with respect to commerce the higher classes are ashamed to deal with it and though ready enough to fight for or occasionally against the peopleto preach to

        reasoning depend on the work thus done in the outset but         we may sometimes gain more by insistence on the expression         of a truth than by much wordless thinking about it for         to strive to express it clearly is often to detect it         thoroughly and education even as regards thought nearly         sums itself in making men economise their words and         understand them nor is it possible to estimate the harm         that has been done in matters of higher speculation and         conduct by loose verbiage though we may guess at it by         observing the dislike which people show to having anything         about their religion said to them in simple words because         then they understand it thus congregations meet weekly to         invoke the influence of a spirit of life and truth yet if         any part of that character were intelligibly expressed to         them by the formulas of the service they would be offended         suppose for instance in the closing benediction the         clergyman were to give its vital significance to the word         holy and were to say the fellowship of the helpful and         honest ghost be with you and remain with you always what         would be the horror of many first at the irreverence of so         intelligible an expression and secondly at the         discomfortable entry of the suspicion that while throughout         the commercial dealings of the week they had denied the         propriety of help and possibility of honesty the person         whose company they had been

wholly inapplicable         to matters of private interest it is not true that honesty         as far as material gain is concerned profits individuals a         clever and cruel knave will in a mixed

knaves in it to live         at the expense of honest people while there is for every         act of fraud however small a loss of wealth to the         community whatever the fraudulent person gains some other         person loses as fraud produces nothing and there is         besides the loss of the time and thought spent in         accomplishing the fraud and of the strength otherwise

usually understood by liberty in modern language indeed much more like what some people would call slavery for a greek always understood primarily by liberty deliverance from the law of his own passions or from what the christian writers call bondage of corruption and this a complete liberty not having to resist the passion but making it fawn upon and follow himthis may be again partly the meaning of the fawning beasts about the circean cave so again george herbert    correct thy passions spite   then may the beasts draw thee to happy light  not being merely safe from the siren but also unbound from the mast and it is only in such generosity that any man becomes capable of so governing others as to take true part in any system of national economy nor is there any other eternal distinction between the upper and lower classes than this form of liberty eleutheria or benignity in the one and its opposite of slavery douleia or malignity in the other the separation of these two orders of men and the firm government of the lower by the higher being the first conditions of possible wealth and economy in any statethe gods giving it no greater gift than the power to discern its freemen and malignum spernere vulgus  the examination of this form of charis must therefore lead us into the discussion of the principles of government in general and especially of that of the poor by the rich discovering how the graciousness joined with the greatness or love with majestas is the true dei gratia or divine right of every form and manner of king ie specifically of the thrones

encheirê chrêsthai zêmia esti     iv  laws and governments labour and riches   it remains in order to complete the series of our definitions that we examine the general conditions of government and fix the sense in which we are to use in future the terms applied to them  the government of a state consists in its customs laws and councils and their enforcements   icustoms  as one person primarily differs from another by fineness of nature and secondarily by fineness of training so also a polite nation differs from a savage one first by the refinement of its nature and secondly by the delicacy of its customs  in the completeness or accomplishment of custom which is the nations selfgovernment there are three stagesfirst fineness in method of doing or of beingcalled the manner or moral of acts secondly firmness in holding such method after adoption so that it shall become a habit in the character ie a constant having or behaving and lastly practice or ethical power in performance and endurance which is the skill following on habit and the ease reached by frequency of right doing  the sensibility of the nation is indicated by the fineness of its customs its courage patience and temperance by its persistence in them  by sensibility i mean its natural perception of beauty fitness and rightness or of what is lovely decent and just faculties dependent much on race and the primal signs of fine breeding in man but cultivable also by education and necessary perishing without it true education has indeed no other function than the development of these faculties and of the relative will it has been the great error of modern intelligence to mistake science for education you do not educate a man by telling him what he knew not but by making him what he was not  and making him what he will remain for ever for no wash of weeds will bring back the faded purple and in that dyeing there are two processesfirst the cleansing and wringing out which is the baptism with water and then the infusing of the blue and scarlet colours gentleness and justice which is the baptism with fire  the customs and manners of a sensitive and highlytrained race are always vital that is to say they are orderly manifestations of intense life like the habitual action of the fingers of a musician the customs and manners of a vile and rude race on the contrary are conditions of decay they are not properly speaking habits but incrustations not restraints or forms of life but gangrenesnoisome and the beginnings of death and generally so far as custom attaches itself to indolence instead of action and to prejudice instead of perception it takes this deadly character so that thus    custom hangs upon us with a weight   heavy as frost and deep almost as life  this power and depth are however just what give value to custom when it works with life instead of against it  the high ethical training of a nation being threefold of body heart and practice compare the statement in the preface to unto this last involves exquisiteness in all its perceptions of circumstanceall its occupations of thought it implies perfect grace pitifulness and peace it is irreconcilably inconsistent with filthy or mechanical employmentswith the desire of moneyand with mental states of anxiety jealousy and indifference to pain the present insensibility of the upper classes of europe to the aspects of suffering uncleanness and crime binds them not only into one responsibility with the sin but into one dishonour with the foulness which rot at their thresholds the crimes daily recorded in the police courts of london and paris and much more those which are unrecorded are a disgrace to the whole body politic104 they are as in the body natural stains of disease on a face of delicate skin making the delicacy itself frightful similarly the filth and poverty permitted or ignored in the midst of us are as dishonourable to the whole social body as in the body natural it is to wash the face but leave the hands and feet foul christs way is the only true one begin at the feet the face will take care of itself yet since necessarily in the frame of a nation nothing but the head can be of gold and the feet for the work they have to do must be part of iron part of clayfoul or mechanical work is always reduced by a noble race to the minimum in quantity and even then performed and endured not without sense of degradation as a fine temper is wounded by the sight of the lower offices of the body the highest conditions of human society reached hitherto have cast such work to slavessupposing slavery of a politically defined kind to be done away with mechanical and foul employment must in all highlyorganized states take the aspect either of punishment or probation all criminals should at once be set to the most dangerous and painful forms of it especially to work in mines and at furnaces105 so as to relieve the innocent population as far as possible of merely rough not mechanical manual labour especially agricultural a large portion should be done by the upper classesbodily health and sufficient contrast and repose for the mental functions being unattainable without it what necessarily inferior labour remains to be done as especially in manufactures should and always will when the relations of society are reverent and harmonious fall to the lot of those who for the time are fit for nothing better for as whatever the perfectness of the educational system there must remain infinite differences between the natures and capacities of men and these differing natures are generally rangeable under the two qualities of lordly or tending towards rule construction and harmony and servile or tending towards misrule destruction and discord and since the lordly part is only in a state of profitableness while ruling and the servile only in a state of redeemableness while serving the whole health of the state depends on the manifest separation of these two elements of its mind for if the servile part be not separated and rendered visible in service it mixes with and corrupts the entire body of the state and if the lordly part be not distinguished and set to rule it is crushed and lost being turned to no account so that the rarest qualities of the nation are all given to it in vain106 the effecting of which distinction is the first object as we shall see presently of national councils    104 the ordinary brute who flourishes in the very centre         of ornate life tells us of unknown depths on the verge of         which

mechanical labour the         degradation caused by its excess is a far more serious         subject of thought and of future fear i shall examine this         part of our subject at length hereafter there can hardly be         any doubt at present cast on the truth of the above         passages as all the great thinkers are unanimous on the         matter platos words are terrific in their scorn and pity         whenever he touches on the mechanical arts he calls the men         employed in them not even humanbut partially and         diminutively human greek anthrôpiskoi and opposes

        apparently most strange and cruel with which homer dante         and shakespeare always speak of the populace for it is         entirely true that in great states the lower orders are low         by nature as well as by task being precisely that part of         the commonwealth which has been thrust down for its         coarseness or unworthiness by coarseness i mean especially         insensibility and irreverence the profane of horace and         when this ceases to be so and the corruption and the         profanity are in the higher instead of the lower orders         there arises first helpless confusion then if the lower         classes deserve power ensues swift revolution and they get         it but if neither the populace nor their rulers deserve it         there follows mere darkness and dissolution till out of         the putrid elements some new capacity of order rises like         grass on a grave if not there is no more hope nor shadow         of turning for that nation atropos has her way with it          so that the law of national health is like that of a great         lake or sea in perfect but slow circulation letting the         dregs fall continually to the lowest place and the clear         water rise yet so as that there shall be no neglect of the         lower orders but perfect supervision and sympathy so that         if one member

of what the nation desires should become custom  law is either archic107 of direction meristic of division or critic of judgment archic law is that of appointment and precept it defines what is and is not to be done meristic law is that of balance and distribution it defines what is and is not to be possessed critic law is that of discernment and award it defines what is and is not to be suffered    107 thetic or thesmic would perhaps be a better term than         archic but liable to be confused with some which we shall         want relating to theoria the administrators of the three         great divisions of law are severally archons merists and         dicasts the archons are the true princes or beginners of         things or leaders as of an orchestra the merists are         properly the domini or lords lawwords of houses and         nations the dicasts properly the judges and that with         olympian justice which reaches to heaven and hell the         violation of archic law is greek hamartia error         greek ponêria failure greek plêmmeleia discord         the violation of meristic law is greek anomia iniquity         the violation of critic law is greek adikia injury         iniquity is central generic term for all law is fatal it         is the division to men of their fate as the fold of their         pasture it is greek nomos as the assigning of their         portion greek moira  if we choose to class the laws of precept and distribution under the general head of statutes all law is simply either of statute or judgment that is first the establishment of ordinance and secondly the assignment of the reward or penalty due to its observance or violation  to some extent these two forms of law must be associated and with every ordinance the penalty of disobedience to it be also determined but since the degrees and guilt of disobedience vary the determination of due reward and punishment must be modified by discernment of special fact which is peculiarly the office of the judge as distinguished from that of the lawgiver and lawsustainer or king not but that the two offices are always theoretically and in early stages or limited numbers of society are often practically united in the same person or persons  also it is necessary to keep clearly in view the distinction between these two kinds of law because the possible range of law is wider in proportion to their separation there are many points of conduct respecting which the nation may wisely express its will by a written precept or resolve yet not enforce it by penalty and the expedient degree of penalty is always quite a separate consideration from the expedience of the statute for the statute may often be better enforced by mercy than severity and is also easier in bearing and less likely to be abrogated farther laws of precept have reference especially to youth and concern themselves with training but laws of judgment to manhood and concern themselves with remedy and reward there is a highly curious feeling in the english mind against educational law we think no mans liberty should be interfered with till he has done irrevocable wrong whereas it is then just too late for the only gracious and kingly interference which is to hinder him from doing it make your educational laws strict and your criminal ones may be gentle but leave youth its liberty and you will have to dig dungeons for age and it is good for a man that he wear the yoke in his youth for the yoke of youth if you know how to hold it may be of silken thread and there is sweet chime of silver bells at that bridle rein but for the captivity of age you must forge the iron fetter and cast the passing bell  since no law can be in a final or true sense established but by right all unjust laws involving the ultimate necessity of their own abrogation the lawsustaining power in so far as it is royal or right doingin so far that is as it rules not misrules and orders not disorders the things submitted to it throned on this rock of justice the kingly power becomes established and establishing greek theios or divine and therefore it is literally true that no ruler can err so long as he is a ruler or greek archôn oudeis hamartanei tote hotan archôn ê perverted by careless thought which has cost the world somewhat into the king can do no wrong which is a divine right of kings indeed and quite unassailable so long as the terms of it are god and my right and not satan and my wrong which is apt in some coinages to appear on the reverse of the die under a good lens  meristic law or that of tenure of property first determines what every individual possesses by right and secures it to him and what he possesses by wrong and deprives him of it but it has a far higher provisory function it determines what every man should possess and puts it within his reach on due conditions and what he should not possess and puts this out of his reach conclusively  every article of human wealth has certain conditions attached to its merited possession which when they are unobserved possession becomes rapine the object of meristic law is not only to secure every man his rightful share the share that is which he has worked for produced or received by gift from a rightful owner but to enforce the due conditions of possession as far as law may conveniently reach for instance that land shall not be wantonly allowed to run to waste that streams shall not be poisoned by the persons through whose properties they pass nor air be rendered unwholesome beyond given limits laws of this kind exist already in rudimentary degree but needing large development the just laws respecting the possession of works of art have not hitherto been so much as conceived and the daily loss of national wealth and of its use in this respect is quite incalculable108 while finally in certain conditions of a nations progress laws limiting accumulation of property may be found expedient    108 these laws need revision quite as much respecting property         in national as in private hands for instance the public         are under a vague impression that because they have paid         for the contents of the british museum every one has an         equal right to see and to handle them but the public have         similarly paid for the contents of woolwich arsenal yet do         not expect free access to it or handling of its contents         the british museum is neither a free circulating library         nor a free school it is a place for the safe preservation         and exhibition on due occasion of unique books unique         objects of natural history and unique works of art its         books can no more be used by everybody than its coins can be         handled or its statues cast free libraries there ought to         be in every quarter of london with large and complete         readingrooms attached so also free educational         institutions should be open in every quarter of london all         day long and till late at night well lighted well         catalogued and rich in contents both of art and natural         history but neither the british museum nor national gallery         are schools they are treasuries and both should be         severely restricted in access and in use unless some order         is taken and that soon in the mss department of the         museum sir frederic madden was complaining of this to me         only the other day the best mss in the collection will be         destroyed irretrievably by the careless and continual         handling to which they are now subjected  critic law determines questions of injury and assigns due rewards and punishments to conduct109    109 two curious economical questions arise laterally with         respect to this branch of law namely the cost of crime and         the cost of judgment the cost of crime is endured by         nations ignorantly not being clearly stated in their         budgets the cost of judgment patiently provided only it         can be had pure for the money because the science or         perhaps we ought rather to say the art of law is felt to         found a noble profession and discipline so that civilized         nations are usually glad that a number of persons should be         supported by funds devoted to disputation and analysis but         it has not yet been calculated what the practical value         might have been in other directions of the intelligence         now occupied in deciding through courses of years what         might have been decided as justly had the date of judgment         been fixed in as many hours imagine one half of the funds         which any great nation devotes to dispute by law applied to         the determination of physical questions in medicine         agriculture and theoretic science and calculate the         probable results within the next ten years          i say nothing yet of the more deadly more lamentable loss         involved in the use of purchased instead of personal         justicegreek epaktô par allônaporia oikeiôn  therefore in order to true analysis of it we must understand the real meaning of this word injury  we commonly understand by it any kind of harm done by one man to another but we do not define the idea of harm sometimes we limit it to the harm which the sufferer is conscious of whereas much the worst injuries are those he is unconscious of and at other times we limit the idea to violence or restraint whereas much the worse forms of injury are to be accomplished by carelessness and the withdrawal of restraint  injury is then simply the refusal or violation of any mans right or claim upon his fellows which claim much talked of in modern times under the term right is mainly resolvable into two branches a mans claim not to be hindered from doing what he should and his claim to be hindered from doing what he should not these two forms of hindrance being intensified by reward or help and fortune or fors on one side and punishment impediment and even final arrest or mors on the other  now in order to a mans obtaining these two rights it is clearly needful that the worth of him should be approximately known as well as the want of worth which has unhappily been usually the principal subject of study for critic law careful hitherto only to mark degrees of demerit instead of meritassigning indeed to the deficiencies not always alas even to these just fine diminution or with the broad vowels damnation but to the efficiencies on the other side which are by much the more interesting as well as the only profitable part of its subject assigning in any clear way neither measurement nor aid  now it is in this higher and perfect function of critic law enabling as well as disabling that it becomes truly kingly or basilican instead of draconic what providence gave the great old wrathful legislator his name that is it becomes the law of man and of life instead of the law of the worm and of deathboth of these laws being set in everlasting poise one against another and the enforcement of both being the eternal function of the lawgiver and true claim of every living soul such claim being indeed as straight and earnest to be mercifully hindered and even if need be abolished when longer existence means only deeper destruction as to be mercifully helped and recreated when longer existence and new creation mean nobler life so that what we vulgarly term reward and punishment will be found to resolve themselves mainly into help and hindrance and these again will issue naturally from true recognition of deserving and the just reverence and just wrath which follow instinctively on such recognition  i say follow but in reality they are the recognition reverence is but the perceiving of the thing in its entire truth truth reverted is truth revered vereor and veritas having clearly the same root so that goethe is for once and for a wonder wrong in that part of the noble scheme of education in wilhelm meister in which he says that reverence is not innate and must be taught reverence is as instinctive as angerboth of them instant on true vision it is sight and understanding that we have to teach and these are reverence make a man perceive worth and in its reflection he sees his own relative unworth and worships thereupon inevitably not with stiff courtesy but rejoicingly passionately and best of all restfully for the inner capacity of awe and love is infinite in man and when his eyes are once opened to the sight of beauty and honour it is with him as with a lover who falling at his mistresss feet would cast himself through the earth if it might be to fall lower and find a deeper and humbler place and the common insolences and petulances of the people and their talk of equality are not irreverence in them in the least but mere blindness stupefaction and fog in the brains110 which pass away in the degree that they are raised and purified the first sign of which raising is that they gain some power of discerning and some patience in submitting to their true counsellors and governors the modes of such discernment forming the real constitution of the state and not the titles or offices of the discerned person for it is no matter save in degree of mischief to what office a man is appointed if he cannot fulfil it and this brings us to the third division of our subject    110 compare chaucers villany clownishness            full foul and chorlishe seemed she           and eke villanous for to be           and little coulde of norture           to worship any creature   iiigovernment by council  this is the determination by living authority of the national conduct to be observed under existing circumstances and the modification or enlargement abrogation or enforcement of the code of national law according to present needs or purposes this government is necessarily always by council for though the authority of it may be vested in one person that person cannot form any opinion on a matter of public interest but by voluntarily or involuntarily submitting himself to the influence of others  this government is always twofoldvisible and invisible  the visible government is that which nominally carries on the national business determines its foreign relations raises taxes levies soldiers fights battles or directs that they be fought and otherwise becomes the exponent of the national fortune the invisible government is that exercised by all energetic and intelligent men each in his sphere regulating the inner will and secret ways of the people essentially forming its character and preparing its fate visible governments are the toys of some nations the diseases of others the harness of some the burdens of the more the necessity of all sometimes their career is quite distinct from that of the people and to write it as the national history is as if one should number the accidents which befall a mans weapons and wardrobe and call the list his biography nevertheless a truly noble and wise nation necessarily has a noble and wise visible government for its wisdom issues in that conclusively not out of the oak nor out of the rock but out of the temper of man is his polity where the temper inclines it inclines as samson by his pillar and draws all down with it  visible governments are in their agencies capable of three pure forms and of no more than three  they are either monarchies where the authority is vested in one person oligarchies when it is vested in a minority or democracies when vested in a majority  but these three forms are not only in practice variously limited and combined but capable of infinite difference in character and use receiving specific names according to their variations which names being nowise agreed upon nor consistently used either in thought or writing no man can at present tell in speaking of any kind of government whether he is understood nor in hearing whether he understands thus we usually call a just government by one person a monarchy and an unjust or cruel one a tyranny this might be reasonable if it had reference to the divinity of true government but to limit the term oligarchy to government by a few rich people and to call government by a few wise or noble people aristocracies is evidently absurd unless it were proved that rich people never could be wise or noble people rich and farther absurd because there are other distinctions in character as well as riches or wisdom greater purity of race or strength of purpose for instance which may give the power of government to the few so that if we had to give names to every group or kind of minority we should have verbiage enough but there is one right nameoligarchy  so also the terms republic and democracy are confused especially in modern use and both of them are liable to every sort of misconception a republic means properly a polity in which the state with its all is at every mans service and every man with his all at the states service people are apt to lose sight of the last condition but its government may nevertheless be oligarchic consular or decemviral for instance or monarchic dictatorial but a democracy means a state in which the government rests directly with the majority of the citizens and both these conditions have been judged only by such accidents and aspects of them as each of us has had experience of and sometimes both have been confused with anarchy as it is the fashion at present to talk of the failure of republican institutions in america when there has never yet been in america any such thing as an institution neither any such thing as a respublica but only a multitudinous resprivata every man for himself it is not republicanism which fails now in america it is your model science of political economy brought to its perfect practice there you may see competition and the law of demand and supply especially in paper in beautiful and unhindered operation111 lust of wealth and trust in it vulgar faith in magnitude and multitude instead of nobleness besides that faith

perhaps the wiser         mariner may wish for keel and wheel again  understand then once for all that no form of government provided it be a government at all is as such either to be condemned or praised or contested for in anywise but by fools but all forms of government are good just so far as they attain this one vital necessity of policythat the wise and kind few or many shall govern the unwise and unkind and they are evil so far as they miss of this or reverse it nor does the form in any case signify one whit but its firmness and adaptation to the need for if there be many foolish persons in a state and few wise then it is good that the few govern and if there be many wise and few foolish then it is good that many govern and if many be wise yet one wiser then it is good that one should govern and so on thus we may have the ants republic and the realm of bees both good in their kind one for groping and the other for building and nobler still for flying the ducal monarchy of those    intelligent of seasons that set forth   the aery caravan high over seas  nor need we want examples among the inferior creatures of dissoluteness as well as resoluteness in government i

description of pelicans and climbing perch which i find quoted in one of our popular natural histories out of sir emerson tennents ceylon comes as near as may be to the true image of the thing       heavy rains came on and as we stood on the high ground we      observed a pelican on the margin of the shallow pool gorging      himself our people went towards him and raised a cry of      fish fish we hurried down and found numbers of fish      struggling upward through the grass in the rills formed by      the trickling of the rain there was scarcely water to cover      them but nevertheless they made rapid progress up the bank      on which our followers collected about two baskets of them      they were forcing their way up the knoll and had they not      been interrupted first by the pelican and afterwards by      ourselves they would in a few minutes have gained the      highest point and descended on the other side into a pool      which formed another portion of the tank in going this      distance however they must have used muscular exertion      enough to have taken them half a mile on level ground for      at these places all the cattle and wild animals of the      neighbourhood had latterly come to drink so that the      surface was everywhere indented with footmarks in addition      to the cracks in the surrounding baked mud into which the      fish tumbled in their progress in those holes which were      deep and the sides perpendicular they remained to die and      were carried off by kites and crows  but whether governments be bad or good one general disadvantage seems to attach to them in modern timesthat they are all costly this however is not essentially the fault of the governments if nations choose to play at war they will always find their governments willing to lead the game and soon coming under that term of aristophanes greek kapêloi aspidôn shieldsellers and when greek pêm epipêmati the shields take the form of iron ships with

right to complain of our governments being expensive so long as we set the government to do precisely the work which brings no return if our present doctrines of political economy be just let us trust them to the utmost take that war business out of the governments hands and test therein the principles of supply and demand let our future sieges of sebastopol be done by contractno capture no payi am prepared to admit that things might go better so and let us sell the commands of our prospective battles with our vicarages to the lowest bidder so may we have cheap victories and divinity on the other hand if we have so much suspicion of our science that we dare not trust it on military or spiritual business it would be but reasonable to try whether some authoritative handling may not prosper in matters utilitarian if we were to set our governments to do useful things instead of mischievous possibly even the apparatus might in time come to be less costly the machine applied to the building of the house might perhaps pay when it seems not to pay applied to pulling it down if we made in our dockyards ships to carry timber and coals instead of cannon and with provision for brightening of domestic solid culinary fire instead of for the averting of hostile liquid fire it might have some effect on the taxes or if the iron bottoms were to bring us home nothing better than ivory and peacocks instead of martial glory we might at least have gayer suppers and doors of the right material for dreams after them or suppose that we tried the experiment on land instead of water carriage already the government not unapproved carries letters and parcels for us larger packages may in time followparcelseven general merchandise why not at last ourselves had the money spent in local mistakes and vain private litigation on the railroads of england been laid out instead under proper government restraint on really useful railroad work and had no absurd expense been incurred in

swift safety and watched and warded by wellpaid pointsmen for half the present fares greek hô dêmidion horas ta lagô ha soi pherô suppose it should turn out finally that a true government set to true work instead of being a costly engine was a paying one that your government rightly organized instead of itself subsisting by an income tax would produce its subjects some subsistence in the shape of an income dividendpolice and judges duly paid besides only with less work than the state at present provides for them  a true government set to true worknot easily imagined still less obtained but not beyond human hope or ingenuity only you will have to alter your election systems somewhat first not by universal suffrage nor by votes purchasable with beer is such government to be had that is to say not by universal equal suffrage every man upwards of twenty who had been convicted of no legal crime should have his say in this matter but afterwards a louder voice as he grows older and approves himself wiser if he has one vote at twenty he should have two at thirty four at forty and ten at fifty for every one vote which he has with an income of a hundred a year he should have ten with an income of a thousand provided you first see to it that wealth is as nature intended it to be the reward of sagacity and industrynot of good luck in a scramble or a lottery for every one vote which he had as subordinate in any business he should have two when he became a master and every office and authority nationally bestowed inferring trustworthiness and intellect should have its known proportional number of votes attached to it but into the detail and working of a true system in these matters we cannot now enter we are concerned as yet with definitions only and statements of first principles which will be established now sufficiently for our purposes when we have examined the nature of that form of government last on the list in the previous paperthe purely magistral exciting at present its full share of public notice under its ambiguous title of slavery  i have not however been able to ascertain in definite terms from the declaimers against slavery what they understand by it if they mean only the imprisonment or compulsion being in many cases highly expedient slavery so defined would be no evil in itself but only in its abuse that is when men are slaves who should not be or masters who should not be or under conditions which should not be it is not for instance a necessary condition of slavery nor a desirable one that parents should be separated from children or husbands from wives but the institution of war against which people declaim with less violence effects such separationsnot unfrequently in a higher permanent manner to press a sailor seize a white youth by conscription for a soldier or carry off a black one for a labourer may all be right or all wrong according to needs and circumstances it is wrong to scourge a man unnecessarily so it is to shoot him both must be done on occasion and it is better and kinder to flog a man to his work than to leave him idle till he robs and flog him afterwards the essential thing for all creatures is to be made to do right how they are made to do itby pleasant promises or hard necessities pathetic oratory or the whip is comparatively immaterial to be deceived is perhaps as incompatible with human dignity as to be whipped and i suspect the last instrument to be not the worst for the help of many individuals the jewish nation throve under it in the hand of a monarch reputed not unwise it is only the change of whip for scorpion which is expedient and yet that change is as likely to come to pass on the side of licence as of law for the true scorpion whips are those of the nations pleasant vices which are to it as st johns locustscrown on the head ravin in the mouth and sting in the tail if it will not bear the rule of athena and her brother who shepherd without smiting greek ou plêgê nemontes athena at last calls no more in the corners of the streets and then follows the rule of tisiphone who smites without shepherding  if however slavery instead of absolute compulsion is meant the purchase by money of the right of compulsion such purchase is necessarily made whenever a portion of any territory is transferred for money from one monarch to another which has happened frequently enough in history without its being supposed that the inhabitants of the districts so transferred became their slaves in this as in the former case the dispute seems about the fashion of the thing rather than the fact of it there are two rocks in midsea on each of which neglected equally by instructive and commercial powers a handful of inhabitants live as they may two merchants bid for the two properties but not in the same terms one bids for the people buys them and sets them to work under pain of scourge the other bids for the rock buys it and throws the inhabitants into the sea the former is the american the latter the english method of slavery much is to be said for and something against both which i hope to say in due time and place  if however slavery mean not merely the purchase of the right of compulsion but the purchase of the body and soul of the creature itself for money it is not i think among the black races that purchases of this kind are most extensively made or that separate souls of a fine make fetch the highest price this branch of the inquiry we shall have occasion also to follow out at some length for in the worst instance of the greek biôn prasis we are apt to get only pyrrhons answergreek ti phêsepriamên se adêlon  the fact is that slavery is not a political institution at all but an inherent natural and eternal inheritance of a large portion of the human raceto whom the more you give of their own will the more slaves they will make themselves in common parlance we idly confuse captivity with slavery and are always thinking of the

in these prefatory papers at somewhat more length on this matter had not all i would say been said already in vain by carlyle in the first of the latterday pamphlets which i commend to the readers gravest reading together with that as much neglected and still more immediately needed on model prisons and with the great chapter on permanence fifth of the last section of past and present which sums what is known and foreshadowsor rather forelights all that is to be learned of national discipline i have only here farther to examine the nature of one worldwide and everlasting form of slavery wholesome in use deadly in abusethe service of the rich by the poor  as in all previous discussions of our subject we must study this relation in its simplest elements in order to reach its first principles the simplest state of it is then this115 a wise and provident person works much consumes little and lays by store an improvident person works little consumes all the produce and lays by no store accident interrupts the daily work or renders it less productive the idle person must then starve or be supported by the provident onewho having him thus at his mercy may either refuse to maintain him altogether or which will evidently be more to his own interest say to him i will maintain you indeed but you shall now work hard instead of indolently and instead of being allowed to lay by what you save as you might have done had you remained independent i will take all the surplus you would not lay it up yourself it is wholly your own fault that has thrown you into my power and i will force you to work or starve yet you shall have no profit only your daily bread this mode of treatment has now become so universal that it is supposed the only naturalnay the only possible one and the market wages are calmly defined by economists as the sum which will maintain the labourer    115 in the present general examination i concede so much to         ordinary economists as to ignore all innocent poverty i         assume poverty to be always criminal the conceivable         exceptions we will examine afterwards  the power of the provident person to do this is only checked by the correlative power of some neighbour of similarly frugal habits who says to the laboureri will give you a little more than my provident friendcome and work for me the power of the provident over the improvident depends thus primarily on their relative numbers secondarily on the modes of agreement of the adverse parties with each other the level of wages is a variable function of the number of provident and idle persons in the world of the enmity between them as classes and of the agreement between those of the same class it depends from beginning to end on moral conditions  supposing the rich to be entirely selfish it is always for their interest that the poor should be as numerous as they can employ and restrain for granting the entire population no larger than the ground can easily maintainthat the classes are stringently dividedand that there is sense or strength of hand enough with the rich to secure obedience then if ninetenths of a nation are poor the remaining tenth have the service of nine persons each116 but if eighttenths are poor only of four each if seventenths are poor of two and a third each but practically if the rich strive always to obtain more power over the poor instead of to raise themand if on the other hand the poor become continually more vicious and numerous through neglect and oppressionthough the range of the power of the rich increases its tenure becomes less secure until at last the measure of iniquity being full revolution civil war or the subjection of the state to a healthier or stronger one closes the moral corruption and industrial disease    116 i say nothing yet of the quality of the servants which         nevertheless is the gist of the business will you have         paul veronese to paint your ceiling or the plumber from         over the way both will work for the same money paul if         anything a little cheaper of the two if you keep him in         good humour only you have to discern him first which will         need eyes  it is rare however that things come to this extremity kind persons among the rich and wise among the poor modify the connexion of the classes the efforts made to raise and relieve on the one side and the success and honest toil on the other bind and blend the orders of society into the confused tissue of halffelt obligation sullenlyrendered obedience and variouslydirected or misdirected toil which form the warp of daily life but this great law rules all the wild design of the weaving that success while society is guided by laws of competition signifies always so much victory over your neighbour as to obtain the direction of his work and to take the profits of it this is the real source of all great riches no man can become largely rich by his personal toil117 the work of his own hands wisely directed will indeed always maintain himself and his family and make fitting provision for his age but it is only by the discovery of some method of taxing the labour of others that he can become opulent every increase of his capital enables him to extend this taxation more widely that is to invest larger funds in the maintenance of his labourersto direct accordingly vaster and yet vaster masses of labour and to appropriate its profits there is much confusion of idea on the subject of this appropriation it is of course the interest of the employer to disguise it from the persons employed and for his own comfort and complacency he often desires no less to disguise it from himself and it is matter of much doubt with me how far the foolish arguments used habitually on this subject are indeed the honest expressions of foolish convictionsor rather as i am sometimes forced to conclude from the irritation with which they are advanced are resolutely dishonest wilful sophisms arranged so as to mask to the last moment the real state of economy and future duties of men by taking a simple example and working it thoroughly out the subject may be rescued from all but determined misconception    117 by his heart he may but only when its produce or the         sight or hearing of it becomes a subject of dispute so as         to enable the artist to tax the labour of multitudes highly         in exchange for his own  let us imagine a society of peasants living on a rivershore exposed to destructive inundation at somewhat extended intervals and that each peasant possesses of this good but imperilled ground more than he needs to cultivate for immediate subsistence we will assume farther and with too great probability of justice that the greater part of them indolently keep in tillage just as much land as supplies them with daily foodthat they leave their children idle and untaught and take no precautions against the rise of the stream but one of them we will say only one for the sake of greater clearness cultivates carefully all the ground of his estate makes his children work hard and healthily uses his spare time and theirs in building a rampart against the river and at the end of some years has in his storehouses large reserves of food and clothing and in his stables a welltended breed of cattle  the torrent rises at lastsweeps away the harvests and many of the cottages of the careless peasantry and leaves them destitute they naturally come for help to the provident one whose fields are unwasted and whose granaries are full he has the right to refuse it them no one disputes his right but he will probably not refuse it it is not his interest to do so even were he entirely selfish and cruel the only question with him will be on what terms his aid is to be granted  clearly not on terms of mere charity to maintain his neighbours in idleness would be his ruin and theirs he will require work from them in exchange for their maintenance and whether in kindness or cruelty all the work they can give not now the three or four hours they were wont to spend on their own land but the eight or ten hours they ought to have spent but how will he apply this labour the men are now his slavesnothing less on pain of starvation he can force them to work in the manner and to the end he chooses and it is by his wisdom in this choice that the worthiness of his mastership is proved or its unworthiness evidently he must first set them to bank out the water in some temporary way and to get their ground cleansed and resown else in any case their continued maintenance will be impossible that done and while he has still to feed them suppose he makes them raise a secure rampart for their own ground against all future flood and rebuild their houses in safer places with the best material they can find being allowed time out of their working hours to fetch such material from a distance and for the food and clothing advanced he takes security in land that as much shall be returned at a convenient period  at the end of a few years we may conceive this security redeemed and the debt paid the prudent peasant has sustained no loss but is no richer than he was and has had all his trouble for nothing but he has enriched his neighbours materially bettered their houses secured their land and rendered them in worldly matters equal to himself in all true and final sense he has been throughout their lord and king  we will next trace his probable line of conduct presuming his object to be exclusively the increase of his own fortune after roughly recovering and cleansing the ground he allows the ruined peasantry only to build huts upon it such as he thinks protective enough from the weather to keep them in working health the rest of their time he occupies first in pulling down and rebuilding on a magnificent scale his own house and in adding large dependencies to it this done he follows the example of the first great hebrew financier and in exchange for his continued supply of corn buys as much of his neighbours land as he thinks he can superintend the management of and makes the former owners securely embank and protect the ceded portion by this arrangement he leaves to a certain number of the peasantry only as much ground as will just maintain them in their existing numbers as the population increases he takes the extra hands who cannot be maintained on the narrow estates for his own servants employs some to cultivate the ground he has bought giving them of its produce merely enough for subsistence with the surplus which under his energetic and careful superintendence will be large he supports a train of servants for state and a body of workmen whom he educates in ornamental arts he now can splendidly decorate his house lay out its grounds magnificently and richly supply his table and that of his household and retinue and thus without any abuse of right we should find established all the phenomena of poverty and riches which it is supposed necessarily accompany modern civilization in one part of the district we should have unhealthy land miserable dwellings and halfstarved poor in another a wellordered estate wellfed servants and refined conditions of highlyeducated and luxurious life  i have put the two cases in simplicity and to some extremity but though in more complex and qualified operation all the relations of society are but the expansion of these two typical sequences of conduct and result i do not say observe that the first procedure is entirely right still less that the second is wholly wrong servants and artists and splendour of habitation and retinue have all their use propriety and office i only wish the reader to understand clearly what they cost that the condition of having them is the subjection to you of a certain number of imprudent or unfortunate persons or it may be more fortunate than their master over whose destinies you exercise a boundless control riches mean eternally and essentially this and may heaven send at last a time when those words of our bestreputed economist shall be true and we shall indeed all know what it is to be rich that is to be slavemaster over farthest earth and over all ways and thoughts of men every operative you employ is your true servant distant or near subject to your immediate orders or ministering to your widelycommunicated capricefor the pay he stipulates or the price he temptsall are alike under this great dominion of the gold the milliner who makes the dress is as much a servant more so in that she uses more intelligence in the service as the maid who puts it on the carpenter who smoothes the door as the footman who opens it the tradesmen who supply the table as the labourers and sailors who supply the tradesmen why speak of these lower services painters and singers whether of note or rhyme jesters and storytellers moralists historians priestsso far as these in any degree paint or sing or tell their tale or charm their charm or perform their rite for pay in so far they are all slaves abject utterly if the service be for pay only abject less and less in proportion to the degrees of love and wisdom which enter into their duty or can enter into it according as their function is to do the bidding and the work of a manor to amuse tempt and deceive a child  there may be thus and to a certain extent there always is a government of the rich by the poor as of the poor by the rich but the latter is the prevailing and necessary one and it consists observe of two distinct functionsthe collection of the profits of labour from those who would have misused them and the administration of those profits for the service either of the same person in future or of others or as is more frequently the case in modern times for the service of the collector himself  the examination of these various modes of collection and use of riches will form the third branch of our future inquiries but the key to the whole subject lies in the clear understanding of the difference between selfish and unselfish expenditure it is not easy by any course of reasoning to enforce this on the generally unwilling hearer yet the definition of unselfish expenditure is brief and simple it is expenditure which if you are a capitalist does not pay you but pays somebody else and if you are a consumer does not please you but pleases somebody else take one special instance in further illustration of the general type given above i did not invent that type but spoke of a real river and of real peasantry the languid and sickly race which inhabits or hauntsfor they are often more like spectres than living menthe thorny desolation on the banks of the arve some years ago a society formed at geneva offered to embank the river for the ground which would have been recovered by the operation but the offer was refused by the then sardinian government the capitalists saw that this expenditure would have paid if the ground saved from the river was to be theirs but if when the offer that had this aspect of profit was refused they had nevertheless persisted in the plan and merely taking security for the return of their outlay lent the funds for the work and thus saved a whole race of human souls from perishing in a pestiferous fen as i presume some among them would at personal risk have dragged any one drowning creature out of the current of the stream and not expected payment therefor such expenditure would have precisely corresponded to the use of his power made in the first instance by our supposed richest peasantit would have been the kings of grace instead of the usurers for gain  impossible absurd utopian exclaim ninetenths of the few readers whom these words may find no good reader this is not utopian but i will tell you what would have seemed if we had not seen it utopian on the side of evil instead of good that ever men should have come to value their money so much more than their lives that if you call upon them to become soldiers and take chance of bullet for their prides sake they will do it gaily without thinking twice but if you ask them for their countrys sake to spend a hundred pounds without security of getting back a hundredandfive118 they will laugh in your face    118 i have not hitherto touched on the subject of interest of         money it is too complex and must be reserved for its         proper place in the body of the work i should be glad if a         writer who sent me some valuable notes on this subject and         asked me to return a letter which i still keep at his         service would send me his address the definition of         interest apart from compensation for risk is the         exponent of the comfort of accomplished labour separated         from its power the power being what is lent and the         french economists who have maintained the entire illegality         of interest are wrong yet by no means so curiously or         wildly wrong as the english and french ones opposed to them         whose opinions have been collected by dr whewell at page 41         of his lectures it never seeming to occur to the mind of         the compiler any more than to the writers whom he quotes         that it is quite possible and even according to jewish         proverb prudent for men to hoard as ants and mice do for         use not usury and lay by something for winter nights in         the expectation of rather sharing than lending the         scrapings my savoyard squirrels would pass a pleasant time         of it under the snowladen pinebranches if they always         declined to economize because no one would pay them interest         on nuts  not

daylabourers could not end  but we will press the example closer on a green knoll above that plain of the arve between cluses and bonneville there was in the year 1860 a cottage inhabited by a welldoing familyman and wife three children and the grandmother i call it a cottage but in truth it was a large chimney on the ground wide at the bottom so that the family might live round the fire with one broken window in it and an unclosing door the family i say was welldoing at least it was hopeful and cheerful the wife healthy the children for savoyards pretty and active but the husband threatened with decline from exposure under the cliffs of the mont vergi by day and to draughts between every plank of his chimney in the frosty nights why could he not plaster the chinks asks the practical reader for the same reason that your child cannot wash its face and hands till you have washed them many a day for it and will not wash them when it can till you force it    119 compare

protected by the peculiar         appropriation of part of the church rates in our country         parishes see the remonstrance from a country parson in         the times of june 4th or 5th the letter is dated june         3rd 1862i have heard at a vestry meeting a good deal         of higgling over a few shillings outlay in cleaning the         church but i have never heard any dissatisfaction expressed         on account of the part of the rate which is invested in         fifty or 100 dozens of birds heads  i passed this cottage often in my walks had its window and door mended sometimes mended also a little the meal of sour bread and broth and generally got kind greeting and smile from the face of young or old which greeting this year narrowed itself into the halfrecognizing stare of the elder child and the old womans tears for the father and mother were both deadone of sickness the other of sorrow it happened that i passed not alone but with a companion a practised english joiner who while these people were dying of cold had been employed from six in the morning to six of the evening for two months in fitting the panels without nails of a single door in a large house in london three days of his work taken at the right time from the oak panels and applied to the larch timbers would have saved these savoyards lives he would have been maintained equally i suppose him equally paid for his work by the owner of the greater house only the work not consumed selfishly on his own walls and the two peasants and eventually probably their children saved  there are therefore let me finally enforce and leave with the reader this broad conclusionthree things to be considered in employing any poor person it is not enough to give him employment you must employ him first to produce useful things secondly of the several suppose equally useful things he can equally well produce you must set him to make that which will cause him to lead the healthiest life lastly of the things produced it remains a question of wisdom and conscience how much you are to take yourself and how much to leave to others a large quantity remember unless you destroy it must always be so left at one time or another the only questions you have to decide are not what you will give and what you will keep but when and how and to whom you will give the natural law of human life is of course that in youth a man shall labour and lay by store for his old age and when age comes should use what he has laid by gradually slackening his toil and allowing himself more frank use of his store taking care always to leave himself as much as will surely suffice for him beyond any possible length of life what he has gained or by tranquil and unanxious toil continues to gain more than is enough for his own need he ought so to administer while he yet lives as to see the good of it again beginning in other hands for thus he has himself the greatest sum of pleasure from it and faithfully uses his sagacity in its control whereas most men it appears dislike the sight of their fortunes going out into service again and say to themselvesi can indeed nowise prevent this money from falling at last into the hands of others nor hinder the good of it such as it is from becoming theirs not mine but at least let a merciful death save me from being a witness of their satisfaction and may god so far be gracious to me as to let no good come of any of this money of mine before my eyes supposing this feeling unconquerable the safest way of rationally indulging it would be for the capitalist at once to spend all his fortune on himself which might actually in many cases be quite the rightest as well as the pleasantest thing to do if he had just tastes and worthy passions but whether for himself only or through the hands and for the sake of others also the law of wise life is that the maker of the money should also be the spender of it and spend it approximately all before he dies so that his true ambition as an economist should be to die not as rich but as poor as possible calculating the ebb tide of possession in true and calm proportion to the ebb tide of life which law checking the wing of accumulative desire in the midvolley120 and leading to peace of possession and fulness of fruition in old age is also wholesome in that by the freedom of gift together with present help and counsel it at once endears and dignifies age in the sight of youth which then no longer strips the bodies of the dead but receives the grace of the living its chief use would or will be for men are indeed capable of attaining to this much use for their reason that some temperance and measure will be put to the acquisitiveness of commerce121 for as things stand a man holds it his duty to be temperate in his food and of his body but for no duty to be temperate in his riches and of his mind he sees that he ought not to waste his youth and his flesh for luxury but he will waste his age and his soul for money and think it no wrong nor the delirium tremens of the intellect any evil but the law of life is that a man should fix the sum he desires to make annually as the food he desires to eat daily and stay when he has reached the limit refusing increase of business and leaving it to others so obtaining due freedom of time for better thoughts how the gluttony of business is punished a bill of health for the principals of the richest city houses issued annually would show in a sufficiently impressive manner    120 greek kai penian

of         transaction and accident of discovery or contrivance         i have no doubt that the final interest of every nation         is to check the action of these commercial lotteries but         speculation absolute unconnected with commercial effort is         an unmitigated evil in a state and the root of countless         evils beside  i know of course that these statements will be received by the modern merchant as an active border rider of the sixteenth century would have heard of its being proper for men of the marches to get their living by the spade instead of the spur but my business is only to state veracities and necessities i neither look for the acceptance of the one nor promise anything for the nearness of the other near or distant the day will assuredly come when the merchants of a state shall be its true ministers of exchange its porters in the double sense of carriers and gatekeepers bringing all lands into frank and faithful communication and knowing for their master of guild hermes the herald instead of mercury the gainguarder  and now finally for immediate rule to whom it concerns  the distress of any population means that they need food houseroom clothes and fuel you can never therefore be wrong in employing any labourer to produce food houseroom clothes or fuel but you are always wrong if you employ him to produce nothing for then some other labourer must be worked double time to feed him and you are generally wrong at present if you employ him unless he can do nothing else to produce works of art or luxuries because modern art is mostly on a false basis and modern luxury is criminally great122    122 it is especially necessary that the reader should keep his         mind fixed on the methods of consumption and destruction as         the true sources of national poverty men are apt to watch         rather the exchanges in a state than its damages but the         exchanges are only of importance so far as they bring about         these last a large number of the purchases made by the         richer classes are mere forms of interchange of unused         property wholly without effect on national prosperity it         matters nothing to the state whether if a china pipkin be         rated as worth a hundred pounds a has the pipkin and b the         pounds or a the pounds and b the pipkin but if the pipkin         is pretty and a or b breaks it there is national loss not         otherwise so again when the loss has really taken place         no shifting of the shoulders that bear it will do away with         the fact of it there is an intensely ludicrous notion in         the public mind respecting the abolishment of debt by         denying it when a debt is denied the lender loses instead         of the borrower that is all the loss is precisely         accurately everlastingly the same the americans borrow         money to spend in blowing up their own houses they deny         their debt by one third already gold being at fifty         premium and will probably deny it wholly that merely means         that the holders of the notes are to be the losers instead         of the issuers the quantity of loss is precisely equal and         irrevocable it is the quantity of human industry spent in         explosion plus the quantity of goods exploded honour only         decides who shall pay the sum lost not whether it is to be         paid or not paid it must be and to the uttermost farthing  the way to produce more food is mainly to bring in fresh ground and increase facilities of carriageto break rock exchange earth drain the moist and water the dry to mend roads and build harbours of refuge taxation thus spent will annihilate taxation but spent in war it annihilates revenue  the way to produce houseroom is to apply your force first to the humbler dwellings when your bricklayers are out of employ do not build splendid new streets but better the old ones send your paviours and slaters to the poorest villages and see that your poor are healthily lodged before you try your hand on stately architecture you will find its stateliness rise better under the trowel afterwards and we do not yet build so well as that we need hasten to display our skill to future ages had the labour which has decorated the houses of parliament filled instead rents in walls and roofs throughout the county of middlesex and our deputies met to talk within massive walls that would have needed no stucco for five hundred yearsthe decoration might have been better afterwards and the talk now and touching even our highly conscientious church building it may be well to remember that in the best days of church plans their masons called themselves logeurs du bon dieu and that since according to the most trusted reports god spends a good deal of his time in cottages as well as in churches he might perhaps like to be a little better lodged there also  the way to get more clothes isnot necessarily to get more cotton there were words written twenty years ago which would have saved many of us some shivering had they been minded in time shall we read them  the continental people it would seem are importing our machinery beginning to spin cotton and manufacture for themselves to cut us out of this market and then out of that sad news indeed but irremediableby no means the saddest news is that we should find our national existence as i sometimes hear it said depend on selling manufactured cotton at a farthing an ell cheaper than any other people a most narrow stand for a great nation to base itself on a stand which with all the cornlaw abrogations conceivable i do not think will be capable of enduring  my friends suppose we quitted that stand suppose we came honestly down from it and said this is our minimum cottonprices we care not for the present to make cotton any cheaper do you if it seem so blessed to you make cotton cheaper fill your lungs with cottonfuzz your hearts with copperasfumes with rage and mutiny become ye the general gnomes of europe slaves of the lamp i admire a nation which fancies it will die if it do not undersell all other nations to the end of the world brothers we will cease to undersell them we will be content to equalsell them to be happy selling equally with them i do not see the use of underselling them cottoncloth is already twopence a yard or lower and yet bare backs were never more numerous among us let inventive men cease to spend their existence incessantly contriving how cotton can be made cheaper and try to invent a little how cotton at its present cheapness could be somewhat justlier divided among us let inventive men consider whether the secret of this universe and of mans life there does after all as we rashly fancy it

    these introductory essays are as yet in imperfect form i      suffer them to appear though they were not intended for      immediate publication for the sake of such chance service      as may be found in them       here the author indicated certain corrections which have      been carried out in this edition he then went on to say      that the note on charis p 274 required a word or two in      further illustration as follows       the derivation of words is like that of rivers there is one      real source usually small unlikely and difficult to find      far up among the hills then as the word flows on and comes      into service it takes in the force of other words from      other sources and becomes itself quite another wordeven      more than one word after the junctiona word as it were of      many waters sometimes both sweet and bitter thus the whole      force of our english charity depends on the guttural in      charis getting confused with the c of the latin carus      thenceforward throughout the middle ages the two ideas      ran on together and both got confused with st pauls      greek agapê which expresses a different idea in all      sorts of ways our charity having not only brought in the      entirely foreign sense of almsgiving but lost the essential      sense of contentment and lost much more in getting too far      away from the charis of the final gospel benedictions      for truly it is fine christianity we have come to which      professing to expect the perpetual grace of its founder      has not itself grace enough to save it from overreaching      its friends in sixpenny bargains and which supplicating      evening and morning the forgiveness of its own debts goes      forth in the daytime to take its fellowservants by the      throat sayingnot pay me that thou owest but pay me      that thou owest me not       not but that we sometimes wear ophelias rue with a      difference and call it herb o grace o sundays taking

was i wis         when that she gave and said have this       again the first root of the word faith being far away      incompare my note on this force of it in modern      painters vol v p 255 the latins as proved by      ciceros derivation of the word got their facio also      involved in the idea and so the word and the world with      it gradually lose themselves in an arachnoid web of      disputation concerning faith and works no one ever taking      the pains to limit the meaning of the term which in      earliest scriptural use is as nearly as possible our english      obedience then the latin fides a quite different word      alternately active and passive in different uses runs into      foi facere through ficare into fier at the end      of words and fidere into fier absolute and out of      this endless reticulation of thought and word rise still      more finely reticulated theories concerning salvation by      faiththe things which the populace expected to be saved      from being indeed carved for them in a very graphic manner      in their cathedral porches but the things they were      expected to believe being carved for them not so clearly       lastly i debated with myself whether to make the note on      homer longer by examining the typical meaning of the      shipwreck of ulysses and his escape from charybdis by help      of her figtree but as i should have had to go on to the      lovely myth of leucotheas veil and did not care to spoil      this by a hurried account of it i left it for future      examination and three days after the paper was published      observed that the reviewers with their usual useful      ingenuity were endeavouring to throw the whole subject back      into confusion by dwelling on the single as they imagined      oversight i omitted also a note on the sense of the word      greek lygron with respect to the pharmacy of circe and      herbfields of helen compare its use in odyssey xvii 473      etc which would further have illustrated the nature of      the circean power but not to be led too far into the      subtleness of these myths respecting them all i have but      this to say even in very simple parables it is not always      easy to attach indisputable meaning to every part of them i      recollect some years ago throwing an assembly of learned      persons who had met to delight themselves with      interpretations of the parable of the prodigal son      interpretations which had up to that moment gone very      smoothly into high indignation by inadvertently asking who      the prodigal son was and what was to be learned by his      example the leading divine of the company still one of our      great popular preachers at last explained to me that the      unprodigal son was a lay figure put in for dramatic effect      to make the story prettier and that no note was to be taken      of him without however admitting that homer put in the      last escape of ulysses merely to make his story prettier      this is nevertheless true of all greek myths that they have      many opposite lights and shades they are as changeful as      opal and like opal usually have one colour by reflected      and another by transmitted light but they are true jewels      for all that and full of noble enchantment for those who      can use them for those who cannot i am content to repeat      the words i wrote four years ago in the appendix to the      two paths       the entire purpose of a great thinker may be difficult to      fathom and we may be over and over again more or less      mistaken in guessing at his meaning but the real profound      nay quite bottomless and unredeemable mistake is the      fools thought that he had no meaning   london ward lock  co limited
