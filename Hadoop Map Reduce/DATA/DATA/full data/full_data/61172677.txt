the fireside l     scene i    to these leslie c  leslie may i come in mary  mary why not  leslie i scarce knew where to find you  mary the dad and i must have a corner must we not so when my brothers friends are in the parlour he allows us to sit in his room tis a great favour i can tell you the place is sacred  leslie are you sure that sacred is strong enough  mary you are satirical  leslie i and with regard to the deacon believe me i am not so illadvised you have trained me well and i feel by him as solemnly as a trueborn brodie  mary and now you are impertinent do you mean to go any further we are a fighting race we brodies o you may laugh sir but tis no childs play to jest us on our deacon or for that matter on our deacons chamber either it was his fathers before him he works in it by day and sleeps in it by night and scarce anything it contains but is the labour of his hands do you see this table walter he made it while he was yet a prentice i remember how i used to sit and watch him at his work it would be grand i thought to be able to do as he did and handle edgetools without cutting my fingers and getting my ears pulled for a meddlesome minx he used to give me his mallet to keep and his nails to hold and didnt i fly when he called for them and wasnt i proud to be ordered about with them and then you know there is the tall cabinet yonder that it was that proved him the first of edinburgh joiners and worthy to be their deacon and their head and the fathers chair and the sisters workbox and the dear dead mothers footstoolwhat are they all but proofs of the deacons skill and tokens of the deacons care for those about him  leslie i am all penitence forgive me this last time and i promise you i never will again  mary candidly now do you think you deserve forgiveness  leslie candidly i do not  mary then i suppose you must have it what have you done with willie and my uncle  leslie i left them talking deeply the dear old procurator has not much thought just now for anything but those mysterious burglaries  mary i know  leslie still all of him that is not magistrate and official is politician and citizen and he has been striving his hardest to undermine the deacons principles and win the deacons vote and interest  mary they are worth having are they not  leslie the procurator seems to think that having them makes the difference between winning and losing  mary did he say so you may rely upon it that he knows there are not many in edinburgh who can match with our will  leslie there shall be as many as you please and not one more  mary how i should like to have heard you what did uncle say did he speak of the town council again did he tell will what a wonderful bailie he would make o why did you come away  leslie i could not pretend to listen any longer the election is months off yet and if it were notif it were tramping upstairs this momentdrums flags cockades guineas candidates and allhow should i care for it what are whig and tory to me  mary o fie on you it is for every man to concern himself in the common weal mr leslieleslie of the craigshould know that much at least  leslie and be a politician like the deacon all in good time but not now i hearkened while i could and when i could no more i slipped out and followed my heart i hoped i should be welcome  mary i suppose you mean to be unkind  leslie tit for tat did you not ask me why i came away and is it usual for a young lady to say mr to the man she means to marry  mary that is for the young lady to decide sir  leslie and against that judgment there shall be no appeal  mary o if you mean to argue  leslie i do not mean to argue i am content to love and be loved i think i am the happiest man in the world  mary that is as it should be for i am the happiest girl  leslie why not say the happiest wife i have your word and you have mine is not that enough  mary have you so soon forgotten did i not tell you how it must be as my brother wills i can do only as he bids me  leslie then you have not spoken as you promised  mary i have been too happy to speak  leslie i am his friend precious as you are he will trust you to me he has but to know how i love you mary and how your life is all in your love of me to give us his blessing with a full heart  mary i am sure of him it is that which makes my happiness complete even to our marriage i should find it hard to say yes when he said no  leslie your father is trying to speak ill wager he echoes you  mary to old brodie my poor dearie do you want to say anything to me no is it to mr leslie then  leslie i am listening mr brodie  mary what is it daddie  old brodie my sonthe deacondeacon brodiethe first at school  leslie i know it mr brodie was i not the last in the same class to mary but he seems to have forgotten us  mary o yes his mind is wellnigh gone he will sit for hours as you see him and never speak nor stir but at the touch of wills hand or the sound of wills name  leslie it is so good to sit beside you by and by it will always be like this you will not let me speak to the deacon you are fast set upon speaking yourself i could be so eloquent maryi would touch him i cannot tell you how i fear to trust my happiness to any one elseeven to you  mary he must hear of my good fortune from none but me and besides you do not understand we are not like other families we brodies we are so clannish we hold so close together  leslie you brodies and your deacon  old brodie deacon of his craft sirdeacon of the wrightsmy son if his motherhis motherhad but lived to see  mary you hear how he runs on a word about my brother and he catches it tis as if he were awake in his poor blind way to all the deacons care for him and all the deacons kindness to me i believe he only lives in the thought of the deacon there it is not so long since i was one with him but indeed i think we are all deaconmad we brodiesare we not daddie dear  brodie without and entering you are a mighty magistrate procurator but you seem to have met your match     scene ii    to these brodie and lawson  mary curtseying so uncle you have honoured us at last  lawson quam primum my dear quam primum  brodie well father do you know me he sits beside his father and takes his hand  old brodie williamaydeacon greater manthanhis father  brodie you see procurator the news is as fresh to him as it was five years ago he was struck down before he got the deaconship and lives his lost life in mine  lawson ay i mind he was aye ettling after a bit handle to his name he was kind of hurt when first they made me procurator  mary and what have you been talking of  lawson just o thae robberies mary baith as a burgher and a crown offeecial i tak the maist absorbing interest in thae robberies  leslie egad procurator and so do i  brodie with a quick look at leslie a dilettante interest doubtless see what it is to be idle  leslie faith brodie i hardly know how to style it  brodie at any rate tis not the interest of a victim or we should certainly have known of it before nor a practical toolmongering interest like my own nor an interest professional and official like the procurators you can answer for that i suppose  leslie i think i can if for no more its an interest of my own you see and is best described as indescribable and of no manner of moment to anybody it will take no hurt if we put off its discussion till a month of sundays  brodie you are more fortunate than you deserve what do you say procurator  lawson ay is he theres no a house in edinburgh safe the law is clean helpless clean helpless a week syne it was auld andra simpsons in the lawnmarket then naething would set the catamarans but to forgather privily wi the provosts ain butler and tak unto themselves the provosts ain plate and the day information was laid down before me offeecially that the limmers had made infraction vi et clam into leddy marget dalziels and left her leddyship wi no sae muckles a spune to sup her parritch wi its unbelievable its awful its antichristian  mary if you only knew them uncle what an example you would make but tell me is it not strange that men should dare such things in the midst of a city and nothing nothing be known of themnothing at all  leslie little indeed but we do know that there are several in the gang and that one at least is an unrivalled workman  lawson yere right sir

doorsand i find them bunglers why i could do it better myself  leslie gad brodie you and i might go into partnership i back myself to watch outside and i suppose you could do the work of skill within  brodie an opposition company leslie your mind is full of good things suppose we begin tonight and give the procurators house the honours of our innocence  mary you could do anything you two  lawson

tunbridge wells   the action occupies a space of ten hours     prologue    to all and singular as dryden says   we bring a fancy of those georgian days   whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume   of oldworld courtliness and oldworld bloom   when speech was elegant and talk was fit   for slang had not been canonised as wit   when manners reigned when breeding had the wall   and womenyeswere ladies first of all   when grace was conscious of its gracefulness   and manthough manwas not ashamed to dress   a brave formality a measured ease   were hisand herswhose effort was to please   and to excel in pleasing was to reign   and if you sighed never to sigh in vain    but then as nowit may be something more   woman and man were human to the core   the hearts that throbbed behind that quaint attire   burned with a plenitude of essential fire   they too could risk they also could rebel   they could love wiselythey could love too well   in that great duel of sex that ancient strife   which is the very central fact of life   they couldand didengage it breath for breath   they couldand didget wounded unto death   as at all times since time for us began   woman was truly woman man was man   and joy and sorrow were as much at home   in trifling tunbridge as in mighty rome    deaddead and done with swift from shine to shade   the roaring generations flit and fade

miss fosters apartments at the wells doors l   and c a window lc looking on the street a table r laid for   breakfast     scene i    barbara to her miss foster  barbara out of window mr menteith mr menteith mr menteithdrat his old head will nothing make him hearmr menteith  miss foster entering barbara this is incredible after all my lessons to be leaning from the window and calling for unless my ears deceived me you were positively calling into the street  barbara well madam just wait until you hear who it was i declare it was much more for miss dorothy and yourself than for me and if it was a little countrified i had a good excuse  miss foster nonsense child at least who was it  barbara miss evelina i was sure you would ask well what do you think i was looking out of the window at the barbers opposite  miss foster of which i entirely disapprove  barbara and first there came out two of the most beautifulthe royal livery madam  miss foster of course of course the duke of york arrived last night i trust you did not hail the dukes footmen  barbara o no madam it was after they were gone then who should come outbut youll never guess  miss foster i shall certainly not try  barbara mr menteith himself  miss foster why child i never heard of him  barbara o madam not the beaus own gentleman  miss foster mr austins servant no is it possible by that george austin must be here  barbara no doubt of that madam theyre never far apart he came out feeling his chin madam so and a packet of letters under his arm so and he had the beaus own walk to that degree you couldnt tell his back from his masters  miss foster my dear barbara you too frequently forget yourself a young woman in your position must beware of levity  barbara madam i know it but la what are you to make of me look at the time and trouble dear miss dorothy was always takingshe that trained up everybodyand see whats come of it barbara ridley i was and barbara ridley i am and i dont do with fashionable waysi cant do with them and indeed miss evelina i do sometimes wish we were all back again on edenside and mr anthony a boy again and dear miss dorothy her old self galloping the bay mare along the moor and taking care of all of us as if she was our mother bless her heart  miss foster miss dorothy herself child well now you mention it tunbridge of late has scarcely seemed to suit her constitution she falls away has not a word to throw at a dog and is ridiculously pale well now mr austin has returned after six months of infidelity to the dear wells we shall all i hope be brightened up has the mail come  barbara that it has madam and the sight of mr menteith put it clean out of my head with letters four for you miss evelina two for me and only one for miss dorothy miss dorothy seems quite neglected does she not six months ago it was a different story  miss foster well and thats true barbara and i had not remarked it i must take her seriously to task no young lady in her position should neglect her correspondence opening a letter heres from that dear ridiculous boy the cornet announcing his arrival for today  barbara o madam will he come in his red coat  miss foster i could not conceive him missing such a chance youth child is always vain and mr anthony is unusually young  barbara la madam he cant help that  miss foster my child i am not so sure mr anthony is a great concern to me he was orphaned to be sure at ten years old and ever since he has been only as it were his sisters son dorothy did everything for him more indeed than i thought quite ladylike but i suppose i begin to be oldfashioned see how she worked and slavedyes slavedfor him teaching him herself with what pains and patience she only could reveal and learning that she might be able and see what he is now a gentleman of course but to be frank a very commonplace one not what i had hoped of dorothys brother not what i had dreamed of the heir of two familiesmusgrave and foster child well he may now meet mr austin he requires a mr austin to embellish and correct his manners opening another letter why barbara mr john scrope and miss kate dacre are to be married  barbara la madam how nice  miss foster they are as im a sinful woman and when will you be married barbara and when dear dorothy i hate to see old maids amaking  barbara la miss evelina theres no harm in an old maid  miss foster you speak like a fool child sour grapes are all very well but its a womans business to be married as for dorothy she is fiveandtwenty and she breaks my heart such a match too ten thousand to her fortune the best blood in the north a most advantageous person all the graces the finest sensibility excellent judgment the foster walk and all these go positively abegging the men seem stricken with blindness why child when i came out and i was the dear girls image i had more swains at my feet in a fortnight than our dorothy ino i cannot fathom it it must be the girls own fault  barbara why madam i did think it was a case with mr austin  miss foster with mr austin why how very rustic the attentions of a gentleman like mr austin child are not supposed to lead to matrimony he is a feature of society an ornament a personage a private gentleman by birth but a kind of king by habit and reputation what woman could he marry those to whom he might properly aspire are all too far below him i have known george austin too long child and i understand that the very greatness of his success condemns him to remain unmarried  barbara sure madam that must be tiresome for him  miss foster some day child you will know better than to think so george austin as i conceive him and as he is regarded by the world is one of the triumphs of the other sex i walked my first minuet with him i wouldnt tell you the year child for worlds but it was soon after his famous encounter with colonel villiers he had killed his man he wore pink and silver was most elegantly pale and the most ravishing creature  barbara well madam i believe that he is the most beautiful gentleman still     scene ii    to these dorothy l  dorothy entering goodmorning aunt is there anything for me she goes eagerly to table and looks at letters  miss foster goodmorrow niece breakfast barbara  dorothy with letter unopened nothing  miss foster and what do you call that my dear sitting is john fenwick nobody  dorothy looking at letter from john o yes so it is lays letter down unopened and sits to breakfast barbara waiting  miss foster to barbara with plate thanks child now you may give me some tea dolly i must insist on your eating a good breakfast i cannot away with your pale cheeks and that patienceonamonument kind of look toast barbara at edenside you ate and drank and looked like hebe what have you done with your appetite  dorothy i dont know aunt im sure  miss foster then consider please and recover it as soon as you can to a young lady in your position a good appetite is an attractionalmost a virtue do you know that your brother arrives this morning  dorothy dear anthony where is his letter aunt evelina i am pleased that he should leave london and its perils if only for a day  miss foster my dear there are moments when you positively amaze me barbara some pâté if you please i beg you not to be a prude all women of course are virtuous but a prude is something i regard with abhorrence the cornet is seeing life which is exactly what he wanted you brought him up surprisingly well i have always admired you for it but let us admitas women of the world my dearit was no upbringing for a man you and that fine solemn fellow john fenwick led a life that was positively no better than the middle ages and between the two of you poor anthony who i am sure was a most passive creature was so packed with principle and admonition that i vow and declare he reminded me of issachar stooping between his two burdens it was high time for him to be done with your apronstring my dear he has all his wild oats to sow and that is an occupation which it is unwise to defer too long by the bye have you heard the news the duke of york has done us a service for which i was unprepared more tea barbara george austin bringing the prince in his train is with us once more  dorothy i knew he was coming  miss foster you knew child and did not tell you are a public criminal  dorothy i did not think it mattered aunt evelina  miss foster o do not makebelieve i am in love with him myself and have been any time since nelson and the nile as for you dolly since he went away six months ago you have been positively in the megrims i shall date your loss of appetite from george austins vanishing no my dear our family require entertainment we must have wit about us and beauty and the bel air  barbara well miss dorothy perhaps its out of my place but i do hope mr austin will come i should love to have him see my necklace on  dorothy necklace what necklace did he give you a necklace  barbara yes indeed miss that he did the very same day he drove you in his curricle to penshurst you remember miss i couldnt go  dorothy i remember  miss foster and so do i i had a touch of  foster in the blood the family gout dears and you you ungrateful nymph had him a whole day to yourself and not a word to tell me when you returned  dorothy i remember rising is that the necklace barbara it does not suit you give it me  barbara la miss dorothy i wouldnt for the world  dorothy come give it me i want it thank you you shall have my birthday pearls instead  miss foster why dolly i believe youre jealous of the maid foster foster always a foster trick to wear the willow in anger  dorothy i do not think madam that i am of a jealous habit  miss foster o the personage is your excuse and i can tell you child that when george austin was playing florizel to the duchesss perdita all the maids in england fell a prey to greeneyed melancholy it was the ton you see not to pine for that sylvander was to resign from good society  dorothy aunt evelina stop i cannot endure to hear you what is he after all but just beau austin what has he donewith half a century of good health what has he done that is either memorable or worthy diced and danced and set fashions vanquished in a drawingroom fought for a word what else as if these were the meaning of life do not make me think so poorly of all of us women sure we can rise to admire a better kind of man than mr austin we are not all to be snared with the eye dear aunt and those that areo i know not whether i more hate or pity them  miss foster you will give me leave my niece such talk is neither becoming in a young lady nor creditable to your understanding the world was made a great while before miss dorothy musgrave and you will do much better to ripen your opinions and in the meantime read your letter which i perceive you have not opened dorothy opens and reads letter barbara child you should not listen at table  barbara sure madam i hope i know my place  miss foster then do not do it again  dorothy poor john fenwick he coming here  miss foster well and why not dorothy my darling child you give me pain you never had but one chance let me tell you pointedly and that was john fenwick if i were you i would not let my vanity so blind me this is not the way to marry  dorothy dear aunt i shall never marry  miss foster a fiddlesticks end every one must marry rising are you for the pantiles  dorothy not today dear  miss foster well well have your wish dolorosabarbara attend and dress me     scene iii  dorothy how she tortures me poor

you should recognise me for a gentleman  austin the preliminary sir is somewhat grave  fenwick my business is both grave and delicate  austin menteith my good fellow exit menteith mr fenwick honour me so far as to be seated they sit i await your pleasure  fenwick briefly sir i am come not without hope to appeal to your good heart  austin from miss musgrave  fenwick no sir i abused her name and am here upon my own authority upon me the consequence  austin proceed  fenwick mr austin dorothy musgrave is the oldest and dearest of my friends is the lady whom for ten years it has been my hope to make my wife she has shown me reason to discard that hope for another that i may call her mrs austin  austin in the best interests of the lady rising i question if you have been well inspired you are aware sir that from such interference there is but one issue to whom shall i address my friend  fenwick mr austin i am here to throw myself upon your mercy strange as my errand is it will seem yet more strange to you that i came prepared to accept at your hands any extremity of dishonour and not fight the lady whom it is my boast to serve has honoured me with her commands these are my law and by these your life is sacred  austin then sir with his hand upon the bell this conversation becomes impossible you have me at too gross a disadvantage and as you are a gentleman and respect another i would suggest that you retire  fenwick sir you speak of disadvantage think of mine all my life long with all the forces of my nature i have loved this lady i came here to implore her to be my wife to be my queen my saint she had been always she was too noble to deceive me she told me what you know i will not conceal that my first mood was of anger i would have killed you like a dog but mr austinbear with me a whilei on the threshold of my life who have made no figure in the world nor ever shall now who had but one treasure and have lost itif i abandoning revenge trampling upon jealousy can supplicate you to complete my misfortuneo mr austin you who have lived you whose gallantry is beyond the insolence of a suspicion you who are a man crowned and acclaimed who are loved and loved by such a womanyou who excel me in every point of advantage will you suffer me to surpass you in generosity  austin you speak from the heart sits what do you want with me  fenwick marry her  austin mr fenwick i am the older man i have seen much of life much of society much of love when i was young it was expected of a gentleman to be ready with his hat to a lady ready with his sword to a man to honour his word and his king to be courteous with his equals generous to his dependants helpful and trusty in friendship but it was not asked of us to be quixotic if i had married every lady by whom it is my fortunenot my meritto have been distinguished the wells would scarce be spacious enough for my establishment you see sir that while i respect your emotion i am myself conducted by experience and besides mr fenwick is not love a warfare has it not rules have not our fair antagonists their tactics their weapons their place of arms and is there not a touch ofpardon me the word of silliness in one who having fought and having vanquished sounds a parley and capitulates to his own prisoner had the lady chosen had the fortune of war been other tis like she had been mrs austin now you know the world  fenwick i know sir that the world contains much cowardice to find mr austin afraid to do the right this surprises me  austin afraid child  fenwick yes sir afraid you know her you know if she be worthy and you answer me withthe world the world which has been at your feet the world which mr austin knows so well how to value and is so able to rule  austin i have lived long enough mr fenwick to recognise that the world is a great power it can make but it can break  fenwick sir suffer me you spoke but now of friendship and spoke warmly have you forgotten colonel villiers  austin mr fenwick mr fenwick you forget what i have suffered  fenwick o sir i know you loved him and yet for a random word you quarrelled friendship was weighed in vain against the worlds code of honour you fought and your friend fell i have heard from others how he lay long in agony and how you watched and nursed him and it was in your embrace he died in gods name have you forgotten that was not this sacrifice enough or must the world once again step between mr austin and his generous heart  austin good god sir i believe you are in the right i believe upon my soul i believe there is something in what you say  fenwick something mr austin o credit me the whole difference betwixt good and evil  austin nay nay but there you go too far there are many kinds of good honour is a diamond cut in a thousand facets and with the true fire in each thus and with all our differences mr fenwick you and i can still respect we can still admire each other  fenwick bear with me still sir if i ask you what is the end of life but to excel in generosity to pity the weak to comfort the afflicted to right where we have wronged to be brave in reparationthese noble elements you have for of what besides is the fabric of your dealing with colonel villiers that is mans chivalry to man yet to a suffering womana woman feeble betrayed unconsoledyou deny your clemency you refuse your aid you proffer injustice for atonement nay you are so disloyal to yourself that you can choose to be ungenerous and unkind where sir is the honour what facet of the diamond is that  austin you forget sir you forget but go on  fenwick o sir not inot i but yourself forgets george austin forgets george austin a woman loved by him betrayed by him abandoned by himthat woman suffers and a point of honour keeps him from his place at her feet she has played and lost and the world is with him if he deign to exact the stakes is that the mr austin whom miss musgrave honoured with her trust then sir how miserably was she deceived  austin childchild  fenwick mr austin still bear with me still follow me o sir will you not picture that dear ladys life her years how few her error thus irreparable what henceforth can be her portion but remorse the consciousness of selfabasement the shame of knowing that her trust was illbestowed to think of it this was a queen among women and thisthis is george austins work sir let me touch your heart let me prevail with you to feel that tis impossible  austin i am a gentleman what do you ask of me  fenwick to be the man she loved to be clement where the world would have you triumph to be of equal generosity with the vanquished to be worthy of her sacrifice and of yourself  austin mr fenwick your reproof is harsh  fenwick interrupting him o sir be just be just  austin but it is merited and i thank you for its utterance you tell me that the true victory comes when the fight is won that our foe is never so noble nor so dangerous as when she is fallen that the crowning triumph is that we celebrate over our conquering selves sir you are right kindness ay kindness after all and with age to become clement yes ambition first then the rounded vanityvictory still novel and last as you say the royal mood of the mature man to abdicate for others sir you touched me hard about my dead friend still harder about my living duty and i am not so young but i can take a lesson there is my hand upon it she shall be my wife  fenwick ah mr austin i was sure of it  austin then sir you were vastly mistaken there is nothing of beau austin here i have simply my dear child sate at the feet of mr fenwick  fenwick ah sir your heart was counsellor enough  austin pardon me i am vain enough to be the judge there are but two people in the world who could have wrought this change yourself and that dear lady touches bell suffer me to dismiss you one instant of toilet and i follow will you do me the honour to go before and announce my approach enter menteith  fenwick sir if my admiration

ladies for the world  miss foster dont mind me my dear go on  anthony really maam you must pardon me i trust i understand what topics are to be avoided among femalesand before my sister too a girl of her age  dorothy why you dear silly fellow im old enough to be your mother  anthony my dear dolly you do not understand you are not a man of the world but as i was going on to say there is no more spicy regiment in the service  miss foster i am not surprised that it maintains its old reputation you know my dear to dorothy it was george austins regiment  dorothy was it aunt  anthony beau austin yes it was and a precious dust they make about him stilla parcel of old frumps thats why i went to see him but hes quite extinct he couldnt be corinthian if he tried  miss foster i am afraid that even at your age george austin held a very different position from the distinguished anthony musgrave  anthony come maam i take that unkindly of course i know what youre at of course the old put cut no end of a dash with the duchess  miss foster my dear child i was thinking of no such thing that was immoral  anthony then you mean that affair at brighton when he cut the prince about perdita robinson

for his ungentlemanly conduct however thats all one what i want is to make aunt evelina understand that im not the man to be put down by an old maid whos been brought up in a workbasket begad ive had nothing but rebuffs all day its very remarkable there was that man austin to begin with ill be hanged if i can stand him i hear too much of him and if i can only get a good excuse to put him to the door i believe it would give dorothy and all of us a kind of a position after all hes not a man to visit in the house of ladies not when im away at least nothing in it of course but is he a man whose visits i can sanction     scene iv    anthony barbara  barbara please mr anthony miss foster said i was to show your room  anthony ah baby now you come here youre a girl of sense i know  barbara la mr

my errand mr musgrave is to your fair sister beauty as you know comes before valour  anthony in my own house and about my own sister i presume i have the right to ask for something more explicit  austin the right my dear sir is beyond question but it is one as you were going on to observe on which no gentleman insists  fenwick anthony my good fellow i think we had better go  anthony i have asked a question  austin which i was charmed to answer but which on repetition might begin to grow distasteful  anthony in my own house  fenwick for gods sake anthony  austin in your aunts house young

excellent health an excellent temper and the purest ardour of affection for your person i found not on my merits but on your indulgence miss musgrave will you honour me with your hand in marriage  dorothy mr austin if i thought basely of marriage i should perhaps accept your offer there was a time indeed when it would have made me proudest among women i was the more deceived and have to thank you for a salutary lesson you chose to count me as a cipher in your rolls of conquest for six months you left me to my fate and you come here todayprompted i doubt not by an honourable impulseto offer this tardy reparation no it is too late  austin do you refuse  dorothy yours is the blame we are no longer equal you have robbed me of the right to marry any one but you and do you think me then so poor in spirit as to accept a husband on compulsion  austin dorothy you loved me once  dorothy ay you will never guess how much you will never live to understand how ignominious a defeat that conquest was i loved and trusted you i judged you by myself think then of my humiliation when at the touch of trial all your qualities proved false and i beheld you the slave of the meanest vanityselfish untrue base think sir what a humbling of my pride to have been thus deceived to have taken for my idol such a commonplace imposture as yourself to have lovedyes lovedsuch a shadow such a mockery of man and now i am unworthy to be the wife of any gentleman and youlook me in the face georgeare you worthy to be my husband  austin no dorothy i am not i was a vain fool i blundered away the most precious opportunity and my regret will be lifelong do me the justice to accept this full confession of my fault i am here today to own and to repair it  dorothy repair it sir you condescend too far  austin i perceive with shame how grievously i had misjudged you but now dorothy believe me my eyes are opened i plead with you not as my equal but as one in all ways better than myself i admire you not in that trivial sense in which we men are wont to speak of women but as gods work as a wise mind a noble soul and a most generous heart from whose society i have all to gain all to learn dorothy in one word i love you  dorothy and what sir has wrought this transformation you knew me of old or thought you knew me is it in six months of selfish absence that your mind has changed when did that change begin a week ago sure you would have written today sir if this offer be anything more than fresh offence i have a right to be enlightened  austin madam i foresaw this question so be it i respect and i will not deceive you but give me first of all a moment for defence there are few men of my habits and position who would have done as i have done sate at the feet of a young boy accepted his lessons gone upon his errand fewer still who would thus at the crisis of a love risk the whole fortune of the soullove gratitude even respect yet more than that for conceive how i respect you if i whose lifelong trade has been flattery stand before you and make the plain confession of a truth that must not only lower me but deeply wound yourself  dorothy what means  austin young fenwick my rival for your heart he it was that sent me  dorothy he o disgrace he sent you that was what he meant am i fallen so low am i your common talk among men did you dice for me did he kneel o john john how could you and you mr austin whither have you brought me down shame heaping upon shameto what end o to what end  austin madam you wound me you look wilfully amiss sure any lady in the land might well be proud to be loved as you are loved with such nobility as mr fenwicks with such humility as mine i came indeed in pity in goodnature what you will see dearest lady with what honesty i speak if i win you it shall be with the unblemished truth all that is gone pity it is myself i pity i offer you not lovei am not worthy i ask i beseech of you suffer me to wait upon you like a servant to serve you with my rank my name the whole devotion of my life i am a gentlemanay in spite of my faultan upright gentleman and i swear to you that you shall order your life and mine at your free will dorothy at your feet in remorse in respect in loveo such love as i have never felt such love as i deridedi implore i conjure you to be mine  dorothy too late too late  austin no no not too late not too late for penitence not too late for love  dorothy which do you propose that i should abuse your compassion or reward your treachery george austin i have been your mistress and i will never be your wife  austin child dear child i have not told you all there is worse still your brother knows the boy as good as told me dorothy this is scandal at the dooro let that move you for that if not for my sake for that if not for love trust me trust me again  dorothy i am so much the more your victim that is all and shall that change my heart the sin must have its wages this too was done long ago when you stooped to lie to me the shame is still mine the fault still yours  austin child child you kill me you will not understand can you not see the lad will force me to a duel  dorothy and you will kill him shame after shame threat upon threat marry me or you are dishonoured marry me or your brother dies and this is mans honour but my honour and my pride are different i will encounter all misfortune sooner than degrade myself by an unfaithful marriage how should i kneel before the altar and vow to reverence as my husband you you who deceived me as my lover  austin dorothy you misjudge me cruelly i have deserved it you will not take me for your husband why should i wonder you are right i have indeed filled your life with calamity the wages ay the wages of my sin are heavy upon you but i have one more thing to ask of your pity and o remember child who it is that asks it a man guilty in your sight void of excuse but old and very proud and most unused to supplication dorothy musgrave will you forgive george austin  dorothy o george  austin it is the old name that is all i ask and more than i deserve i shall remember often remember how and where it was bestowed upon me for the last time i thank you dorothy from my heart a heart child that has been too long silent but is not too old i thank god not yet too old to learn a lesson and to accept a reproof i will not keep you longer i will goi am so bankrupt in credit that i dare not ask you to believe in how much sorrow but dorothy my acts will speak for me with more persuasion if it be in my power you shall suffer no more through me i will avoid your brother i will leave this place i will leave england tomorrow you shall be no longer tortured with the neighbourhood of your ungenerous lover dorothy farewell     scene viii    dorothy

because you harbinger the beau sits l menteith standing over her  menteith honoured madam i have had the pleasure to serve mr george for more than thirty years this is a privilegea very great privilege i have beheld him in the first societies moving among the first rank of personages and none madam none outshone him  barbara i assure you madam when mr menteith took me to the play he talked so much of mr austin that i couldnt hear a word of mr kean  miss foster well well and very right that was the old school of service barbara which you would do well to imitatethis is a child menteith that i am trying to form  menteith quite so madam  miss foster and are we soon to see our princely guest menteith  menteith his royal highness madam i believe i may say quite so mr george will receive our gallant prince upon the pantiles looking at his watch in i should say a matter of twelve minutes from now such madam is mr georges order of the day  barbara i beg your pardon madam i am sure but are we really to see one of his majestys own brothers that will be pure o madam this is better than carlisle  miss foster the woodnote wild a loyal cumbrian menteith  menteith eh quite so madam  miss foster when she has seen as much of the royal family as you my good fellow she will find it vastly less entertaining  menteith yes madam indeed in these distinguished circles life is but a slavery none of the best set would relish tunbridge without mr george tunbridge and mr george if youll excuse my plainness madam are in a manner of speaking identified and indeed it was the dooks desire alone that brought us here  barbara what the duke o dear was it for that  menteith though to be sure madam mr george would always be charmed to find himself bowing among so many admired members of his own set  miss foster upon my word menteith mr austin is as fortunate in his servant as his reputation  menteith quite so madam but let me observe that the opportunities i have had of acquiring a knowledge of mr georges character have been positively unrivalled nobody knows mr george like his old attendant the goodness of that gentlemanbut madam you will soon be equally fortunate if as i understand it is to be a match  miss foster i hope menteith you are not taking leave of your senses is it possible you mean my niece  menteith madam i have the honour to congratulate you i put a second curl in mr

present my homage  miss foster a truce to compliments menteith your charming fellow there has set me positively crazy dear george austin is it true can it be true  austin madam if he has been praising your niece he has been well inspired if he was speaking as i spoke an hour ago myself i wish miss foster that he had held his tongue i have indeed offered myself to miss dorothy and she with the most excellent reason has refused me  miss foster is it possible why my dear george austin  then i suppose it is john fenwick after all  austin not one of us is worthy  miss foster this is the most amazing circumstance you take my breath away my niece refuse george austin why i give you my word i thought she had adored you a perfect scandal it positively must not get abroad  austin madam for that young lady i have a singular regard judge me as tenderly as you can and set it down if you must to an old mans vanityfor evelina we are no longer in the heyday of our youthjudge me as you will i should prefer to have it known  miss foster can you george austin you my youth was nothing i was a failure but for you no george you never can you never must be old you are the triumph of my generation george and of our old friendship too think of my first dance and my first partner and to have this storyno i could not bear to have it told of you  austin madam there are some ladies over whom it is a boast to have prevailed there are others whom it is a glory to have loved and i am so vain dear evelina that even thus i am proud to link my name with that of dorothy musgrave  miss foster george you are changed i would not know you  austin i scarce know myself but pardon me dear friend taking out his watch in less than four minutes our illustrious guest will descend amongst us and i observe mr

mr fenwick i have played and lost that noble lady justly incensed at my misconduct has condemned me under the burden of such a loss may i console myself with the esteem of mr fenwick  fenwick she refused you pardon me sir but was the fault not yours  austin perhaps to my shame i am no novice mr fenwick but i have never felt nor striven as today i went upon your errand but you may trust me sir before i had done i found it was my own until today i never rightly valued her sure she is fit to be a queen i have a remorse here at my heart to which i am a stranger o that was a brave life that was a great heart that i have ruined  fenwick ay sir indeed  austin but sir it is not to lament the irretrievable that i intrude myself upon your leisure there is something to be done to save at least to spare that lady you did not fail to observe the brother  fenwick no sir he knows all and being both intemperate and ignorant  austin surely i know i have to ask you then to find what friends you can among this company and if you have none to make them let everybody hear the news tell it if i may offer the suggestion with humour how mr austin somewhat upon the wane but still filled with sufficiency gloriously presumed and was most ingloriously set down by a young lady from the north the ladys name a secret which you will permit to be divined the laughthe position of the herowill make it circulateyou perceive i am in earnestand in this way i believe our young friend will find himself forestalled  fenwick mr austin i would not have dared to ask so much of you i will go further were the positions changed i should fear to follow your example  austin child child you could not afford it     scene iv    to these the royal duke c then immediately anthony l fenwick   crosses to miss

tableau  austin recovering his composure your royal highness suffer me to excuse the disrespect of this young gentleman he has so much apology and i have i hope so good a credit as incline me to accept this blow but i must beg of your highness and gentlemen all of you here present to bear with me while i will explain what is too capable of misconstruction i am the rejected suitor of this young gentlemans sister of miss dorothy musgrave a lady whom i singularly honour and esteem a word from whom if i could hope that word would fill my life with happiness i was not worthy of that lady when i was defeated in fair field i presumed to make advances through her maid see in how laughable a manner fate repaid me the waitinggirl derided the mistress denied and now comes in this very ardent champion who publicly insults me my vanity is cured you will judge it right i am persuaded all of you that i should accept my proper punishment in silence you my lord duke to pardon this young gentleman and you mr musgrave to spare me further provocation which i am determined to ignore  dorothy rushing forward falling at austins knees and seizing his hand george george it was for me my hero

sailing on you north and south atlantic such a weary sight of water and no land never an island for the poor lad to land upon but still gods there she takes down the telescope to dust it fathers

kit a pity you cant see yourself well no ill never be handsome brown i may be never handsome but im better than that if the proverbs true for im ten hundred thousand fathoms deep in love i bring you a faithful sailor what you dont think much of that for a curiosity well thats so youre right the rarity is in the girl thats worth it ten times over faithful i couldnt help it if i tried no sweetheart

nobody kiss me no i wont kiss you kiss me ill give you a present for that see  arethusa a weddingring  kit my mothers will you take it  arethusa yes will iand give myself for it  kit ah if we could only count upon your father hes a man every inch of him but he cant endure kit french  arethusa he hasnt learned to know you kit as i have nor yet do you know him he seems hard and violent at heart he is only a man overwhelmed with sorrow why else when he looks at me and does not know that i observe him should his face change and fill with such tenderness that i could weep to see him why when he walks in his sleep as he does almost every night his eyes open and beholding nothing why should he cry so pitifully on my mothers name ah if you could hear him then you would say yourself here is a man that has loved here is a man that will be kind to lovers  kit is that so ay its a hard thing to lose your wife ay that must cut the heart indeed but for all that my lass your father is keen for the doubloons  arethusa right kit and small blame to him there is only one way to be honest and the name of that is thrift  kit well and thats my motto ive left the ship no more letters of marque for me goodbye to kit french privateersmans mate and howdyedo to christopher the coasting skipper ive seen the very boat for me ive enough to buy her too and to furnish a good house and keep a shot in the locker for bad luck so far theres nothing to gainsay so far its hopeful enough but still theres admiral guinea you knowand the plain truth is that im afraid of him  arethusa admiral guinea now kit if you are to be true lover of mine you shall not use that name his name is captain gaunt as for fearing him kit french youre not the man for me if you fear anything but sin hes a stern man because hes in the right  kit he is a man of god i am what he calls a child of perdition i was a privateersmanserving my country i say but he calls it pirate he is thrifty and sober he has a treasure they say and it lies so near his heart that he tumbles up in his sleep to stand watch over it what has a harumscarum dog like me to expect from a man like him he wont see im starving for a chance to mend mend hell say ill be shot if you mend at the expense of my daughter and the worst of it is you see hell be right  arethusa kit if you dare to say that fainthearted word again ill take my ring off what are we for but to grow better or grow worse do you think arethusa french will be the same as arethusa gaunt  kit i dont want her better  arethusa ah but she shall be  kit hark here he is by george its neck

the strength of my good honest love for her as you did for her mother and my father for mine and you know captain a man cant command the wind but excuse me sir he can always lie the best course possible and thats what ill do so god help me  gaunt arethusa you at least are the child of many prayers your eyes have been unsealed and to you the world stands naked a morning watch for duration a thing spun of cobwebs for solidity in the presence of an angry god i ask you have you heard this man  arethusa father i know kit and i love him  gaunt i say it solemnly this is no christian union to you christopher french i will speak nothing of eternal truths i will speak to you the language of this world you have been trained among sinners who gloried in their sin in your whole life you never saved one farthing and now when your pockets are full you think you can begin poor dupe in your own strength you are a roysterer a jovial companion you mean no harmyou are nobodys enemy but your own

plucked from the burning i look at you i read you through and through and i tell youno striking table with his fist  kit captain gaunt if you mean that i am not worthy of her im the first to say so but if youll excuse me sir im a young man and young men are no bettern they ought to be its known theyre all like that and whats their chance to be married to a girl like this and would you refuse it to me why sir you yourself when you came courting you were young and rough and yet ill make bold to say that mrs gaunt was a happy woman and the saving of yourself into the bargain well now captain gaunt will you deny another man and that man a sailor the very salvation that you had yourself  gaunt salvation christopher french is from above  kit well sir that is so but theres means too and what means so strong as the wife a man has to strive and toil for and that bears the punishment whenever he goes wrong now sir ive spoke with your old shipmates in the guinea trade hard as nails they said and true as the compass as rough as a slaver but as just as a judge well sir you hear me plead i ask you for my chance dont you deny it to me  gaunt you speak of me in the true balances we both weigh nothing but two things i know the depth of iniquity how foul it is and the agony with which a man repents not until seven devils were cast out of me did i awake each rent me as it passed ay that was repentance christopher christopher you have sailed before the wind since first you weighed your anchor and now you think to sail upon a bowline you do not know your ship young man you will go to leward like a sheet of paper i tell you so that knowi tell you so that have tried and failed and wrestled in the sweat of prayer and at last at last have tasted grace but meanwhile no flesh and blood of mine shall lie at the mercy of such a wretch as i was then or as you are this day i could not own the deed before the face of heaven if i sanctioned this unequal yoke arethusa pluck off that ring from off your finger christopher french take it and go hence  kit arethusa what do you say  arethusa o kit you know my heart but he is alone and i am his only comfort and i owe all to him and shall i not obey my father but kit if you will let me i will keep your ring go kit go and prove to my father that he was mistaken go and win me and o kit if ever you should weary come to meno do not come but

many kinds it is a little matter to endure the pangs of the flesh the smart of wounds the passion of hunger and thirst the heaviness of disease and in this world i have learned to take thought for nothing save the quiet of your soul it is through our affections that we are smitten with the true pain even the pain that kills  arethusa and yet this pain is our natural lot father i fear to boast but i know that i can bear it let my life then flow like common lives each pain rewarded with some pleasure each pleasure linked with some pain nothing pure whether for good or evil and my husband

 gaunt i married her from falmouth she was comely as the roe i see her stillher doves eyes and her smile i was older than she and i had a name for hardness a hard and wicked man but she loved memy hesterand she took me as i was o how i repaid her trust well our child was born to us and we named her after the brig i had built and sailed the old craft whose likenessolder than you girlstands there above our heads and so far that was happiness but she yearned for my salvation and it was there i thwarted her my sins were a burden upon her spirit a shame to her in this world her terror in the world to come she talked much and often of my leaving the devils trade i sailed in she had a tender and a christian heart and she would weep and pray for the poor heathen creatures that i bought and sold and shipped in misery till my conscience grew hot within me ive put on my hat and gone out and made oath that my next cargo should be my last but it never was that oath was never kept so i sailed again and again for the guinea coast until the trip came that was to be my last indeed well it fell out that we had good luck trading and i stowed the brig with these poor heathen as full as she would hold we had a fair run westward till we were past the line but one night the wind rose and there came a hurricane and for seven days we were tossed on the deep seas in the hardest straits and every hand on deck for several days they were battened down all that time we heard their cries and lamentations but worse at the beginning and when at last and near dead myself i crept belowo some they were starved some smothered some dead of broken limbs and the hold was like a lazarhouse in the time of the anger of the lord  arethusa o  gaunt it was two hundred and five that we threw overboard two hundred and five lost souls that i had hurried to their doom i had many die with me before but not like thatnot such a massacre as that and i stood dumb before the sight for i saw i was their

still tell me of my sins and how the thought of them had bowed down her life and o she said if i couldnt prevail on you alive let my death well then she died what have i done since then ive laid my
