65159008	the patagonia by henry james   chapter i   the houses were dark in the august night and the perspective of beacon street with its double chain of lamps was a foreshortened desert  the club on the hill alone from its semicylindrical front projected a glow upon the dusky vagueness of the common and as i passed it i heard in the hot stillness the click of a pair of billiardballs  as every one was out of town perhaps the servants in the extravagance of their leisure were profaning the tables  the heat was insufferable and i thought with joy of the morrow of the deck of the steamer the freshening breeze the sense of getting out to sea  i was even glad of what i had learned in the afternoon at the office of the companythat at the eleventh hour an old ship with a lower standard of speed had been put on in place of the vessel in which i had taken my passage  america was roasting england might very well be stuffy and a slow passage which at that season of the year would probably also be a fine one was a guarantee of ten or twelve days of fresh air  i strolled down the hill without meeting a creature though i could see through the palings of the common that that recreative expanse was peopled with dim forms  i remembered mrs nettlepoints houseshe lived in those days they are not so distant but there have been changes on the waterside a little way beyond the spot at which the public garden terminates and i reflected that like myself she would be spending the night in boston if it were true that as had been mentioned to me a few days before at mount desert she was to embark on the morrow for liverpool  i presently saw this appearance confirmed by a light above her door and in two or three of her windows and i determined to ask for her having nothing to do till bedtime  i had come out simply to pass an hour leaving my hotel to the blaze of its gas and the perspiration of its porters but it occurred to me that my old friend might very well not know of the substitution of the patagonia for the scandinavia so that i should be doing her a service to prepare her mind  besides i could offer to help her to look after her in the morning lone women are grateful for support in taking ship for far countries  it came to me indeed as i stood on her doorstep that as she had a son she might not after all be so lone yet i remembered at the same time that jasper nettlepoint was not quite a young man to lean upon havingas i at least supposeda life of his own and tastes and habits which had long since diverted him from the maternal side  if he did happen just now to be at home my solicitude would of course seem officious for in his many wanderingsi believed he had roamed all over the globehe would certainly have learned how to manage  none the less in fine i was very glad to show mrs nettlepoint i thought of her  with my long absence i had lost sight of her but i had liked her of old she had been a good friend to my sisters and i had in regard to her that sense which is pleasant to those who in general have gone astray or got detached the sense that she at least knew all about me  i could trust her at any time to tell people i was respectable  perhaps i was conscious of how little i deserved this indulgence when it came over me that i hadnt been near her for ages  the measure of that neglect was given by my vagueness of mind about jasper  however i really belonged nowadays to a different generation i was more the mothers contemporary than the sons  mrs nettlepoint was at home i found her in her back drawingroom where the wide windows opened to the water  the room was duskyit was too hot for lampsand she sat slowly moving her fan and looking out on the little arm of the sea which is so pretty at night reflecting the lights of cambridgeport and charlestown  i supposed she was musing on the loved ones she was to leave behind her married daughters her grandchildren but she struck a note more specifically bostonian as she said to me pointing with her fan to the back bay i shall see nothing more charming than that over there you know  she made me very welcome but her son had told her about the patagonia for which she was sorry as this would mean a longer voyage  she was a poor creature in any boat and mainly confined to her cabin even in weather extravagantly termed fineas if any weather could be fine at sea  ah then your sons going with you i asked  here he comes hell tell you for himself much better than i can pretend to  jasper nettlepoint at that moment joined us dressed in white flannel and carrying a large fan  well my dear have you decided his mother continued with no scant irony  he hasnt yet made up his mind and we sail at ten oclock  what does it matter when my things are put up the young man said theres no crowd at this moment there will be cabins to spare  im waiting for a telegramthat will settle it  i just walked up to the club to see if it was cometheyll send it there because they suppose this house unoccupied  not yet but i shall go back in twenty minutes  mercy how you rush about in this temperature the poor lady exclaimed while i reflected that it was perhaps his billiardballs i had heard ten minutes before  i was sure he was fond of billiards  rush not in the least  i take it uncommon easy  ah im bound to say you do mrs nettlepoint returned with inconsequence  i guessed at a certain tension between the pair and a want of consideration on the young mans part arising perhaps from selfishness  his mother was nervous in suspense wanting to be at rest as to whether she should have his company on the voyage or be obliged to struggle alone  but as he stood there smiling and slowly moving his fan he struck me somehow as a person on whom this fact wouldnt sit too heavily  he was of the type of those whom other people worry about not of those who worry about other people  tall and strong he had a handsome face with a round head and closecurling hair the whites of his eyes and the enamel of his teeth under his brown moustache gleamed vaguely in the lights of the back bay  i made out that he was sunburnt as if he lived much in the open air and that he looked intelligent but also slightly brutal though not in a morose way  his brutality if he had any was bright and finished  i had to tell him who i was but even then i saw how little he placed me and that my explanations gave me in his mind no great identity or at any rate no great importance  i foresaw that he would in intercourse make me feel sometimes very young and sometimes very old caring himself but little which  he mentioned as if to show our companion that he might safely be left to his own devices that he had once started from london to bombay at three quarters of an hours notice  yes and it must have been pleasant for the people you were with  oh the people i was with he returned and his tone appeared to signify that such people would always have to come off as they could  he asked if there were no cold drinks in the house no lemonade no iced syrups in such weather something of that sort ought always to be kept going  when his mother remarked that surely at the club they were kept going he went on oh yes i had various things there but you know ive walked down the hill since  one should have something at either end  may i ring and see  he rang while mrs nettlepoint observed that with the people they had in the house an establishment reduced naturally at such a moment to its simplest expressionthey were burning up candleends and there were no luxuriesshe wouldnt answer for the service  the matter ended in her leaving the room in quest of cordials with the female domestic who had arrived in response to the bell and in whom jaspers appeal aroused no visible intelligence  she remained away some time and i talked with her son who was sociable but desultory and kept moving over the place always with his fan as if he were properly impatient  sometimes he seated himself an instant on the windowsill and then i made him out in fact thoroughly goodlookinga fine brown clean young athlete  he failed to tell me on what special contingency his decision depended he only alluded familiarly to an expected telegram and i saw he was probably fond at no time of the trouble of explanations  his mothers absence was a sign that when it might be a question of gratifying him she had grown used to spare no pains and i fancied her rummaging in some close storeroom among old preservepots while the dull maidservant held the candle awry  i dont know whether this same vision was in his own eyes at all events it didnt prevent his saying suddenly as he looked at his watch that i must excuse himhe should have to go back to the club  he would return in half an houror in less  he walked away and i sat there alone conscious on the dark dismantled simplified scene in the deep silence that rests on american towns during the hot seasonthere was now and then a far cry or a plash in the water and at intervals the tinkle of the bells of the horsecars on the long bridge slow in the suffocating nightof the strange influence halfsweet halfsad that abides in houses uninhabited or about to become so in places muffled and bereaved where the unheeded sofas and patient belittered tables seem like the disconcerted dogs to whom everything is alike sinister to recognise the eve of a journey  after a while i heard the sound of voices of steps the rustle of dresses and i looked round supposing these things to denote the return of mrs nettlepoint and her handmaiden with the refection prepared for her son  what i saw however was two other female forms visitors apparently just admitted and now ushered into the room  they were not announcedthe servant turned her back on them and rambled off to our hostess  they advanced in a wavering tentative unintroduced waypartly i could see because the place was dark and partly because their visit was in its nature experimental a flight of imagination or a stretch of confidence  one of the ladies was stout and the other slim and i made sure in a moment that one was talkative and the other reserved  it was further to be discerned that one was elderly and the other young as well as that the fact of their unlikeness didnt prevent their being mother and daughter  mrs nettlepoint reappeared in a very few minutes but the interval had sufficed to establish a communicationreally copious for the occasionbetween the strangers and the unknown gentleman whom they found in possession hat and stick in hand  this was not my doingfor what had i to go uponand still less was it the doing of the younger and the more indifferent or less courageous lady  she spoke but oncewhen her companion informed me that she was going out to europe the next day to be married  then she protested oh mother in a tone that struck me in the darkness as doubly odd exciting my curiosity to see her face  it had taken the elder woman but a moment to come to that and to various other things after i had explained that i myself was waiting for mrs nettlepoint who would doubtless soon come back  well she wont know mei guess she hasnt ever heard much about me the good lady said but ive come from mrs allen and i guess that will make it all right  i presume you know mrs allen  i was unacquainted with this influential personage but i assented vaguely to the proposition  mrs allens emissary was goodhumoured and familiar but rather appealing than insistent she remarked that if her friend had found time to come in the afternoonshe had so much to do being just up for the day that she couldnt be sureit would be all right and somehow even before she mentioned merrimac avenue they had come all the way from there my imagination had associated her with that indefinite social limbo known to the properlyconstituted boston mind as the south enda nebulous region which condenses here and there into a pretty face in which the daughters are an improvement on the mothers and are sometimes acquainted with gentlemen more gloriously domiciled gentlemen whose wives and sisters are in turn not acquainted with them  when at last mrs nettlepoint came in accompanied by candles and by a tray laden with glasses of coloured fluid which emitted a cool tinkling i was in a position to officiate as master of the ceremonies to introduce mrs mavis and miss grace mavis to represent that mrs allen had recommended themnay had urged themjust to come that way informally and without fear mrs allen who had been prevented only by the pressure of occupations so characteristic of her especially when up from mattapoisett for a few hours desperate shopping from herself calling in the course of the day to explain who they were and what was the favour they had to ask of her benevolent friend  goodnatured women understand each other even when so divided as to sit residentially above and below the salt as who should say by which token our hostess had quickly mastered the main facts mrs allens visit that morning in merrimac avenue to talk of mrs ambers great idea the classes at the public schools in vacation she was interested with an equal charity to that of mrs maviseven in such weatherin those of the south end for games and exercises and music to keep the poor unoccupied children out of the streets then the revelation that it had suddenly been settled almost from one hour to the other that grace should sail for liverpool mr porterfield at last being ready  he was taking a little holiday his mother was with him they had come over from paris to see some of the celebrated old buildings in england and he had telegraphed to say that if grace would start right off they would just finish it up and be married  it often happened that when things had dragged on that way for years they were all huddled up at the end  of course in such a case she mrs mavis had had to fly round  her daughters passage was taken but it seemed too dreadful she should make her journey all alone the first time she had ever been at sea without any companion or escort  she couldnt gomr mavis was too sick she hadnt even been able to get him off to the seaside  well mrs nettlepoints going in that ship mrs allen had said and she had represented that nothing was simpler than to give her the girl in charge  when mrs mavis had replied that this was all very well but that she didnt know the lady mrs allen had declared that that didnt make a speck of difference for mrs nettlepoint was kind enough for anything it was easy enough to know her if that was all the trouble  all mrs mavis would have to do would be to go right up to her next morning when she took her daughter to the ship she would see her there on the deck with her party and tell her fair and square what she wanted  mrs nettlepoint had daughters herself and would easily understand  very likely shed even look after grace a little on the other side in such a queer situation going out alone to the gentleman she was engaged to shed just help her like a good samaritan to turn round before she was married  mr porterfield seemed to think they wouldnt wait long once she was there they would have it right over at the american consuls mrs allen had said it would perhaps be better still to go and see mrs nettlepoint beforehand that day to tell her what they wanted then they wouldnt seem to spring it on her just as she was leaving  she herself mrs allen would call and say a word for them if she could save ten minutes before catching her train  if she hadnt come it was because she hadnt saved her ten minutes but she had made them feel that they must come all the same  mrs mavis liked that better because on the ship in the morning there would be such a confusion  she didnt think her daughter would be any troubleconscientiously she didnt  it was just to have some one to speak to her and not sally forth like a servantgirl going to a situation  i see im to act as a sort of bridesmaid and to give her away mrs nettlepoint obligingly said  kind enough in fact for anything she showed on this occasion that it was easy enough to know her  there is notoriously nothing less desirable than an imposed aggravation of effort at sea but she accepted without betrayed dismay the burden of the young ladys dependence and allowed her as mrs mavis said to hook herself on  she evidently had the habit of patience and her reception of her visitors story reminded me afreshi was reminded of it whenever i returned to my native landthat my dear compatriots are the people in the world who most freely take mutual accommodation for granted  they have always had to help themselves and have rather magnanimously failed to learn just where helping others is distinguishable from that  in no country are there fewer forms and more reciprocities  it was doubtless not singular that the ladies from merrimac avenue shouldnt feel they were importunate what was striking was that mrs nettlepoint didnt appear to suspect it  however she would in any case have thought it inhuman to show thisthough i could see that under the surface she was amused at everything the more expressive of the pilgrims from the south end took for granted  i scarce know whether the attitude of the younger visitor added or not to the merit of her good nature  mr porterfields intended took no part in the demonstration scarcely spoke sat looking at the back bay and the lights on the long bridge  she declined the lemonade and the other mixtures which at mrs nettlepoints request i offered her while her mother partook freely of everything and i reflectedfor i as freely drained a glass or two in which the ice tinkledthat mr jasper had better hurry back if he wished to enjoy these luxuries  was the effect of the young womans reserve meanwhile ungracious or was it only natural that in her particular situation she shouldnt have a flow of compliment at her command  i noticed that mrs nettlepoint looked at her often and certainly though she was undemonstrative miss mavis was interesting  the candlelight enabled me to see that though not in the very first flower of her youth she was still fresh and handsome her eyes and hair were dark her face was pale and she held up her head as if with its thick braids and everything else involved in it it were an appurtenance she wasnt ashamed of  if her mother was excellent and common she was not commonnot at least flagrantly soand perhaps also not excellent  at all events she wouldnt be in appearance at least a dreary appendage which in the case of a person hooking on was always something gained  was it because something of a romantic or pathetic interest usually attaches to a good creature who has been the victim of a long engagement that this young lady made an impression on me from the firstfavoured as i had been so quickly with this glimpse of her history  i could charge her certainly with no positive appeal she only held her tongue and smiled and her smile corrected whatever suggestion might have forced itself upon me that the spirit within her was deadthe spirit of that promise of which she found herself doomed to carry out the letter  what corrected it less i must add was an odd recollection which gathered vividness as i listened to ita mental association evoked by the name of mr porterfield  surely i had a personal impression over smeared and confused of the gentleman who was waiting at liverpool or who presently would be for mrs nettlepoints protegee  i had met him known him some time somewhere somehow on the other side  wasnt he studying something very hard somewhereprobably in paristen years before and didnt he make extraordinarily neat drawings linear and architectural  didnt he go to a table dhote at two francs twentyfive in the rue bonaparte which i then frequented and didnt he wear spectacles and a scotch plaid arranged in a manner which seemed to say ive trustworthy information that thats the way they do it in the highlands  wasnt he exemplary to positive irritation and very poor poor to positive oppression so that i supposed he had no overcoat and his tartan would be what he slept under at night  wasnt he working very hard still and wouldnt he be in the natural course not yet satisfied that he had found his feet or knew enough to launch out  he would be a man of long preparationsmiss maviss white face seemed to speak to one of that  it struck me that if i had been in love with her i shouldnt have needed to lay such a train for the closer approach  architecture was his line and he was a pupil of the ecole des beaux arts  this reminiscence grew so much more vivid with me that at the end of ten minutes i had an odd sense of knowingby implicationa good deal about the young lady  even after it was settled that mrs nettlepoint would do everything possible for her the other visitor sat sipping our iced liquid and telling how low mr mavis had been  at this period the girls silence struck me as still more conscious partly perhaps because she deprecated her mothers free flowshe was enough of an improvement to measure thatand partly because she was too distressed by the idea of leaving her infirm her perhaps dying father  it wasnt indistinguishable that they were poor and that she would take out a very small purse for her trousseau  for mr porterfield to make up the sum his own case would have had moreover greatly to change  if he had enriched himself by the successful practice of his profession i had encountered no edifice he had rearedhis reputation hadnt come to my ears  mrs nettlepoint notified her new friends that she was a very inactive person at sea she was prepared to suffer to the full with miss mavis but not prepared to pace the deck with her to struggle with her to accompany her to meals  to this the girl replied that she would trouble her little she was sure she was convinced she should prove a wretched sailor and spend the voyage on her back  her mother scoffed at this picture prophesying perfect weather and a lovely time and i interposed to the effect that if i might be trusted as a tame bachelor fairly sea seasoned i should be delighted to give the new member of our party an arm or any other countenance whenever she should require it  both the ladies thanked me for thistaking my professions with no sort of abatementand the elder one declared that we were evidently going to be such a sociable group that it was too bad to have to stay at home  she asked mrs nettlepoint if there were any one else in our party and when our hostess mentioned her sonthere was a chance of his embarking but wasnt it absurd he hadnt decided yetshe returned with extraordinary candour oh dear i do hope hell go that would be so lovely for grace  somehow the words made me think of poor mr porterfields tartan especially as jasper nettlepoint strolled in again at that moment  his mother at once challenged him it was ten oclock had he by chance made up his great mind  apparently he failed to hear her being in the first place surprised at the strange ladies and then struck with the fact that one of them wasnt strange  the young man after a slight hesitation greeted miss mavis with a handshake and a oh goodevening how do you do  he didnt utter her namewhich i could see he must have forgotten but she immediately pronounced his availing herself of the american girls discretion to present him to her mother  well you might have told me you knew him all this time that lady jovially cried  then she had an equal confidence for mrs nettlepoint it would have saved me a worryan acquaintance already begun  ah my sons acquaintances our hostess murmured  yes and my daughters too mrs mavis gaily echoed  mrs allen didnt tell us you were going she continued to the young man  shed have been clever if she had been able to mrs nettlepoint sighed  dear mother i have my telegram jasper remarked looking at grace mavis  i know you very little the girl said returning his observation  ive danced with you at some ballfor some sufferers by something or other  i think it was an inundation or a big fire she a little languidly smiled  but it was a long time agoand i havent seen you since  ive been in far countriesto my loss  i should have said it was a big fire  it was at the horticultural hall  i didnt remember your name said grace mavis  thats very unkind of you when i recall vividly that you had a pink dress  oh i remember that dressyour strawberry tarletan you looked lovely in it mrs mavis broke out  you must get another just like iton the other side  yes your daughter looked charming in it said jasper nettlepoint  then he added to the girl yet you mentioned my name to your mother  it came back to meseeing you here  i had no idea this was your home  well i confess it isnt much  oh there are some drinkshe approached the tray and its glasses  indeed there are and quite deliciousmrs mavis largely wiped her mouth  wont you have another thena pink one like your daughters gown  with pleasure sir  oh do see them over mrs mavis continued accepting from the young mans hand a third tumbler  my mother and that gentleman  surely they can take care of themselves he freely pleaded  then my daughtershe has a claim as an old friend  but his mother had by this time interposed  jasper what does your telegram say  he paid her no heed he stood there with his glass in his hand looking from mrs mavis to miss grace  ah leave her to me madam im quite competent i said to mrs mavis  then the young man gave me his attention  the next minute he asked of the girl do you mean youre going to europe  yes tomorrow  in the same ship as your mother  thats what weve come here for to see all about it said mrs mavis  my son take pity on me and tell me what light your telegram throws mrs nettlepoint went on  i will dearest when ive quenched my thirst  and he slowly drained his glass  well i declare youre worse than gracie mrs mavis commented  she was first one thing and then the otherbut only about up to three oclock yesterday  excuse mewont you take something jasper inquired of gracie who however still declined as if to make up for her mothers copious consommation  i found myself quite aware that the two ladies would do well to take leave the question of mrs nettlepoints good will being so satisfactorily settled and the meeting of the morrow at the ship so near at hand and i went so far as to judge that their protracted stay with their hostess visibly in a fidget gave the last proof of their want of breeding  miss grace after all then was not such an improvement on her mother for she easily might have taken the initiative of departure in spite of mrs maviss evident game of making her own absorption of refreshment last as long as possible  i watched the girl with increasing interest i couldnt help asking myself a question or two about her and even perceiving already in a dim and general way that rather marked embarrassment or at least anxiety attended her  wasnt it complicating that she should have needed by remaining long enough to assuage a certain suspense to learn whether or no jasper were going to sail hadnt something particular passed between them on the occasion or at the period to which we had caught their allusion and didnt she really not know her mother was bringing her to his mothers though she apparently had thought it well not to betray knowledge  such things were symptomaticthough indeed one scarce knew of whaton the part of a young lady betrothed to that curious crossbarred phantom of a mr porterfield  but i am bound to add that she gave me no further warrant for wonder than was conveyed in her all tacitly and covertly encouraging her mother to linger  somehow i had a sense that she was conscious of the indecency of this  i got up myself to go but mrs nettlepoint detained me after seeing that my movement wouldnt be taken as a hint and i felt she wished me not to leave my fellow visitors on her hands jasper complained of the closeness of the room said that it was not a night to sit in a roomone ought to be out in the air under the sky  he denounced the windows that overlooked the water for not opening upon a balcony or a terrace until his mother whom he hadnt yet satisfied about his telegram reminded him that there was a beautiful balcony in front with room for a dozen people  she assured him we would go and sit there if it would please him  it will be nice and cool tomorrow when we steam into the great ocean said miss mavis expressing with more vivacity than she had yet thrown into any of her utterances my own thought of half an hour before  mrs nettlepoint replied that it would probably be freezing cold and her son murmured that he would go and try the drawingroom balcony and report upon it  just as he was turning away he said smiling to miss mavis wont you come with me and see if its pleasant  oh well we had better not stay all night her mother exclaimed but still without moving  the girl moved after a moments hesitationshe rose and accompanied jasper to the other room  i saw how her slim tallness showed to advantage as she walked and that she looked well as she passed with her head thrown back into the darkness of the other part of the house  there was something rather marked rather surprisingi scarcely knew why for the act in itself was simple enoughin her acceptance of such a plea and perhaps it was our sense of this that held the rest of us somewhat stiffly silent as she remained away  i was waiting for mrs mavis to go so that i myself might go and mrs nettlepoint was waiting for her to go so that i mightnt  this doubtless made the young ladys absence appear to us longer than it really wasit was probably very brief  her mother moreover i think had now a vague lapse from ease  jasper nettlepoint presently returned to the back drawingroom to serve his companion with our lucent syrup and he took occasion to remark that it was lovely on the balcony one really got some air the breeze being from that quarter  i remembered as he went away with his tinkling tumbler that from my hand a few minutes before miss mavis had not been willing to accept this innocent offering  a little later mrs nettlepoint said well if its so pleasant there we had better go ourselves  so we passed to the front and in the other room met the two young people coming in from the balcony  i was to wonder in the light of later things exactly how long they had occupied together a couple of the set of cane chairs garnishing the place in summer  if it had been but five minutes that only made subsequent events more curious  we must go mother miss mavis immediately said and a moment after with a little renewal of chatter as to our general meeting on the ship the visitors had taken leave  jasper went down with them to the door and as soon as they had got off mrs nettlepoint quite richly exhaled her impression  ah butll she be a boreshell be a bore of bores  not through talking too much surely  an affectation of silence is as bad  i hate that particular pose its coming up very much now an imitation of the english like everything else  a girl who tries to be statuesque at seathat will act on ones nerves  i dont know what she tries to be but she succeeds in being very handsome  so much the better for you  ill leave her to you for i shall be shut up  i like her being placed under my care my friend cried  shell be under jaspers i remarked  ah he wont go she wailedi want it too much  but i didnt see it that way  i have an idea hell go  why didnt he tell me so thenwhen he came in  he was diverted by that young womana beautiful unexpected girl sitting there  diverted from his mother and her fond hopehis mother trembling for his decision  welli pieced it togethershes an old friend older than we know it was a meeting after a long separation  yes such a lot of them as he does know mrs nettlepoint sighed  such a lot of them  he has so many female friendsin the most varied circles  well we can close round her then i returned for i on my side know or used to know her young man  her intendedshe had a light of relief for this  the very one shes going out to  he cant by the way it occurred to me be very young now  how odd it soundsher muddling after him said mrs nettlepoint  i was going to reply that it wasnt odd if you knew mr porterfield but i reflected that that perhaps only made it odder  i told my companion briefly who he wasthat i had met him in the old paris days when i believed for a fleeting hour that i could learn to paint when i lived with the jeunesse des ecoles and her comment on this was simply well he had better have come out for her  perhaps so  she looked to me as she sat there as if she might change her mind at the last moment  about her marriage  about sailing  but she wont change now  jasper came back and his mother instantly challenged him  well are you going  yes i shall gohe was finally at peace about it  ive got my telegram  oh your telegrami ventured a little to jeer  that charming girls your telegram  he gave me a look but in the dusk i couldnt make out very well what it conveyed  then he bent over his mother kissing her  my news isnt particularly satisfactory  im going for you  oh you humbug she replied  but she was of course delighted     chapter ii   people usually spend the first hours of a voyage in squeezing themselves into their cabins taking their little precautions either so excessive or so inadequate wondering how they can pass so many days in such a hole and asking idiotic questions of the stewards who appear in comparison rare men of the world  my own initiations were rapid as became an old sailor and so it seemed were miss maviss for when i mounted to the deck at the end of half an hour i found her there alone in the stern of the ship her eyes on the dwindling continent  it dwindled very fast for so big a place  i accosted her having had no conversation with her amid the crowd of leavetakers and the muddle of farewells before we put off we talked a little about the boat our fellowpassengers and our prospects and then i said i think you mentioned last night a name i knowthat of mr porterfield  oh no i didnt she answered very straight while she smiled at me through her closelydrawn veil  then it was your mother  very likely it was my mother  and she continued to smile as if i ought to have known the difference  i venture to allude to him because ive an idea i used to know him i went on  oh i see  and beyond this remark she appeared to take no interest she left it to me to make any connexion  that is if its the same one  it struck me as feeble to say nothing more so i added my mr porterfield was called david  well so is ours  ours affected me as clever  i suppose i shall see him again if hes to meet you at liverpool i continued  well it will be bad if he doesnt  it was too soon for me to have the idea that it would be bad if he did that only came later  so i remarked that not having seen him for so many years it was very possible i shouldnt know him  well ive not seen him for a considerable time but i expect i shall know him all the same  oh with you its different i returned with harmlessly bright significance  hasnt he been back since those days  i dont know she sturdily professed what days you mean  when i knew him in parisages ago  he was a pupil of the ecole des beaux arts  he was studying architecture  well hes studying it still said grace mavis  hasnt he learned it yet  i dont know what he has learned  i shall see  then she added for the benefit of my perhaps undue levity architectures very difficult and hes tremendously thorough  oh yes i remember that  he was an admirable worker  but he must have become quite a foreigner if its so many years since he has been at home  she seemed to regard this proposition at first as complicated but she did what she could for me  oh hes not changeable  if he were changeable  then however she paused  i daresay she had been going to observe that if he were changeable he would long ago have given her up  after an instant she went on he wouldnt have stuck so to his profession  you cant make much by it  i sought to attenuate her rather odd maidenly grimness  it depends on what you call much  it doesnt make you rich  oh of course youve got to practise itand to practise it long  yesso mr porterfield says  something in the way she uttered these words made me laughthey were so calm an implication that the gentleman in question didnt live up to his principles  but i checked myself asking her if she expected to remain in europe longto what one might call settle  well it will be a good while if it takes me as long to come back as it has taken me to go out  and i think your mother said last night that it was your first visit  miss mavis in her deliberate way met my eyes  didnt mother talk  it was all very interesting  she continued to look at me  you dont think that she then simply stated  what have i to gain then by saying it  oh men have always something to gain  you make me in that case feel a terrible failure  i hope at any rate that it gives you pleasure i went on the idea of seeing foreign lands  mercyi should think so  this was almost genial and it cheered me proportionately  its a pity our ships not one of the fast ones if youre impatient  she was silent a little after which she brought out oh i guess itll be fast enough  that evening i went in to see mrs nettlepoint and sat on her seatrunk which was pulled out from under the berth to accommodate me  it was nine oclock but not quite dark as our northward course had already taken us into the latitude of the longer days  she had made her nest admirably and now rested from her labours she lay upon her sofa in a dressinggown and a cap that became her  it was her regular practice to spend the voyage in her cabin which smelt positively goodsuch was the refinement of her art and she had a secret peculiar to herself for keeping her port open without shipping seas  she hated what she called the mess of the ship and the idea if she should go above of meeting stewards with plates of supererogatory food  she professed to be content with her situationwe promised to lend each other books and i assured her familiarly that i should be in and out of her room a dozen times a daypitying me for having to mingle in society  she judged this a limited privilege for on the deck before we left the wharf she had taken a view of our fellowpassengers  oh im an inveterate almost a professional observer i replied and with that vice im as well occupied as an old woman in the sun with her knitting  it makes me in any situation just inordinately and submissively see things  i shall see them even here and shall come down very often and tell you about them  youre not interested today but you will be tomorrow for a ships a great school of gossip  you wont believe the number of researches and problems youll be engaged in by the middle of the voyage  i  never in the worldlying here with my nose in a book and not caring a straw  youll participate at second hand  youll see through my eyes hang upon my lips take sides feel passions all sorts of sympathies and indignations  ive an idea i further developed that your young ladys the person on board who will interest me most  mine indeed  she hasnt been near me since we left the dock  there you areyou do feel she owes you something  well i added shes very curious  youve such coldblooded terms mrs nettlepoint wailed  elle ne sait pas se conduire she ought to have come to ask about me  yes since youre under her care i laughed  as for her not knowing how to behavewell thats exactly what we shall see  you will but not i  i wash my hands of her  dont say thatdont say that  mrs nettlepoint looked at me a moment  why do you speak so solemnly  in return i considered her  ill tell you before we land  and have you seen much of your son  oh yes he has come in several times  he seems very much pleased  he has got a cabin to himself  thats great luck i said but ive an idea hes always in luck  i was sure i should have to offer him the second berth in my room  and you wouldnt have enjoyed that because you dont like him she took upon herself to say  what put that into your head  it isnt in my headits in my heart my coeur de mere  we guess those things  you think hes selfish  i could see it last night  dear lady i contrived promptly enough to reply ive no general ideas about him at all  hes just one of the phenomena i am going to observe he seems to me a very fine young man  however i added since youve mentioned last night ill admit that i thought he rather tantalised you he played with your suspense  why he came at the last just to please me said mrs nettlepoint  i was silent a little  are you sure it was for your sake  ah perhaps it was for yours  i bore up however against this thrust characteristic of perfidious woman when you presume to side with her against a fond tormentor  when he went out on the balcony with that girl i found assurance to suggest perhaps she asked him to come for hers  perhaps she did  but why should he do everything she asks himsuch as she is  i dont know yet but perhaps i shall know later  not that hell tell mefor hell never tell me anything hes not i consistently opined one of those who tell  if she didnt ask him what you say is a great wrong to her said mrs nettlepoint  yes if she didnt  but you say that to protect jaspernot to protect her i smiled  you are coldbloodedits uncanny my friend exclaimed  ah this is nothing yet  wait a whileyoull see  at sea in general im awfuli exceed the limits  if ive outraged her in thought ill jump overboard  there are ways of askinga man doesnt need to tell a woman thatwithout the crude words  i dont know what you imagine between them said mrs nettlepoint  well nothing i allowed but what was visible on the surface  it transpired as the newspapers say that they were old friends  he met her at some promiscuous partyi asked him about it afterwards shes not a personmy hostess was confidentwhom he could ever think of seriously  thats exactly what i believe  you dont observeyou knowyou imagine mrs nettlepoint continued to argue  how do you reconcile her laying a trap for jasper with her going out to liverpool on an errand of love  oh i wasnt to be caught that way  i dont for an instant suppose she laid a trap i believe she acted on the impulse of the moment  shes going out to liverpool on an errand of marriage thats not necessarily the same thing as an errand of love especially for one who happens to have had a personal impression of the gentleman shes engaged to  well there are certain decencies which in such a situation the most abandoned of her sex would still observe  you apparently judge her capableon no evidenceof violating them  ah you dont understand the shades of things i returned  decencies and violations dear ladytheres no need for such heavy artillery  i can perfectly imagine that without the least immodesty she should have said to jasper on the balcony in fact if not in words im in dreadful spirits but if you come i shall feel better and that will be pleasant for you too  and why is she in dreadful spirits  she isnt i replied laughing  my poor friend wondered  what then is she doing  shes walking with your son  mrs nettlepoint for a moment said nothing then she treated me to another inconsequence  ah shes horrid  no shes charming i protested  you mean shes curious  well for me its the same thing  this led my friend of course to declare once more that i was coldblooded  on the afternoon of the morrow we had another talk and she told me that in the morning miss mavis had paid her a long visit  she knew nothing poor creature about anything but her intentions were good and she was evidently in her own eyes conscientious and decorous  and mrs nettlepoint concluded these remarks with the sigh unfortunate person  you think shes a good deal to be pitied then  well her story sounds drearyshe told me a good deal of it  she fell to talking little by little and went from one thing to another  shes in that situation when a girl must open herselfto some woman  hasnt she got jasper i asked  he isnt a woman  you strike me as jealous of him my companion added  i daresay he thinks soor will before the end  ah noah no  and i asked mrs nettlepoint if our young lady struck her as very grossly a flirt  she gave me no answer but went on to remark that she found it odd and interesting to see the way a girl like grace mavis resembled the girls of the kind she herself knew better the girls of society at the same time that she differed from them and the way the differences and resemblances were so mixed up that on certain questions you couldnt tell where youd find her  youd think shed feel as you did because you had found her feeling so and then suddenly in regard to some other matterwhich was yet quite the sameshed be utterly wanting  mrs nettlepoint proceeded to observeto such idle speculations does the vacancy of seahours give encouragementthat she wondered whether it were better to be an ordinary girl very well brought up or an extraordinary girl not brought up at all  oh i go in for the extraordinary girl under all circumstances  its true that if youre very well brought up youre not you cant be ordinary said mrs nettlepoint smelling her strong salts  youre a lady at any rate  and miss mavis is fifty miles outis that what you mean  wellyouve seen her mother  yes but i think your contention would be that among such people the mother doesnt count  precisely and thats bad  i see what you mean  but isnt it rather hard  if your mother doesnt know anything its better you should be independent of her and yet if you are that constitutes a bad note  i added that mrs mavis had appeared to count sufficiently two nights before  she had said and done everything she wanted while the girl sat silent and respectful  graces attitude so far as her parent was concerned had been eminently decent  yes but she squirmed for her said mrs nettlepoint  ah if you know it i may confess she has told me as much  my friend stared  told you  theres one of the things they do  well it was only a word  wont you let me know whether you do think her a flirt  try her yourselfthats better than asking another woman especially as you pretend to study folk  oh your judgement wouldnt probably at all determine mine  its as bearing on you i ask it  which however demanded explanation so that i was duly frank confessing myself curious as to how far maternal immorality would go  it made her at first but repeat my words  maternal immorality  you desire your son to have every possible distraction on his voyage and if you can make up your mind in the sense i refer to that will make it all right  hell have no responsibility  heavens how you analyse she cried  i havent in the least your passion for making up my mind  then if you chance it i returned youll be more immoral still  your reasonings strange said mrs nettlepoint when it was you who tried to put into my head yesterday that she had asked him to come  yes but in good faith  what do you mean in such a case by that  why as girls of that sort do  their allowance and measure in such matters i expounded is much larger than that of young persons who have been as you say very well brought up and yet im not sure that on the whole i dont think them thereby the more innocent  miss mavis is engaged and shes to be married next week but its an old old story and theres no more romance in it than if she were going to be photographed  so her usual life proceeds and her usual life consistsand that of ces demoiselles in generalin having plenty of gentlemens society  having it i mean without having any harm from it  mrs nettlepoint had given me due attention  well if theres no harm from it what are you talking about and why am i immoral  i hesitated laughing  i retractyoure sane and clear  im sure she thinks there wont be any harm i added  thats the great point  the great point  to be settled i mean  mercy were not trying them cried my friend  how can we settle it  i mean of course in our minds  there will be nothing more interesting these next ten days for our minds to exercise themselves upon  then theyll get terribly tired of it said mrs nettlepoint  no nobecause the interest will increase and the plot will thicken  it simply cant not i insisted  she looked at me as if she thought me more than mephistophelean and i went back to something she had lately mentioned  so she told you everything in her life was dreary  not everything but most things  and she didnt tell me so much as i guessed it  shell tell me more the next time  shell behave properly now about coming in to see me i told her she ought to  im glad of that i said  keep her with you as much as possible  i dont follow you closely mrs nettlepoint replied but so far as i do i dont think your remarks in the best taste  well im too excited i lose my head in these sports i had to recognisecoldblooded as you think me  doesnt she like mr porterfield  yes thats the worst of it  i kept making her stare  the worst of it  hes so goodtheres no fault to be found with him  otherwise shed have thrown it all up  it has dragged on since she was eighteen she became engaged to him before he went abroad to study  it was one of those very young and perfectly needless blunders that parents in america might make so much less possible than they do  the thing is to insist on ones daughter waiting on the engagements being long and then after youve got that started to take it on every occasion as little seriously as possibleto make it die out  you can easily tire it to death mrs nettlepoint competently stated  however she concluded mr porterfield has taken this one seriously for some years  he has done his part to keep it alive  she says he adores her  his part  surely his part would have been to marry her by this time  he has really no money  my friend was even more confidently able to report it than i had been  he ought to have got some in seven years i audibly reflected  so i think she thinks  there are some sorts of helplessness that are contemptible  however a small difference has taken place  thats why he wont wait any longer  his mother has come out she has somethinga littleand shes able to assist him  shell live with them and bear some of the expenses and after her death the son will have what there is  how old is she i cynically asked  i havent the least idea  but it doesnt on his part sound very heroicor very inspiring for our friend here  he hasnt been to america since he first went out  thats an odd way of adoring her i observed  i made that objection mentally but i didnt express it to her  she met it indeed a little by telling me that he had had other chances to marry  that surprises me i remarked  but did she say i asked that she had had  no and thats one of the things i thought nice in her for she must have had  she didnt try to make out that he had spoiled her life  she has three other sisters and theres very little money at home  she has tried to make money she has written little things and painted little thingsand dreadful little things they must have been too bad to think of  her father has had a long illness and has lost his placehe was in receipt of a salary in connexion with some waterworksand one of her sisters has lately become a widow with children and without means  and so as in fact she never has married any one else whatever opportunities she may have encountered she appears to have just made up her mind to go out to mr porterfield as the least of her evils  but it isnt very amusing  well i judged after all that only makes her doing it the more honourable  shell go through with it whatever it costs rather than disappoint him after he has waited so long  its true i continued that when a woman acts from a sense of honour  well when she does said mrs nettlepoint for i hung back perceptibly  its often so extravagant and unnatural a proceeding as to entail heavy costs on some one  youre very impertinent  we all have to pay for each other all the while and for each others virtues as well as vices  thats precisely why i shall be sorry for mr porterfield when she steps off the ship with her little bill  i mean with her teeth clenched  her teeth are not in the least clenched  shes quite at her ease nowmrs nettlepoint could answer for that  well we must try and keep her so i said  you must take care that jasper neglects nothing  i scarce know what reflexions this innocent pleasantry of mine provoked on the good ladys part the upshot of them at all events was to make her say well i never asked her to come im very glad of that  its all their own doing  their ownyou mean jaspers and hers  no indeed  i mean her mothers and mrs allens the girls too of course  they put themselves on us by main force  oh yes i can testify to that  therefore im glad too  we should have missed it i think  how seriously you take it mrs nettlepoint amusedly cried  ah wait a few daysand i got up to leave her     chapter iii   the patagonia was slow but spacious and comfortable and there was a motherly decency in her long nursing rock and her rustling oldfashioned gait the multitudinous swish in her wake as of a thousand proper petticoats  it was as if she wished not to present herself in port with the splashed eagerness of a young creature  we werent numerous enough quite to elbow each other and yet werent too few to supportwith that familiarity and relief which figures and objects acquire on the great bare field of the ocean and under the great bright glass of the sky  i had never liked the sea so much before indeed i had never liked it at all but now i had a revelation of how in a midsummer mood it could please  it was darkly and magnificently blue and imperturbably quietsave for the great regular swell of its heartbeats the pulse of its life and there grew to be something so agreeable in the sense of floating there in infinite isolation and leisure that it was a positive godsend the patagonia was no racer  one had never thought of the sea as the great place of safety but now it came over one that theres no place so safe from the land  when it doesnt confer trouble it takes trouble awaytakes away letters and telegrams and newspapers and visits and duties and efforts all the complications all the superfluities and superstitions that we have stuffed into our terrene life  the simple absence of the post when the particular conditions enable you to enjoy the great fact by which its produced becomes in itself a positive bliss and the clean boards of the deck turn to the stage of a play that amuses the personal drama of the voyage the movement and interaction in the strong sealight of figures that end by representing somethingsomething moreover of which the interest is never even in its keenness too great to suffer you to slumber  i at any rate dozed to excess stretched on my rug with a french novel and when i opened my eyes i generally saw jasper nettlepoint pass with the young woman confided to his mothers care on his arm  somehow at these moments between sleeping and waking i inconsequently felt that my french novel had set them in motion  perhaps this was because i had fallen into the trick at the start of regarding grace mavis almost as a married woman which as every one knows is the necessary status of the heroine of such a work  every revolution of our engine at any rate would contribute to the effect of making her one  in the saloon at meals my neighbour on the right was a certain little mrs peck a very short and very round person whose head was enveloped in a cloud a cloud of dirty white wool and who promptly let me know that she was going to europe for the education of her children  i had already perceivedan hour after we left the dockthat some energetic measure was required in their interest but as we were not in europe yet the redemption of the four little pecks was stayed  enjoying untrammelled leisure they swarmed about the ship as if they had been pirates boarding her and their mother was as powerless to check their licence as if she had been gagged and stowed away in the hold  they were especially to be trusted to dive between the legs of the stewards when these attendants arrived with bowls of soup for the languid ladies  their mother was too busy counting over to her fellowpassengers all the years miss mavis had been engaged  in the blank of our common detachment things that were nobodys business very soon became everybodys and this was just one of those facts that are propagated with mysterious and ridiculous speed  the whisper that carries them is very small in the great scale of things of air and space and progress but its also very safe for theres no compression no soundingboard to make speakers responsible  and then repetition at sea is somehow not repetition monotony is in the air the mind is flat and everything recursthe bells the meals the stewards faces the romp of children the walk the clothes the very shoes and buttons of passengers taking their exercise  these things finally grow at once so circumstantial and so arid that in comparison lights on the personal history of ones companions become a substitute for the friendly flicker of the lost fireside  jasper nettlepoint sat on my left hand when he was not upstairs seeing that miss mavis had her repast comfortably on deck  his mothers place would have been next mine had she shown herself and then that of the young lady under her care  these companions in other words would have been between us jasper marking the limit of the party in that quarter miss mavis was present at luncheon the first day but dinner passed without her coming in and when it was half over jasper remarked that he would go up and look after her  isnt that young lady comingthe one who was here to lunch mrs peck asked of me as he left the saloon  apparently not  my friend tells me she doesnt like the saloon  you dont mean to say shes sick do you  oh no not in this weather  but she likes to be above  and is that gentleman gone up to her  yes shes under his mothers care  and is his mother up there too asked mrs peck whose processes were homely and direct  no she remains in her cabin  people have different tastes  perhaps thats one reason why miss mavis doesnt come to table i addedher chaperon not being able to accompany her  her chaperon my fellow passenger echoed  mrs nettlepointthe lady under whose protection she happens to be  protection mrs peck stared at me a moment moving some valued morsel in her mouth then she exclaimed familiarly pshaw  i was struck with this and was on the point of asking her what she meant by it when she continued aint we going to see mrs nettlepoint  im afraid not  she vows she wont stir from her sofa  pshaw said mrs peck again  thats quite a disappointment  do you know her then  no but i know all about her  then my companion added you dont mean to say shes any real relation  do you mean to me  no to grace mavis  none at all  theyre very new friends as i happen to know  then youre acquainted with our young lady  i hadnt noticed the passage of any recognition between them at luncheon  is she your young lady too asked mrs peck with high significance  ah when people are in the same boatliterallythey belong a little to each other  thats so said mrs peck  i dont know miss mavis but i know all about heri live opposite to her on merrimac avenue  i dont know whether you know that part  oh yesits very beautiful  the consequence of this remark was another pshaw  but mrs peck went on when youve lived opposite to people like that for a long time you feel as if you had some rights in themtit for tat  but she didnt take it up today she didnt speak to me  she knows who i am as well as she knows her own mother  you had better speak to her firstshes constitutionally shy i remarked  shy  shes constitutionally tough  why shes thirty years old cried my neighbour  i suppose you know where shes going  oh yeswe all take an interest in that  that young man i suppose particularly  and then as i feigned a vagueness the handsome one who sits there  didnt you tell me hes mrs nettlepoints son  oh yeshe acts as her deputy  no doubt he does all he can to carry out her function  mrs peck briefly brooded  i had spoken jocosely but she took it with a serious face  well she might let him eat his dinner in peace she presently put forth  oh hell come back i said glancing at his place  the repast continued and when it was finished i screwed my chair round to leave the table  mrs peck performed the same movement and we quitted the saloon together  outside of it was the usual vestibule with several seats from which you could descend to the lower cabins or mount to the promenadedeck  mrs peck appeared to hesitate as to her course and then solved the problem by going neither way  she dropped on one of the benches and looked up at me  i thought you said hed come back  young nettlepoint  yes i see he didnt  miss mavis then has given him half her dinner  its very kind of her  she has been engaged half her life  yes but that will soon be over  so i supposeas quick as ever we land  every one knows it on merrimac avenue mrs peck pursued  every one there takes a great interest in it  ah of coursea girl like that has many friends  but my informant discriminated  i mean even people who dont know her  i see i went on shes so handsome that she attracts attentionpeople enter into her affairs  mrs peck spoke as from the commanding centre of these  she used to be pretty but i cant say i think shes anything remarkable today anyhow if she attracts attention she ought to be all the more careful what she does  you had better tell her that  oh its none of my business i easily made out leaving the terrible little woman and going above  this profession i grant was not perfectly attuned to my real idea or rather my real idea was not quite in harmony with my profession  the very first thing i did on reaching the deck was to notice that miss mavis was pacing it on jasper nettlepoints arm and that whatever beauty she might have lost according to mrs pecks insinuation she still kept enough to make ones eyes follow her  she had put on a crimson hood which was very becoming to her and which she wore for the rest of the voyage  she walked very well with long steps and i remember that at this moment the sea had a gentle evening swell which made the great ship dip slowly rhythmically giving a movement that was graceful to graceful pedestrians and a more awkward one to the awkward  it was the loveliest hour of a fine day the clear early evening with the glow of the sunset in the air and a purple colour on the deep  it was always present to me that so the waters ploughed by the homeric heroes must have looked  i became conscious on this particular occasion moreover that grace mavis would for the rest of the voyage be the most visible thing in ones range the figure that would count most in the composition of groups  she couldnt help it poor girl nature had made her conspicuousimportant as the painters say she paid for it by the corresponding exposure the danger that people would as i had said to mrs peck enter into her affairs  jasper nettlepoint went down at certain times to see his mother and i watched for one of these occasionson the third day outand took advantage of it to go and sit by miss mavis  she wore a light blue veil drawn tightly over her face so that if the smile with which she greeted me rather lacked intensity i could account for it partly by that  well were getting onwere getting on i said cheerfully looking at the friendly twinkling sea  are we going very fast  not fast but steadily  ohne hast ohne rastdo you know german  well ive studied itsome  it will be useful to you over there when you travel  well yes if we do  but i dont suppose we shall much  mr nettlepoint says we ought my young woman added in a moment  ah of course he thinks so  he has been all over the world  yes he has described some of the places  they must be wonderful  i didnt know i should like it so much  but it isnt europe yet i laughed  well she didnt care if it wasnt  i mean going on this way  i could go on for everfor ever and ever  ah you know its not always like this i hastened to mention  well its better than boston  it isnt so good as paris i still more portentously noted  oh i know all about paris  theres no freshness in that  i feel as if i had been there all the time  you mean youve heard so much of it  oh yes nothing else for ten years  i had come to talk with miss mavis because she was attractive but i had been rather conscious of the absence of a good topic not feeling at liberty to revert to mr porterfield  she hadnt encouraged me when i spoke to her as we were leaving boston to go on with the history of my acquaintance with this gentleman and yet now unexpectedly she appeared to implyit was doubtless one of the disparities mentioned by mrs nettlepointthat he might be glanced at without indelicacy  i seeyou mean by letters i remarked  we wont live in a good part  i know enough to know that she went on  well it isnt as if there were any very bad ones i answered reassuringly  why mr nettlepoint says its regular mean  and to what does he apply that expression  she eyed me a moment as if i were elegant at her expense but she answered my question  up there in the batignolles  i seem to make out its worse than merrimac avenue  worsein what way  why even less where the nice people live  he oughtnt to say that i returned  and i ventured to back it up dont you call mr porterfield a nice person  oh it doesnt make any difference  she watched me again a moment through her veil the texture of which gave her look a suffused prettiness  do you know him very little she asked  mr porterfield  no mr nettlepoint  ah very little  hes very considerably my junior you see  she had a fresh pause as if almost again for my elegance but she went on hes younger than me too  i dont know what effect of the comic there could have been in it but the turn was unexpected and it made me laugh  neither do i know whether miss mavis took offence at my sensibility on this head though i remember thinking at the moment with compunction that it had brought a flush to her cheek  at all events she got up gathering her shawl and her books into her arm  im going downim tired  tired of me im afraid  no not yet  im like you i confessed  i should like it to go on and on  she had begun to walk along the deck to the companionway and i went with her  well i guess i wouldnt after all  i had taken her shawl from her to carry it but at the top of the steps that led down to the cabins i had to give it back  your mother would be glad if she could know i observed as we parted  but she was proof against my graces  if she could know what  how well youre getting on  i refused to be discouraged  and that good mrs allen  oh mother mother  she made me come she pushed me off  and almost as if not to say more she went quickly below  i paid mrs nettlepoint a morning visit after luncheon and another in the evening before she turned in  that same day in the evening she said to me suddenly do you know what ive done  ive asked jasper  asked him what  why if she asked him you understand  i wondered  do i understand  if you dont its because you regular wont as she says  if that girl really asked himon the balconyto sail with us  my dear lady do you suppose that if she did hed tell you  she had to recognise my acuteness  thats just what he says  but he says she didnt  and do you consider the statement valuable i asked laughing out  you had better ask your young friend herself  mrs nettlepoint stared  i couldnt do that  on which i was the more amused that i had to explain i was only amused what does it signify now  i thought you thought everything signified  you were so full she cried of signification  yes but were further out now and somehow in midocean everything becomes absolute  what else can he do with decency mrs nettlepoint went on  if as my son he were never to speak to her it would be very rude and youd think that stranger still  then you would do what he does and where would be the difference  how do you know what he does  i havent mentioned him for twentyfour hours  why she told me herself  she came in this afternoon  what an odd thing to tell you i commented  not as she says it  she says hes full of attention perfectly devotedlooks after her all the time  she seems to want me to know it so that i may approve him for it  thats charming it shows her good conscience  yes or her great cleverness  something in the tone in which mrs nettlepoint said this caused me to return in real surprise why what do you suppose she has in her mind  to get hold of him to make him go so far he cant retreat  to marry him perhaps  to marry him  and what will she do with mr porterfield  shell ask me just to make it all right to himor perhaps you  yes as an old friendand for a moment i felt it awkwardly possible but i put to her seriously do you see jasper caught like that  well hes only a boyhes younger at least than she  precisely she regards him as a child  she remarked to me herself today that is that hes so much younger  mrs nettlepoint took this in does she talk of it with you  that shows she has a plan that she has thought it over  ive sufficiently expressedfor the interest of my anecdotethat i found an oddity in one of our young companions but i was far from judging her capable of laying a trap for the other  moreover my reading of jasper wasnt in the least that he was catchablecould be made to do a thing if he didnt want to do it  of course it wasnt impossible that he might be inclined that he might take itor already have taken itinto his head to go further with his mothers charge but to believe this i should require still more proof than his always being with her  he wanted at most to take up with her for the voyage if youve questioned him perhaps youve tried to make him feel responsible i said to my fellow critic  a little but its very difficult  interference makes him perverse  one has to go gently  besides its too absurdthink of her age  if she cant take care of herself cried mrs nettlepoint  yes let us keep thinking of her age though its not so prodigious  and if things get very bad youve one resource left i added  she wondered  to lock her up in her cabin  noto come out of yours  ah never never  if it takes that to save her she must be lost besides what good would it do  if i were to go above she could come below  yes but you could keep jasper with you  could i mrs nettlepoint demanded in the manner of a woman who knew her son  in the saloon the next day after dinner over the red cloth of the tables beneath the swinging lamps and the racks of tumblers decanters and wineglasses we sat down to whist mrs peck to oblige taking a hand in the game  she played very badly and talked too much and when the rubber was over assuaged her discomfiture though not minewe had been partners with a welsh rabbit and a tumbler of something hot  we had done with the cards but while she waited for this refreshment she sat with her elbows on the table shuffling a pack  she hasnt spoken to me yetshe wont do it she remarked in a moment  is it possible theres any one on the ship who hasnt spoken to you  not that girlshe knows too well mrs peck looked round our little circle with a smile of intelligenceshe had familiar communicative eyes several of our company had assembled according to the wont the last thing in the evening of those who are cheerful at sea for the consumption of grilled sardines and devilled bones  what then does she know  oh she knows i know  well we know what mrs peck knows one of the ladies of the group observed to me with an air of privilege  well you wouldnt know if i hadnt told youfrom the way she acts said our friend with a laugh of small charm  shes going out to a gentleman who lives over therehes waiting there to marry her the other lady went on in the tone of authentic information  i remember that her name was mrs gotch and that her mouth looked always as if she were whistling  oh he knowsive told him said mrs peck  well i presume every one knows mrs gotch contributed  dear madam is it every ones business i asked  why dont you think its a peculiar way to actand mrs gotch was evidently surprised at my little protest  why its right therestraight in front of you like a play at the theatreas if you had paid to see it said mrs peck  if you dont call it public  arent you mixing things up  what do you call public  why the way they go on  theyre up there now  they cuddle up there half the night said mrs gotch  i dont know when they come down  any hour they like  when all the lights are out theyre up there still  oh you cant tire them out  they dont want relieflike the ships watch laughed one of the gentlemen  well if they enjoy each others society whats the harm another asked  theyd do just the same on land  they wouldnt do it on the public streets i presume said mrs peck and they wouldnt do it if mr porterfield was round  isnt that just where your confusion comes in i made answer  its public enough that miss mavis and mr nettlepoint are always together but it isnt in the least public that shes going to be married  why how can you saywhen the very sailors know it  the captain knows it and all the officers know it  they see them there especially at night when theyre sailing the ship  i thought there was some rule submitted mrs gotch  well there isthat youve got to behave yourself mrs peck explained  so the captain told mehe said they have some rule  he said they have to have when people are too undignified  is that the term he used i inquired  well he may have said when they attract too much attention  i ventured to discriminate  its we who attract the attentionby talking about what doesnt concern us and about what we really dont know  she said the captain said hed tell on her as soon as ever we arrive mrs gotch none the less serenely pursued  she said i repeated bewildered  well he did say so that hed think it his duty to inform mr porterfield when he comes on to meet herif they keep it up in the same way said mrs peck  oh theyll keep it up dont you fear one of the gentlemen exclaimed  dear madam the captains having his joke on you was however my own congruous reply  no he ainthes right down scandalised  he says he regards us all as a real family and wants the family not to be downright coarse  i felt mrs peck irritated by my controversial tone she challenged me with considerable spirit  how can you say i dont know it when all the street knows it and has known it for yearsfor years and years  she spoke as if the girl had been engaged at least for twenty  whats she going out for if not to marry him  perhaps shes going to see how he looks suggested one of the gentlemen  hed look queerif he knew  well i guess hell know said mrs gotch  shed tell him herselfshe wouldnt be afraid the gentleman went on  well she might as well kill him  hell jump overboard mrs peck could foretell  jump overboard cried mrs gotch as if she hoped then that mr porterfield would be told  he has just been waiting for thisfor long long years said mrs peck  do you happen to know him i asked  she replied at her convenience  no but i know a lady who does  are you going up  i had risen from my placei had not ordered supper  im going to take a turn before going to bed  well then youll see  outside the saloon i hesitated for mrs pecks admonition made me feel for a moment that if i went up i should have entered in a manner into her little conspiracy  but the night was so warm and splendid that i had been intending to smoke a cigar in the air before going below and i didnt see why i should deprive myself of this pleasure in order to seem not to mind mrs peck  i mounted accordingly and saw a few figures sitting or moving about in the darkness  the ocean looked black and small as it is apt to do at night and the long mass of the ship with its vague dim wings seemed to take up a great part of it  there were more stars than one saw on land and the heavens struck one more than ever as larger than the earth  grace mavis and her companion were not so far as i perceived at first among the few passengers who lingered late and i was glad because i hated to hear her talked about in the manner of the gossips i had left at supper  i wished there had been some way to prevent it but i could think of none but to recommend her privately to reconsider her rule of discretion  that would be a very delicate business and perhaps it would be better to begin with jasper though that would be delicate too  at any rate one might let him know in a friendly spirit to how much remark he exposed the young ladyleaving this revelation to work its way upon him  unfortunately i couldnt altogether believe that the pair were unconscious of the observation and the opinion of the passengers  they werent boy and girl they had a certain social perspective in their eye  i was meanwhile at any rate in no possession of the details of that behaviour which had made themaccording to the version of my good friends in the saloona scandal to the ship for though i had taken due note of them as will already have been gathered i had taken really no such ferocious or at least such competent note as mrs peck  nevertheless the probability was that they knew what was thought of themwhat naturally would beand simply didnt care  that made our heroine out rather perverse and even rather shameless and yet somehow if these were her leanings i didnt dislike her for them  i dont know what strange secret excuses i found for her  i presently indeed encountered on the spot a need for any i might have at call since just as i was on the point of going below again after several restless turns andwithin the limit where smoking was allowedas many puffs at a cigar as i cared for i became aware of a couple of figures settled together behind one of the lifeboats that rested on the deck  they were so placed as to be visible only to a person going close to the rail and peering a little sidewise  i dont think i peered but as i stood a moment beside the rail my eye was attracted by a dusky object that protruded beyond the boat and that i saw at a second glance to be the tail of a ladys dress  i bent forward an instant but even then i saw very little more that scarcely mattered however as i easily concluded that the persons tucked away in so snug a corner were jasper nettlepoint and mr porterfields intended  tucked away was the odious right expression and i deplored the fact so betrayed for the pitiful bad taste in it  i immediately turned away and the next moment found myself face to face with our vessels skipper  i had already had some conversation with himhe had been so good as to invite me as he had invited mrs nettlepoint and her son and the young lady travelling with them and also mrs peck to sit at his tableand had observed with pleasure that his seamanship had the grace not universal on the atlantic liners of a fineweather manner  they dont waste much timeyour friends in there he said nodding in the direction in which he had seen me looking  ah well they havent much to lose  thats what i mean  im told she hasnt  i wanted to say something exculpatory but scarcely knew what note to strike  i could only look vaguely about me at the starry darkness and the sea that seemed to sleep  well with these splendid nights and this perfect air people are beguiled into late hours  yes we want a bit of a blow the captain said  i demurred  how much of one  enough to clear the decks  he was after all rather dry and he went about his business  he had made me uneasy and instead of going below i took a few turns more  the other walkers dropped off pair by pairthey were all mentill at last i was alone  then after a little i quitted the field  jasper and his companion were still behind their lifeboat  personally i greatly preferred our actual conditions but as i went down i found myself vaguely wishing in the interest of i scarcely knew what unless it had been a mere superstitious delicacy that we might have half a gale  miss mavis turned out in seaphrase early for the next morning i saw her come up only a short time after i had finished my breakfast a ceremony over which i contrived not to dawdle  she was alone and jasper nettlepoint by a rare accident was not on deck to help her  i went to meet hershe was encumbered as usual with her shawl her sunumbrella and a bookand laid my hands on her chair placing it near the stern of the ship where she liked best to be  but i proposed to her to walk a little before she sat down and she took my arm after i had put her accessories into the chair  the deck was clear at that hour and the morning light gay one had an extravagant sense of good omens and propitious airs  i forget what we spoke of first but it was because i felt these things pleasantly and not to torment my companion nor to test her that i couldnt help exclaiming cheerfully after a moment as i have mentioned having done the first day well were getting on were getting on  oh yes i count every hour  the last days always go quicker i said and the last hours  well the last hours she asked for i had instinctively checked myself  oh ones so glad then that its almost the same as if one had arrived yet we ought to be grateful when the elements have been so kind to us i added  i hope youll have enjoyed the voyage  she hesitated ever so little  yes much more than i expected  did you think it would be very bad  horrible horrible  the tone of these words was strange but i hadnt much time to reflect upon it for turning round at that moment i saw jasper nettlepoint come toward us  he was still distant by the expanse of the white deck and i couldnt help taking him in from head to foot as he drew nearer  i dont know what rendered me on this occasion particularly sensitive to the impression but it struck me that i saw him as i had never seen him before saw him thanks to the intense sealight inside and out in his personal his moral totality  it was a quick a vivid revelation if it only lasted a moment it had a simplifying certifying effect  he was intrinsically a pleasing apparition with his handsome young face and that marked absence of any drop in his personal arrangements which more than any one ive ever seen he managed to exhibit on shipboard  he had none of the appearance of wearing out old clothes that usually prevails there but dressed quite straight as i heard some one say  this gave him an assured almost a triumphant air as of a young man who would come best out of any awkwardness  i expected to feel my companions hand loosen itself on my arm as an indication that now she must go to him and i was almost surprised she didnt drop me  we stopped as we met and jasper bade us a friendly goodmorning  of course the remark that we had another lovely day was already indicated and it led him to exclaim in the manner of one to whom criticism came easily yes but with this sort of thing consider what one of the others would do  one of the other ships  we should be there now or at any rate tomorrow  well then im glad it isnt one of the othersand i smiled at the young lady on my arm  my words offered her a chance to say something appreciative and gave him one even more but neither jasper nor grace mavis took advantage of the occasion  what they did do i noticed was to look at each other rather fixedly an instant after which she turned her eyes silently to the sea  she made no movement and uttered no sound contriving to give me the sense that she had all at once become perfectly passive that she somehow declined responsibility  we remained standing there with jasper in front of us and if the contact of her arm didnt suggest i should give her up neither did it intimate that we had better pass on  i had no idea of giving her up albeit one of the things i seemed to read just then into jaspers countenance was a fine implication that she was his property  his eyes met mine for a moment and it was exactly as if he had said to me i know what you think but i dont care a rap what i really thought was that he was selfish beyond the limits that was the substance of my little revelation  youth is almost always selfish just as it is almost always conceited and after all when its combined with health and good parts good looks and good spirits it has a right to be and i easily forgive it if it be really youth  still its a question of degree and what stuck out of jasper nettlepointif of course one had the intelligence for itwas that his egotism had a hardness his love of his own way an avidity  these elements were jaunty and prosperous they were accustomed to prevail  he was fond very fond of women they were necessary to himthat was in his type but he wasnt in the least in love with grace mavis  among the reflexions i quickly made this was the one that was most to the point  there was a degree of awkwardness after a minute in the way we were planted there though the apprehension of it was doubtless not in the least with himself  to dissimulate my own share in it at any rate i asked him how his mother might be  his answer was unexpected  you had better go down and see  not till miss mavis is tired of me  she said nothing to this and i made her walk again  for some minutes she failed to speak then rather abruptly she began ive seen you talking to that lady who sits at our tablethe one who has so many children  mrs peck  oh yes one has inevitably talked with mrs peck  do you know her very well  only as one knows people at sea  an acquaintance makes itself  it doesnt mean very much  she doesnt speak to meshe might if she wanted  thats just what she says of youthat you might speak to her  oh if shes waiting for that said my companion with a laugh  then she added she lives in our street nearly opposite  precisely  thats the reason why she thinks you coy or haughty  she has seen you so often and seems to know so much about you  what does she know about me  ah you must ask heri cant tell you  i dont care what she knows said my young lady  after a moment she went on she must have seen i aint very sociable  and then what are you laughing at she asked  wellmy amusement was difficult to explainyoure not very sociable and yet somehow you are  mrs peck is at any rate and thought that ought to make it easy for you to enter into conversation with her  oh i dont care for her conversationi know what it amounts to  i made no replyi scarcely knew what reply to makeand the girl went on i know what she thinks and i know what she says  still i was silent but the next moment i saw my discretion had been wasted for miss mavis put to me straight does she make out that she knows mr porterfield  no she only claims she knows a lady who knows him  yes thats itmrs jeremie  mrs jeremies an idiot  i wasnt in a position to controvert this and presently my young lady said she would sit down  i left her in her chairi saw that she preferred itand wandered to a distance  a few minutes later i met jasper again and he stopped of his own accord to say we shall be in about six in the evening of our eleventh daythey promise it  if nothing happens of course  well whats going to happen  thats just what im wondering  and i turned away and went below with the foolish but innocent satisfaction of thinking i had mystified him     chapter iv   i dont know what to do and you must help me mrs nettlepoint said to me that evening as soon as i looked in  ill do what i canbut whats the matter  she has been crying here and going onshe has quite upset me  crying  she doesnt look like that  exactly and thats what startled me  she came in to see me this afternoon as she has done before and we talked of the weather and the run of the ship and the manners of the stewardess and other such trifles and then suddenly in the midst of it as she sat there on no visible pretext she burst into tears  i asked her what ailed her and tried to comfort her but she didnt explain she said it was nothing the effect of the sea of the monotony of the excitement of leaving home  i asked her if it had anything to do with her prospects with her marriage whether she finds as this draws near that her heart isnt in it  i told her she mustnt be nervous that i could enter into thatin short i said what i could  all she replied was that she is nervous very nervous but that it was already over and then she jumped up and kissed me and went away  does she look as if she has been crying mrs nettlepoint wound up  how can i tell when she never quits that horrid veil  its as if she were ashamed to show her face  shes keeping it for liverpool  but i dont like such incidents said mrs nettlepoint  i think i ought to go above  and is that where you want me to help you  oh with your arm and that sort of thing yes  but i may have to look to you for something more  i feel as if something were going to happen  thats exactly what i said to jasper this morning  and what did he say  he only looked innocentas if he thought i meant a fog or a storm  heaven forbidit isnt that  i shall never be goodnatured again mrs nettlepoint went on never have a girl put on me that way  you always pay for itthere are always tiresome complications  what im afraid of is after we get there  shell throw up her engagement there will be dreadful scenes i shall be mixed up with them and have to look after her and keep her with me  i shall have to stay there with her till she can be sent back or even take her up to london  do you see all that  i listened respectfully after which i observed youre afraid of your son  she also had a pause  it depends on how you mean it  there are things you might say to himand with your manner because you have one you know when you choose  very likely but whats my manner to his  besides i have said everything to him  that is ive said the great thingthat hes making her immensely talked about  and of course in answer to that he has asked you how you know and youve told him you have it from me  ive had to tell him and he says its none of your business  i wish hed say that i remarked to my face  hell do so perfectly if you give him a chance  thats where you can help me  quarrel with himhes rather good at a quarrel and that will divert him and draw him off  then im ready i returned to discuss the matter with him for the rest of the voyage  very well i count on you  but hell ask you as he asks me what the deuce you want him to do  to go to bedand im afraid i laughed  oh it isnt a joke  i didnt want to be irritating but i made my point  thats exactly what i told you at first  yes but dont exult i hate people who exult  jasper asks of me she went on why he should mind her being talked about if she doesnt mind it herself  ill tell him why i replied and mrs nettlepoint said she should be exceedingly obliged to me and repeated that she would indeed take the field  i looked for jasper above that same evening but circumstances didnt favour my quest  i found himthat is i gathered he was again ensconced behind the lifeboat with miss mavis but there was a needless violence in breaking into their communion and i put off our interview till the next day  then i took the first opportunity at breakfast to make sure of it  he was in the saloon when i went in and was preparing to leave the table but i stopped him and asked if he would give me a quarter of an hour on deck a little laterthere was something particular i wanted to say to him  he said oh yes if you likewith just a visible surprise but i thought with plenty of assurance  when i had finished my breakfast i found him smoking on the forwarddeck and i immediately began im going to say something you wont at all like to ask you a question youll probably denounce for impertinent  i certainly shall if i find it so said jasper nettlepoint  well of course my warning has meant that i dont care if you do  im a good deal older than you and im a friendof many yearsof your mother theres nothing i like less than to be meddlesome but i think these things give me a certain righta sort of privilege  besides which my inquiry will speak for itself  why so many damned preliminaries my young man asked through his smoke  we looked into each others eyes a moment  what indeed was his mothers mannerher best mannercompared with his  are you prepared to be responsible  to you  dear noto the young lady herself  im speaking of course of miss mavis  ah yes my mother tells me you have her greatly on your mind  so has your mother herselfnow  shes so good as to say soto oblige you  shed oblige me a great deal more by reassuring me  i know perfectly of your knowing ive told her that miss mavis is greatly talked about  yes but what on earth does it matter  it matters as a sign  a sign of what  that shes in a false position  jasper puffed his cigar with his eyes on the horizon and i had a little unexpectedly the sense of producing a certain effect on him  i dont know whether its your business what youre attempting to discuss but it really strikes me its none of mine  what have i to do with the tattle with which a pack of old women console themselves for not being seasick  do you call it tattle that miss mavis is in love with you  drivelling  then i retorted youre very ungrateful  the tattle of a pack of old women has this importance that she suspects or she knows it exists and that decent girls are for the most part very sensitive to that sort of thing  to be prepared not to heed it in this case she must have a reason and the reason must be the one ive taken the liberty to call your attention to  in love with me in six days just like thatand he still looked away through narrowed eyelids  theres no accounting for tastes and six days at sea are equivalent to sixty on land  i dont want to make you too proud  of course if you recognise your responsibility its all right and ive nothing to say  i dont see what you mean he presently returned  surely you ought to have thought of that by this time  shes engaged to be married and the gentleman shes engaged to is to meet her at liverpool  the whole ship knows itthough i didnt tell themand the whole ships watching her  its impertinent if you like just as i am myself but we make a little world here together and we cant blink its conditions  what i ask you is whether youre prepared to allow her to give up the gentleman ive just mentioned for your sake  jasper spoke in a moment as if he didnt understand  for my sake  to marry her if she breaks with him  he turned his eyes from the horizon to my own and i found a strange expression in them  has miss mavis commissioned you to go into that  not in the least  well then i dont quite see  it isnt as from another i make it  let it come from yourselfto yourself  lord you must think i lead myself a life he cried as in compassion for my simplicity  thats a question the young lady may put to me any moment it pleases her  let me then express the hope that she will  but what will you answer  my dear sir it seems to me that in spite of all the titles youve enumerated youve no reason to expect ill tell you  he turned away and i dedicated in perfect sincerity a deep sore sigh to the thought of our young woman  at this under the impression of it he faced me again and looking at me from head to foot demanded what is it you want me to do  i put it to your mother that you ought to go to bed  you had better do that yourself he replied  this time he walked off and i reflected rather dolefully that the only clear result of my undertaking would probably have been to make it vivid to him that she was in love with him  mrs nettlepoint came up as she had announced but the day was half over it was nearly three oclock she was accompanied by her son who established her on deck arranged her chair and her shawls saw she was protected from sun and wind and for an hour was very properly attentive  while this went on grace mavis was not visible nor did she reappear during the whole afternoon  i hadnt observed that she had as yet been absent from the deck for so long a period  jasper left his mother but came back at intervals to see how she got on and when she asked where miss mavis might be answered that he hadnt the least idea  i sat with my friend at her particular request she told me she knew that if i didnt mrs peck and mrs gotch would make their approach so that i must act as a watchdog  she was flurried and fatigued with her migration and i think that grace maviss choosing this occasion for retirement suggested to her a little that she had been made a fool of  she remarked that the girls not being there showed her for the barbarian she only could be and that she herself was really very good so to have put herself out her charge was a mere bore that was the end of it  i could see that my companions advent quickened the speculative activity of the other ladies they watched her from the opposite side of the deck keeping their eyes fixed on her very much as the man at the wheel kept his on the course of the ship  mrs peck plainly had designs and it was from this danger that mrs nettlepoint averted her face  its just as we said she remarked to me as we sat there  its like the buckets in the well  when i come up everything else goes down  no not at all everything elsesince jasper remains here  remains  i dont see him  he comes and goesits the same thing  he goes more than he comes  but nen parlons plus i havent gained anything  i dont admire the sea at allwhat is it but a magnified watertank  i shant come up again  ive an idea shell stay in her cabin now i said  she tells me she has one to herself  mrs nettlepoint replied that she might do as she liked and i repeated to her the little conversation i had had with jasper  she listened with interest but marry her  mercy she exclaimed  i like the fine freedom with which you give my son away  you wouldnt accept that  why in the world should i  then i dont understand your position  good heavens i have none  it isnt a position to be tired of the whole thing  you wouldnt accept it even in the case i put to himthat of her believing she had been encouraged to throw over poor porterfield  not evennot even  who can know what she believes  it brought me back to where we had started from  then you do exactly what i said you wouldyou show me a fine example of maternal immorality  maternal fiddlesticks  it was she who began it  then why did you come up today i asked  to keep you quiet  mrs nettlepoints dinner was served on deck but i went into the saloon jasper was there but not grace mavis as i had halfexpected  i sought to learn from him what had become of her if she were illhe must have thought i had an odious pertinacityand he replied that he knew nothing whatever about her  mrs peck talked to meor tried toof mrs nettlepoint expatiating on the great interest it had been to see her only it was a pity she didnt seem more sociable  to this i made answer that she was to be excused on the score of health  you dont mean to say shes sick on this pond  no shes unwell in another way  i guess i know the way mrs peck laughed  and then she added i suppose she came up to look after her pet  her pet i set my face  why miss mavis  weve talked enough about that  quite enough  i dont know what that has had to do with it  miss mavis so far as ive noticed hasnt been above today  oh it goes on all the same  it goes on  well its too late  too late  well youll see  therell be a row  this wasnt comforting but i didnt repeat it on deck  mrs nettlepoint returned early to her cabin professing herself infinitely spent  i didnt know what went on but grace mavis continued not to show  i looked in late for a goodnight to my friend and learned from her that the girl hadnt been to her  she had sent the stewardess to her room for news to see if she were ill and needed assistance and the stewardess had come back with mere mention of her not being there  i went above after this the night was not quite so fair and the deck almost empty  in a moment jasper nettlepoint and our young lady moved past me together  i hope youre better  i called after her and she tossed me over her shoulderoh yes i had a headache but the air now does me good  i went down againi was the only person there but they and i wanted not to seem to dog their stepsand returning to mrs nettlepoints room found her door was open to the little passage that she was still sitting up  shes all right i said  shes on the deck with jasper  the good lady looked up at me from her book  i didnt know you called that all right  well its better than something else  than what else  something i was a little afraid of  mrs nettlepoint continued to look at me she asked again what that might be  ill tell you when were ashore i said  the next day i waited on her at the usual hour of my morning visit and found her not a little distraught  the scenes have begun she said you know i told you i shouldnt get through without them  you made me nervous last nighti havent the least idea what you meant but you made me horribly nervous  she came in to see me an hour ago and i had the courage to say to her i dont know why i shouldnt tell you frankly that ive been scolding my son about you  of course she asked what i meant by that and i let her know  it seems to me he drags you about the ship too much for a girl in your position  he has the air of not remembering that you belong to some one else  theres a want of taste and even a want of respect in it  that brought on an outbreak she became very violent  do you mean indignant  yes indignant and above all flustered and excitedat my presuming to suppose her relations with my son not the very simplest in the world  i might scold him as much as i likedthat was between ourselves but she didnt see why i should mention such matters to herself  did i think she allowed him to treat her with disrespect  that idea wasnt much of a compliment to either of them  he had treated her better and been kinder to her than most other peoplethere were very few on the ship who hadnt been insulting  she should be glad enough when she got off it to her own people to some one whom nobody would have a right to speak of  what was there in her position that wasnt perfectly natural what was the idea of making a fuss about her position  did i mean that she took it too easilythat she didnt think as much as she ought about mr porterfield  didnt i believe she was attached to himdidnt i believe she was just counting the hours till she saw him  that would be the happiest moment of her life  it showed how little i knew her if i thought anything else  all that must have been rather finei should have liked to hear it i said after quite hanging on my friends lips  and what did you reply  oh i grovelled i assured her that i accused heras regards my sonof nothing worse than an excess of good nature  she helped him to pass his timehe ought to be immensely obliged  also that it would be a very happy moment for me too when i should hand her over to mr porterfield  and will you come up today  no indeedi think shell do beautifully now  i heaved this time a sigh of relief  alls well that ends well  jasper spent that day a great deal of time with his mother  she had told me how much she had lacked hitherto proper opportunity to talk over with him their movements after disembarking  everything changes a little the last two or three days of a voyage the spell is broken and new combinations take place  grace mavis was neither on deck nor at dinner and i drew mrs pecks attention to the extreme propriety with which she now conducted herself  she had spent the day in meditation and judged it best to continue to meditate  ah shes afraid said my implacable neighbour  afraid of what  well that well tell tales when we get there  whom do you mean by we  well there are plentyon a ship like this  then i think i returned we wont  maybe we wont have the chance said the dreadful little woman  oh at that momenti spoke from a full experienceuniversal geniality reigns  mrs peck however knew little of any such law  i guess shes afraid all the same  so much the better  yesso much the better  all the next day too the girl remained invisible and mrs nettlepoint told me she hadnt looked in  she herself had accordingly inquired by the stewardess if she might be received in miss maviss own quarters and the young lady had replied that they were littered up with things and unfit for visitors she was packing a trunk over  jasper made up for his devotion to his mother the day before by now spending a great deal of his time in the smokingroom  i wanted to say to him this is much better but i thought it wiser to hold my tongue  indeed i had begun to feel the emotion of prospective arrivalthe sense of the return to europe always kept its intensityand had thereby the less attention for other matters it will doubtless appear to the critical reader that my expenditure of interest had been out of proportion to the vulgar appearances of which my story gives an account but to this i can only reply that the event was to justify me  we sighted land the dim yet rich coast of ireland about sunset and i leaned on the bulwark and took it in  it doesnt look like much does it i heard a voice say beside me whereupon turning i found grace mavis at hand  almost for the first time she had her veil up and i thought her very pale  it will be more tomorrow i said  oh yes a great deal more  the first sight of land at sea changes everything i went on  it always affects me as waking up from a dream  its a return to reality  for a moment she made me no response then she said it doesnt look very real yet  no and meanwhile this lovely evening one can put it that the dreams still present  she looked up at the sky which had a brightness though the light of the sun had left it and that of the stars hadnt begun  it is a lovely evening  oh yes with this we shall do  she stood some moments more while the growing dusk effaced the line of the land more rapidly than our progress made it distinct  she said nothing more she only looked in front of her but her very quietness prompted me to something suggestive of sympathy and service  it was difficult indeed to strike the right notesome things seemed too wide of the mark and others too importunate  at last unexpectedly she appeared to give me my chance  irrelevantly abruptly she broke out didnt you tell me you knew mr porterfield  dear me yesi used to see him  ive often wanted to speak to you of him  she turned her face on me and in the deepened evening i imagined her more pale  what good would that do  why it would be a pleasure i replied rather foolishly  do you mean for you  well yescall it that i smiled  did you know him so well  my smile became a laugh and i lost a little my confidence  youre not easy to make speeches to  i hate speeches  the words came from her lips with a force that surprised me they were loud and hard  but before i had time to wonder she went on a little differently  shall you know him when you see him  perfectly i think  her manner was so strange that i had to notice it in some way and i judged the best way was jocularly so i added shant you  oh perhaps youll point him out  and she walked quickly away  as i looked after her there came to me a perverse rather a provoking consciousness of having during the previous days and especially in speaking to jasper nettlepoint interfered with her situation in some degree to her loss  there was an odd pang for me in seeing her move about alone i felt somehow responsible for it and asked myself why i couldnt have kept my hands off  i had seen jasper in the smokingroom more than once that day as i passed it and half an hour before this had observed through the open door that he was there  he had been with her so much that without him she now struck one as bereaved and forsaken this was really better no doubt but superficially it movedand i admit with the last inconsequenceones pity  mrs peck would doubtless have assured me that their separation was gammon they didnt show together on deck and in the saloon but they made it up elsewhere  the secret places on shipboard are not numerous mrs pecks elsewhere would have been vague and i know not what licence her imagination took  it was distinct that jasper had fallen off but of course what had passed between them on this score wasnt so and could never be  later on through his mother i had his version of that but i may remark that i gave it no credit poor mrs nettlepoint on the other hand was of course to give it all  i was almost capable after the girl had left me of going to my young man and saying after all do return to her a little just till we get in it wont make any difference after we land  and i dont think it was the fear he would tell me i was an idiot that prevented me  at any rate the next time i passed the door of the smokingroom i saw he had left it i paid my usual visit to mrs nettlepoint that night but i troubled her no further about miss mavis  she had made up her mind that everything was smooth and settled now and it seemed to me i had worried her and that she had worried herself in sufficiency  i left her to enjoy the deepening foretaste of arrival which had taken possession of her mind before turning in i went above and found more passengers on deck than i had ever seen so late  jasper moved about among them alone but i forbore to join him  the coast of ireland had disappeared but the night and the sea were perfect  on the way to my cabin when i came down i met the stewardess in one of the passages and the idea entered my head to say to her do you happen to know where miss mavis is  why shes in her room sir at this hour  do you suppose i could speak to her  it had come into my mind to ask her why she had wanted to know of me if i should recognise mr porterfield  no sir said the stewardess she has gone to bed  thats all right  and i followed the young ladys excellent example  the next morning while i dressed the steward of my side of the ship came to me as usual to see what i wanted  but the first thing he said to me was rather a bad job sira passenger missing  and while i took i scarce know what instant chill from it a lady sir he went onwhom i think you knew  poor miss mavis sir  missing i criedstaring at him and horrorstricken  shes not on the ship  they cant find her  then where to god is she  i recall his queer face  well sir i suppose you know that as well as i  do you mean she has jumped overboard  some time in the night siron the quiet  but its beyond every one the way she escaped notice  they usually sees em sir  it must have been about halfpast two  lord but she was sharp sir  she didnt so much as make a splash  they say she ad come against her will sir  i had dropped upon my sofai felt faint  the man went on liking to talk as persons of his class do when they have something horrible to tell  she usually rang for the stewardess early but this morning of course there had been no ring  the stewardess had gone in all the same about eight oclock and found the cabin empty  that was about an hour previous  her things were there in confusionthe things she usually wore when she went above  the stewardess thought she had been a bit odd the night before but had waited a little and then gone back  miss mavis hadnt turned upand she didnt turn up  the stewardess began to look for hershe hadnt been seen on deck or in the saloon  besides she wasnt dressednot to show herself all her clothes were in her room there was another lady an old lady mrs nettlepointi would know herthat she was sometimes with but the stewardess had been with her and knew miss mavis hadnt come near her that morning  she had spoken to him and they had taken a quiet lookthey had hunted everywhere  a ships a big place but you did come to the end of it and if a person wasnt there why there it was  in short an hour had passed and the young lady was not accounted for from which i might judge if she ever would be  the watch couldnt account for her but no doubt the fishes in the sea couldpoor miserable pitiful lady  the stewardess and he had of course thought it their duty to speak at once to the doctor and the doctor had spoken immediately to the captain  the captain didnt like itthey never did but hed try to keep it quietthey always did  by the time i succeeded in pulling myself together and getting on after a fashion the rest of my clothes i had learned that mrs nettlepoint wouldnt yet have been told unless the stewardess had broken it to her within the previous few minutes  her son knew the young gentleman on the other side of the shiphe had the other steward my man had seen him come out of his cabin and rush above just before he came in to me  he had gone above my man was sure he hadnt gone to the old ladys cabin  i catch again the sense of my dreadfully seeing something at that moment catch the wild flash under the stewards words of jasper nettlepoint leaping with a mad compunction in his young agility over the side of the ship  i hasten to add however that no such incident was destined to contribute its horror to poor grace maviss unwitnessed and unlighted tragic act  what followed was miserable enough but i can only glance at it  when i got to mrs nettlepoints door she was there with a shawl about her the stewardess had just told her and she was dashing out to come to me  i made her go backi said i would go for jasper  i went for him but i missed him partly no doubt because it was really at first the captain i was after  i found this personage and found him highly scandalised but he gave me no hope that we were in error and his displeasure expressed with seamanlike strength was a definite settlement of the question  from the deck where i merely turned round and looked i saw the light of another summer day the coast of ireland green and near and the sea of a more charming colour than it had shown at all  when i came below again jasper had passed back he had gone to his cabin and his mother had joined him there  he remained there till we reached liverpooli never saw him  his mother after a little at his request left him alone  all the world went above to look at the land and chatter about our tragedy but the poor lady spent the day dismally enough in her room  it seemed to me the dreadful day intolerably long i was thinking so of vague of inconceivable yet inevitable porterfield and of my having to face him somehow on the morrow  now of course i knew why she had asked me if i should recognise him she had delegated to me mentally a certain pleasant office  i gave mrs peck and mrs gotch a wide berthi couldnt talk to them  i could or at least i did a little to mrs nettlepoint but with too many reserves for comfort on either side since i quite felt how little it would now make for ease to mention jasper to her  i was obliged to assume by my silence that he had had nothing to do with what had happened and of course i never really ascertained what he had had to do  the secret of what passed between him and the strange girl who would have sacrificed her marriage to him on so short an acquaintance remains shut up in his breast  his mother i know went to his door from time to time but he refused her admission  that evening to be human at a venture i requested the steward to go in and ask him if he should care to see me and the good man returned with an answer which he candidly transmitted  not in the leastjasper apparently was almost as scandalised as the captain  at liverpool at the dock when we had touched twenty people came on board and i had already made out mr porterfield at a distance  he was looking up at the side of the great vessel with disappointment writtenfor my strained eyesin his face disappointment at not seeing the woman he had so long awaited lean over it and wave her handkerchief to him  every one was looking at him every one but shehis identity flew about in a momentand i wondered if it didnt strike him  he used to be gaunt and angular but had grown almost fat and stooped a little the interval between us diminishedhe was on the plank and then on the deck with the jostling agents of the customs too soon for my equanimity i met him instantly however to save him from exposurelaid my hand on him and drew him away though i was sure he had no impression of having seen me before  it was not till afterwards that i thought this rather characteristically dull of him  i drew him far awayi was conscious of mrs peck and mrs gotch looking at us as we passedinto the empty stale smokingroom he remained speechless and that struck me as like him  i had to speak first he couldnt even relieve me by saying is anything the matter  i broke ground by putting it feebly that she was ill  it was a dire moment
