48302272	the parenticide club   by  ambrose bierce     contents   my favorite murder oil of dog an imperfect conflagration the hypnotist     my favorite murder   having murdered my mother under circumstances of singular atrocity i was arrested and put upon my trial which lasted seven years  in charging the jury the judge of the court of acquittal remarked that it was one of the most ghastly crimes that he had ever been called upon to explain away  at this my attorney rose and said  may it please your honor crimes are ghastly or agreeable only by comparison  if you were familiar with the details of my clients previous murder of his uncle you would discern in his later offense if offense it may be called something in the nature of tender forbearance and filial consideration for the feelings of the victim the appalling ferocity of the former assassination was indeed inconsistent with any hypothesis but that of guilt and had it not been for the fact that the honorable judge before whom he was tried was the president of a life insurance company that took risks on hanging and in which my client held a policy it is hard to see how he could decently have been acquitted  if your honor would like to hear about it for instruction and guidance of your honors mind this unfortunate man my client will consent to give himself the pain of relating it under oath  the district attorney said your honor i object  such a statement would be in the nature of evidence and the testimony in this case is closed  the prisoners statement should have been introduced three years ago in the spring of 1881  in a statutory sense said the judge you are right and in the court of objections and technicalities you would get a ruling in your favor  but not in a court of acquittal  the objection is overruled  i except said the district attorney  you cannot do that the judge said  i must remind you that in order to take an exception you must first get this case transferred for a time to the court of exceptions on a formal motion duly supported by affidavits  a motion to that effect by your predecessor in office was denied by me during the first year of this trial  mr clerk swear the prisoner  the customary oath having been administered i made the following statement which impressed the judge with so strong a sense of the comparative triviality of the offense for which i was on trial that he made no further search for mitigating circumstances but simply instructed the jury to acquit and i left the court without a stain upon my reputation  i was born in 1856 in kalamakee mich of honest and reputable parents one of whom heaven has mercifully spared to comfort me in my later years  in 1867 the family came to california and settled near nigger head where my father opened a road agency and prospered beyond the dreams of avarice  he was a reticent saturnine man then though his increasing years have now somewhat relaxed the austerity of his disposition and i believe that nothing but his memory of the sad event for which i am now on trial prevents him from manifesting a genuine hilarity  four years after we had set up the road agency an itinerant preacher came along and having no other way to pay for the nights lodging that we gave him favored us with an exhortation of such power that praise god we were all converted to religion  my father at once sent for his brother the hon william ridley of stockton and on his arrival turned over the agency to him charging him nothing for the franchise nor plantthe latter consisting of a winchester rifle a sawedoff shotgun and an assortment of masks made out of flour sacks the family then moved to ghost rock and opened a dance house  it was called the saints rest hurdygurdy and the proceedings each night began with prayer  it was there that my now sainted mother by her grace in the dance acquired the sobriquet of the bucking walrus  in the fall of 75 i had occasion to visit coyote on the road to mahala and took the stage at ghost rock  there were four other passengers  about three miles beyond nigger head persons whom i identified as my uncle william and his two sons held up the stage finding nothing in the express box they went through the passengers i acted a most honorable part in the affair placing myself in line with the others holding up my hands and permitting myself to be deprived of forty dollars and a gold watch  from my behavior no one could have suspected that i knew the gentlemen who gave the entertainment  a few days later when i went to nigger head and asked for the return of my money and watch my uncle and cousins swore they knew nothing of the matter and they affected a belief that my father and i had done the job ourselves in dishonest violation of commercial good faith  uncle william even threatened to retaliate by starting an opposition dance house at ghost rock  as the saints rest had become rather unpopular i saw that this would assuredly ruin it and prove a paying enterprise so i told my uncle that i was willing to overlook the past if he would take me into the scheme and keep the partnership a secret from my father  this fair offer he rejected and i then perceived that it would be better and more satisfactory if he were dead  my plans to that end were soon perfected and communicating them to my dear parents i had the gratification of receiving their approval my father said he was proud of me and my mother promised that although her religion forbade her to assist in taking human life i should have the advantage of her prayers for my success  as a preliminary measure looking to my security in case of detection i made an application for membership in that powerful order the knights of murder and in due course was received as a member of the ghost rock commandery  on the day that my probation ended i was for the first time permitted to inspect the records of the order and learn who belonged to itall the rites of initiation having been conducted in masks  fancy my delight when in looking over the roll of membership i found the third name to be that of my uncle who indeed was junior vicechancellor of the order  here was an opportunity exceeding my wildest dreamsto murder i could add insubordination and treachery it was what my good mother would have called a special providence  at about this time something occurred which caused my cup of joy already full to overflow on all sides a circular cataract of bliss three men strangers in that locality were arrested for the stage robbery in which i had lost my money and watch  they were brought to trial and despite my efforts to clear them and fasten the guilt upon three of the most respectable and worthy citizens of ghost rock convicted on the clearest proof  the murder would now be as wanton and reasonless as i could wish  one morning i shouldered my winchester rifle and going over to my uncles house near nigger head asked my aunt mary his wife if he were at home adding that i had come to kill him  my aunt replied with her peculiar smile that so many gentlemen called on that errand and were afterward carried away without having performed it that i must excuse her for doubting my good faith in the matter  she said i did not look as if i would kill anybody so as a proof of good faith i leveled my rifle and wounded a chinaman who happened to be passing the house  she said she knew whole families that could do a thing of that kind but bill ridley was a horse of another color  she said however that i would find him over on the other side of the creek in the sheep lot and she added that she hoped the best man would win  my aunt mary was one of the most fairminded women that i have ever met  i found my uncle down on his knees engaged in skinning a sheep seeing that he had neither gun nor pistol handy i had not the heart to shoot him so i approached him greeted him pleasantly and struck him a powerful blow on the head with the butt of my rifle  i have a very good delivery and uncle william lay down on his side then rolled over on his back spread out his fingers and shivered  before he could recover the use of his limbs i seized the knife that he had been using and cut his hamstrings  you know doubtless that when you sever the tendo achillis the patient has no further use of his leg it is just the same as if he had no leg  well i parted them both and when he revived he was at my service  as soon as he comprehended the situation he said  samuel you have got the drop on me and can afford to be generous i have only one thing to ask of you and that is that you carry me to the house and finish me in the bosom of my family  i told him i thought that a pretty reasonable request and i would do so if he would let me put him into a wheat sack he would be easier to carry that way and if we were seen by the neighbors en route it would cause less remark  he agreed to that and going to the barn i got a sack  this however did not fit him it was too short and much wider than he so i bent his legs forced his knees up against his breast and got him into it that way tying the sack above his head he was a heavy man and i had all that i could do to get him on my back but i staggered along for some distance until i came to a swing that some of the children had suspended to the branch of an oak  here i laid him down and sat upon him to rest and the sight of the rope gave me a happy inspiration  in twenty minutes my uncle still in the sack swung free to the sport of the wind  i had taken down the rope tied one end tightly about the mouth of the bag thrown the other across the limb and hauled him up about five feet from the ground  fastening the other end of the rope also about the mouth of the sack i had the satisfaction to see my uncle converted into a large fine pendulum  i must add that he was not himself entirely aware of the nature of the change that he had undergone in his relation to the exterior world though in justice to a good mans memory i ought to say that i do not think he would in any case have wasted much of my time in vain remonstrance  uncle william had a ram that was famous in all that region as a fighter  it was in a state of chronic constitutional indignation some deep disappointment in early life had soured its disposition and it had declared war upon the whole world  to say that it would butt anything accessible is but faintly to express the nature and scope of its military activity the universe was its antagonist its methods that of a projectile  it fought like the angels and devils in midair cleaving the atmosphere like a bird describing a parabolic curve and descending upon its victim at just the exact angle of incidence to make the most of its velocity and weight  its momentum calculated in foottons was something incredible  it had been seen to destroy a four year old bull by a single impact upon that animals gnarly forehead  no stone wall had ever been known to resist its downward swoop there were no trees tough enough to stay it it would splinter them into matchwood and defile their leafy honors in the dust  this irascible and implacable brutethis incarnate thunderboltthis monster of the upper deep i had seen reposing in the shade of an adjacent tree dreaming dreams of conquest and glory it was with a view to summoning it forth to the field of honor that i suspended its master in the manner described  having completed my preparations i imparted to the avuncular pendulum a gentle oscillation and retiring to cover behind a contiguous rock lifted up my voice in a long rasping cry whose diminishing final note was drowned in a noise like that of a swearing cat which emanated from the sack  instantly that formidable sheep was upon its feet and had taken in the military situation at a glance in a few moments it had approached stamping to within fifty yards of the swinging foeman who now retreating and anon advancing seemed to invite the fray  suddenly i saw the beasts head drop earthward as if depressed by the weight of its enormous horns then a dim white wavy streak of sheep prolonged itself from that spot in a generally horizontal direction to within about four yards of a point immediately beneath the enemy  there it struck sharply upward and before it had faded from my gaze at the place whence it had set out i heard a horrid thump and a piercing scream and my poor uncle shot forward with a slack rope higher than the limb to which he was attached  here the rope tautened with a jerk arresting his flight and back he swung in a breathless curve to the other end of his arc  the ram had fallen a heap of indistinguishable legs wool and horns but pulling itself together and dodging as its antagonist swept downward it retired at random alternately shaking its head and stamping its forefeet  when it had backed about the same distance as that from which it had delivered the assault it paused again bowed its head as if in prayer for victory and again shot forward dimly visible as beforea prolonging white streak with monstrous undulations ending with a sharp ascension  its course this time was at a right angle to its former one and its impatience so great that it struck the enemy before he had nearly reached the lowest point of his arc  in consequence he went flying round and round in a horizontal circle whose radius was about equal to half the length of the rope which i forgot to say was nearly twenty feet long  his shrieks crescendo in approach and diminuendo in recession made the rapidity of his revolution more obvious to the ear than to the eye  he had evidently not yet been struck in a vital spot  his posture in the sack and the distance from the ground at which he hung compelled the ram to operate upon his lower extremities and the end of his back  like a plant that has struck its root into some poisonous mineral my poor uncle was dying slowly upward  after delivering its second blow the ram had not again retired  the fever of battle burned hot in its heart its brain was intoxicated with the wine of strife  like a pugilist who in his rage forgets his skill and fights ineffectively at halfarms length the angry beast endeavored to reach its fleeting foe by awkward vertical leaps as he passed overhead sometimes indeed succeeding in striking him feebly but more frequently overthrown by its own misguided eagerness  but as the impetus was exhausted and the mans circles narrowed in scope and diminished in speed bringing him nearer to the ground these tactics produced better results eliciting a superior quality of screams which i greatly enjoyed  suddenly as if the bugles had sung truce the ram suspended hostilities and walked away thoughtfully wrinkling and smoothing its great aquiline nose and occasionally cropping a bunch of grass and slowly munching it  it seemed to have tired of wars alarms and resolved to beat the sword into a plowshare and cultivate the arts of peace  steadily it held its course away from the field of fame until it had gained a distance of nearly a quarter of a mile  there it stopped and stood with its rear to the foe chewing its cud and apparently half asleep  i observed however an occasional slight turn of its head as if its apathy were more affected than real  meantime uncle williams shrieks had abated with his motion and nothing was heard from him but long low moans and at long intervals my name uttered in pleading tones exceedingly grateful to my ear evidently the man had not the faintest notion of what was being done to him and was inexpressibly terrified  when death comes cloaked in mystery he is terrible indeed  little by little my uncles oscillations diminished and finally he hung motionless  i went to him and was about to give him the coup de grace when i heard and felt a succession of smart shocks which shook the ground like a series of light earthquakes and turning in the direction of the ram saw a long cloud of dust approaching me with inconceivable rapidity and alarming effect  at a distance of some thirty yards away it stopped short and from the near end of it rose into the air what i at first thought a great white bird  its ascent was so smooth and easy and regular that i could not realize its extraordinary celerity and was lost in admiration of its grace  to this day the impression remains that it was a slow deliberate movement the ramfor it was that animalbeing upborne by some power other than its own impetus and supported through the successive stages of its flight with infinite tenderness and care  my eyes followed its progress through the air with unspeakable pleasure all the greater by contrast with my former terror of its approach by land  onward and upward the noble animal sailed its head bent down almost between its knees its forefeet thrown back its hinder legs trailing to rear like the legs of a soaring heron  at a height of forty or fifty feet as fond recollection presents it to view it attained its zenith and appeared to remain an instant stationary then tilting suddenly forward without altering the relative position of its parts it shot downward on a steeper and steeper course with augmenting velocity passed immediately above me with a noise like the rush of a cannon shot and struck my poor uncle almost squarely on the top of the head  so frightful was the impact that not only the mans neck was broken but the rope too and the body of the deceased forced against the earth was crushed to pulp beneath the awful front of that meteoric sheep  the concussion stopped all the clocks between lone hand and dutch dans and professor davidson a distinguished authority in matters seismic who happened to be in the vicinity promptly explained that the vibrations were from north to southwest  altogether i cannot help thinking that in point of artistic atrocity my murder of uncle william has seldom been excelled     oil of dog   my name is boffer bings  i was born of honest parents in one of the humbler walks of life my father being a manufacturer of dogoil and my mother having a small studio in the shadow of the village church where she disposed of unwelcome babes  in my boyhood i was trained to habits of industry i not only assisted my father in procuring dogs for his vats but was frequently employed by my mother to carry away the debris of her work in the studio  in performance of this duty i sometimes had need of all my natural intelligence for all the law officers of the vicinity were opposed to my mothers business  they were not elected on an opposition ticket and the matter had never been made a political issue it just happened so  my fathers business of making dogoil was naturally less unpopular though the owners of missing dogs sometimes regarded him with suspicion which was reflected to some extent upon me  my father had as silent partners all the physicians of the town who seldom wrote a prescription which did not contain what they were pleased to designate as ol can  it is really the most valuable medicine ever discovered  but most persons are unwilling to make personal sacrifices for the afflicted and it was evident that many of the fattest dogs in town had been forbidden to play with mea fact which pained my young sensibilities and at one time came near driving me to become a pirate  looking back upon those days i cannot but regret at times that by indirectly bringing my beloved parents to their death i was the author of misfortunes profoundly affecting my future  one evening while passing my fathers oil factory with the body of a foundling from my mothers studio i saw a constable who seemed to be closely watching my movements  young as i was i had learned that a constables acts of whatever apparent character are prompted by the most reprehensible motives and i avoided him by dodging into the oilery by a side door which happened to stand ajar  i locked it at once and was alone with my dead  my father had retired for the night the only light in the place came from the furnace which glowed a deep rich crimson under one of the vats casting ruddy reflections on the walls  within the cauldron the oil still rolled in indolent ebullition occasionally pushing to the surface a piece of dog seating myself to wait for the constable to go away i held the naked body of the foundling in my lap and tenderly stroked its short silken hair  ah how beautiful it was  even at that early age i was passionately fond of children and as i looked upon this cherub i could almost find it in my heart to wish that the small red wound upon its breastthe work of my dear motherhad not been mortal  it had been my custom to throw the babes into the river which nature had thoughtfully provided for the purpose but that night i did not dare to leave the oilery for fear of the constable  after all i said to myself it cannot greatly matter if i put it into this cauldron  my father will never know the bones from those of a puppy and the few deaths which may result from administering another kind of oil for the incomparable ol can are not important in a population which increases so rapidly  in short i took the first step in crime and brought myself untold sorrow by casting the babe into the cauldron  the next day somewhat to my surprise my father rubbing his hands with satisfaction informed me and my mother that he had obtained the finest quality of oil that was ever seen that the physicians to whom he had shown samples had so pronounced it  he added that he had no knowledge as to how the result was obtained the dogs had been treated in all respects as usual and were of an ordinary breed  i deemed it my duty to explainwhich i did though palsied would have been my tongue if i could have foreseen the consequences  bewailing their previous ignorance of the advantages of combining their industries my parents at once took measures to repair the error  my mother removed her studio to a wing of the factory building and my duties in connection with the business ceased i was no longer required to dispose of the bodies of the small superfluous and there was no need of alluring dogs to their doom for my father discarded them altogether though they still had an honorable place in the name of the oil  so suddenly thrown into idleness i might naturally have been expected to become vicious and dissolute but i did not  the holy influence of my dear mother was ever about me to protect me from the temptations which beset youth and my father was a deacon in a church  alas that through my fault these estimable persons should have come to so bad an end  finding a double profit in her business my mother now devoted herself to it with a new assiduity  she removed not only superfluous and unwelcome babes to order but went out into the highways and byways gathering in children of a larger growth and even such adults as she could entice to the oilery  my father too enamored of the superior quality of oil produced purveyed for his vats with diligence and zeal  the conversion of their neighbors into dogoil became in short the one passion of their livesan absorbing and overwhelming greed took possession of their souls and served them in place of a hope in heavenby which also they were inspired  so enterprising had they now become that a public meeting was held and resolutions passed severely censuring them  it was intimated by the chairman that any further raids upon the population would be met in a spirit of hostility  my poor parents left the meeting brokenhearted desperate and i believe not altogether sane  anyhow i deemed it prudent not to enter the oilery with them that night but slept outside in a stable  at about midnight some mysterious impulse caused me to rise and peer through a window into the furnaceroom where i knew my father now slept  the fires were burning as brightly as if the following days harvest had been expected to be abundant  one of the large cauldrons was slowly walloping with a mysterious appearance of selfrestraint as if it bided its time to put forth its full energy  my father was not in bed he had risen in his night clothes and was preparing a noose in a strong cord  from the looks which he cast at the door of my mothers bedroom i knew too well the purpose that he had in mind speechless and motionless with terror i could do nothing in prevention or warning  suddenly the door of my mothers apartment was opened noiselessly and the two confronted each other both apparently surprised  the lady also was in her night clothes and she held in her right hand the tool of her trade a long narrowbladed dagger  she too had been unable to deny herself the last profit which the unfriendly action of the citizens and my absence had left her  for one instant they looked into each others blazing eyes and then sprang together with indescribable fury  round and round the room they struggled the man cursing the woman shrieking both fighting like demonsshe to strike him with the dagger he to strangle her with his great bare hands  i know not how long i had the unhappiness to observe this disagreeable instance of domestic infelicity but at last after a more than usually vigorous struggle the combatants suddenly moved apart  my fathers breast and my mothers weapon showed evidences of contact for another instant they glared at each other in the most unamiable way then my poor wounded father feeling the hand of death upon him leaped forward unmindful of resistance grasped my dear mother in his arms dragged her to the side of the boiling cauldron collected all his failing energies and sprang in with her  in a moment both had disappeared and were adding their oil to that of the committee of citizens who had called the day before with an invitation to the public meeting  convinced that these unhappy events closed to me every avenue to an honorable career in that town i removed to the famous city of otumwee where these memoirs are written with a heart full of remorse for a heedless act entailing so dismal a commercial disaster     an imperfect conflagration   early one june morning in 1872 i murdered my fatheran act which made a deep impression on me at the time  this was before my marriage while i was living with my parents in wisconsin  my father and i were in the library of our home dividing the proceeds of a burglary which we had committed that night  these consisted of household goods mostly and the task of equitable division was difficult  we got on very well with the napkins towels and such things and the silverware was parted pretty nearly equally but you can see for yourself that when you try to divide a single musicbox by two without a remainder you will have trouble  it was that musicbox which brought disaster and disgrace upon our family  if we had left it my poor father might now be alive  it was a most exquisite and beautiful piece of workmanshipinlaid with costly woods and carven very curiously  it would not only play a great variety of tunes but would whistle like a quail bark like a dog crow every morning at daylight whether it was wound up or not and break the ten commandments  it was this last mentioned accomplishment that won my fathers heart and caused him to commit the only dishonorable act of his life though possibly he would have committed more if he had been spared he tried to conceal that musicbox from me and declared upon his honor that he had not taken it though i know very well that so far as he was concerned the burglary had been undertaken chiefly for the purpose of obtaining it  my father had the musicbox hidden under his cloak we had worn cloaks by way of disguise  he had solemnly assured me that he did not take it  i knew that he did and knew something of which he was evidently ignorant namely that the box would crow at daylight and betray him if i could prolong the division of profits till that time  all occurred as i wished as the gaslight began to pale in the library and the shape of the windows was seen dimly behind the curtains a long cockadoodledoo came from beneath the old gentlemans cloak followed by a few bars of an aria from tannhauser ending with a loud click  a small handaxe which we had used to break into the unlucky house lay between us on the table i picked it up  the old man seeing that further concealment was useless took the box from under his cloak and set it on the table  cut it in two if you prefer that plan said he i tried to save it from destruction  he was a passionate lover of music and could himself play the concertina with expression and feeling  i said i do not question the purity of your motive it would be presumptuous of me to sit in judgment on my father  but business is business and with this axe i am going to effect a dissolution of our partnership unless you will consent in all future burglaries to wear a bellpunch  no he said after some reflection no i could not do that it would look like a confession of dishonesty  people would say that you distrusted me  i could not help admiring his spirit and sensitiveness for a moment i was proud of him and disposed to overlook his fault but a glance at the richly jeweled musicbox decided me and as i said i removed the old man from this vale of tears  having done so i was a trifle uneasy  not only was he my fatherthe author of my beingbut the body would be certainly discovered  it was now broad daylight and my mother was likely to enter the library at any moment  under the circumstances i thought it expedient to remove her also which i did then i paid off all the servants and discharged them  that afternoon i went to the chief of police told him what i had done and asked his advice  it would be very painful to me if the facts became publicly known  my conduct would be generally condemned the newspapers would bring it up against me if ever i should run for office  the chief saw the force of these considerations he was himself an assassin of wide experience  after consulting with the presiding judge of the court of variable jurisdiction he advised me to conceal the bodies in one of the bookcases get a heavy insurance on the house and burn it down  this i proceeded to do  in the library was a bookcase which my father had recently purchased of some cranky inventor and had not filled  it was in shape and size something like the oldfashioned wardrobes which one sees in bedrooms without closets but opened all the way down like a womans nightdress  it had glass doors  i had recently laid out my parents and they were now rigid enough to stand erect so i stood them in this bookcase from which i had removed the shelves  i locked them in and tacked some curtains over the glass doors  the inspector from the insurance office passed a halfdozen times before the case without suspicion  that night after getting my policy i set fire to the house and started through the woods to town two miles away where i managed to be found about the time the excitement was at its height  with cries of apprehension for the fate of my parents i joined the rush and arrived at the fire some two hours after i had kindled it  the whole town was there as i dashed up  the house was entirely consumed but in one end of the level bed of glowing embers bolt upright and uninjured was that bookcase  the curtains had burned away exposing the glassdoors through which the fierce red light illuminated the interior  there stood my dear father in his habit as he lived and at his side the partner of his joys and sorrows  not a hair of them was singed their clothing was intact  on their heads and throats the injuries which in the accomplishment of my designs i had been compelled to inflict were conspicuous  as in the presence of a miracle the people were silent awe and terror had stilled every tongue  i was myself greatly affected  some three years later when the events herein related had nearly faded from my memory i went to new york to assist in passing some counterfeit united states bonds  carelessly looking into a furniture store one day i saw the exact counterpart of that bookcase  i bought it for a trifle from a reformed inventor the dealer explained  he said it was fireproof the pores of the wood being filled with alum under hydraulic pressure and the glass made of asbestos  i dont suppose it is really fireproofyou can have it at the price of an ordinary bookcase  no i said if you cannot warrant it fireproof i wont take itand i bade him good morning  i would not have had it at any price it revived memories that were exceedingly disagreeable     the hypnotist   by those of my friends who happen to know that i sometimes amuse myself with hypnotism mind reading and kindred phenomena i am frequently asked if i have a clear conception of the nature of whatever principle underlies them  to this question i always reply that i neither have nor desire to have  i am no investigator with an ear at the keyhole of natures workshop trying with vulgar curiosity to steal the secrets of her trade  the interests of science are as little to me as mine seem to have been to science  doubtless the phenomena in question are simple enough and in no way transcend our powers of comprehension if only we could find the clew but for my part i prefer not to find it for i am of a singularly romantic disposition deriving more gratification from mystery than from knowledge  it was commonly remarked of me when i was a child that my big blue eyes appeared to have been made rather to look into than look out ofsuch was their dreamful beauty and in my frequent periods of abstraction their indifference to what was going on  in those peculiarities they resembled i venture to think the soul which lies behind them always more intent upon some lovely conception which it has created in its own image than concerned about the laws of nature and the material frame of things  all this irrelevant and egotistic as it may seem is related by way of accounting for the meagreness of the light that i am able to throw upon a subject that has engaged so much of my attention and concerning which there is so keen and general a curiosity  with my powers and opportunities another person might doubtless have an explanation for much of what i present simply as narrative  my first knowledge that i possessed unusual powers came to me in my fourteenth year when at school  happening one day to have forgotten to bring my noonday luncheon i gazed longingly at that of a small girl who was preparing to eat hers  looking up her eyes met mine and she seemed unable to withdraw them  after a moment of hesitancy she came forward in an absent kind of way and without a word surrendered her little basket with its tempting contents and walked away inexpressibly pleased i relieved my hunger and destroyed the basket after that i had not the trouble to bring a luncheon for myself that little girl was my daily purveyor and not infrequently in satisfying my simple need from her frugal store i combined pleasure and profit by constraining her attendance at the feast and making misleading proffer of the viands which eventually i consumed to the last fragment  the girl was always persuaded that she had eaten all herself and later in the day her tearful complaints of hunger surprised the teacher entertained the pupils earned for her the sobriquet of greedygut and filled me with a peace past understanding  a disagreeable feature of this otherwise satisfactory condition of things was the necessary secrecy the transfer of the luncheon for example had to be made at some distance from the madding crowd in a wood and i blush to think of the many other unworthy subterfuges entailed by the situation  as i was and am naturally of a frank and open disposition these became more and more irksome and but for the reluctance of my parents to renounce the obvious advantages of the new regime i would gladly have reverted to the old  the plan that i finally adopted to free myself from the consequences of my own powers excited a wide and keen interest at the time and that part of it which consisted in the death of the girl was severely condemned but it is hardly pertinent to the scope of this narrative  for some years afterward i had little opportunity to practice hypnotism such small essays as i made at it were commonly barren of other recognition than solitary confinement on a breadandwater diet sometimes indeed they elicited nothing better than the catoninetails  it was when i was about to leave the scene of these small disappointments that my one really important feat was performed  i had been called into the wardens office and given a suit of civilians clothing a trifling sum of money and a great deal of advice which i am bound to confess was of a much better quality than the clothing  as i was passing out of the gate into the light of freedom i suddenly turned and looking the warden gravely in the eye soon had him in control  you are an ostrich i said  at the postmortem examination the stomach was found to contain a great quantity of indigestible articles mostly of wood or metal stuck fast in the esophagus and constituting according to the coroners jury the immediate cause of death one doorknob  i was by nature a good and affectionate son but as i took my way into the great world from which i had been so long secluded i could not help remembering that all my misfortunes had flowed like a stream from the niggard economy of my parents in the matter of school luncheons and i knew of no reason to think they had reformed  on the road between succotash hill and south asphyxia is a little open field which once contained a shanty known as pete gilstraps place where that gentleman used to murder travelers for a living  the death of mr gilstrap and the diversion of nearly all the travel to another road occurred so nearly at the same time that no one has ever been able to say which was cause and which effect  anyhow the field was now a desolation and the place had long been burned  it was while going afoot to south asphyxia the home of my childhood that i found both my parents on their way to the hill  they had hitched their team and were eating luncheon under an oak tree in the center of the field the sight of the luncheon called up painful memories of my school days and roused the sleeping lion in my breast  approaching the guilty couple who at once recognized me i ventured to suggest that i share their hospitality  of this cheer my son said the author of my being with characteristic pomposity which age had not withered there is sufficient for but two  i am not i hope insensible to the hungerlight in your eyes but  my father has never completed that sentence what he mistook for hungerlight was simply the earnest gaze of the hypnotist  in a few seconds he was at my service  a few more sufficed for the lady and the dictates of a just resentment could be carried into effect  my former father i said i presume that it is known to you that you and this lady are no longer what you were  i have observed a certain subtle change was the rather dubious reply of the old gentleman it is perhaps attributable to age  it is more than that i explained it goes to characterto species  you and the lady here are in truth two broncoswild stallions both and unfriendly  why john exclaimed my dear mother you dont mean to say that i am  madam i replied solemnly fixing my eyes again upon hers you are  scarcely had the words fallen from my lips when she dropped upon her hands and knees and backing up to the old man squealed like a demon and delivered a vicious kick upon his shin  an instant later he was himself down on allfours headed away from her and flinging his feet at her simultaneously and successively  with equal earnestness but inferior agility because of her hampering bodygear she plied her own  their flying legs crossed and mingled in the most bewildering way their feet sometimes meeting squarely in midair their bodies thrust forward falling flat

struck savagely at each other with awkward descending blows of both fists at once and dropped again upon their hands as if unable to maintain the upright position of the body grass and pebbles were

was and have ever since been tried in the court of technicalities and continuances whence after fifteen years of proceedings my attorney is moving heaven and earth to get the case taken to the court

unworthy purpose i am unable to say
