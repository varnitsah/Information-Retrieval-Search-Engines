9388165	rivers of ice by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the rovers return  on a certain summer morning about the middle of the present century a big bluff man of seafaring aspect found himself sauntering in a certain street near london bridge  he was a man of above fifty but looked under forty in consequence of the healthful vigour of his frame the freshness of his saltwater face and the blackness of his shaggy hair  although his gait pilotcloth coat and pocketed hands proclaimed him a sailor there were one or two contradictory points about him  a huge beard and moustache savoured more of the diggings than the deep and a brown wideawake with a prodigiously broad brim suggested the backwoods  pausing at the head of one of those narrow lanes whichrunning down between warehouses filthy little rag and bone shops and low povertystricken dwellingsappear to terminate their career not unwillingly in the thames the sailor gazed before him with nautical earnestness for a few seconds then glanced at the corner house for a name found no name cast his eyes up to the strip of blue sky overhead as if for inspiration obtained none planted his legs wide apart as if he had observed a squall coming and expected the lane to lurch heavilywrinkled his eyebrows and pursed his lips  lost yer bearins cappn exclaimed a shrill pert voice at his side  the seaman looked down and beheld a small boy with a head like a disorderly doormat and garments to match  he stood in what may be styled an imitative attitude with his hands thrust into his ragged pockets his little legs planted wide apart his cap thrust well back on his head and his eyebrows wrinkled  he also pursed his lips to such an extent that they resembled a rosebud in a dirty bush  yes imp replied the seamanhe meant to have said impudence but stopped at the first syllable as being sufficiently appropriateyes imp i have lost my bearings and ill give you a copper if youll help me to find em  wot sort o copper demanded the urchin theres three sorts of em you know in this ere kingdomwhich appears to be a queendom at presenttheres a farding and a hapenny and a penny  i mention it cappn he added apologetically in case you dont know for you look as if youd come from furrin parts  the seamans look of surprise melted into a broad grin of amusement while this speech was being fluently delivered  at its conclusion he pulled out a penny and held it up  well it aint much said the small boy and i aint used to hire myself out so cheap  however as you seem to be raither poorly off i dont mind if i lend you a hand for that  only please dont mention it among your friends as it would praps lower their opinion of you dyou see  now then wot dyou want to know  to this the cappn still smiling at the small boys precocious insolence replied that he was in search of an old woman who dwelt in a small court styled grubbs court so he was told which lay somewhere in that salubrious neighbourhood and asked if he the imp knew of such a place  knows of it  i should think i does  wy i lives there  its right down at the foot o this ere lane an a wery sweet ristocratik spot it isquite a perninsular bein land leastwise mud amost surrounded by water the air bein ighly condoosive to the ealth of rats likewise cats  as to old women theres raither a broad sprinklin of em in the court rangin from the ages of seventy to a hundred an twenty more or less an youll take some time to go over em all cappn if you dont know your old womans name  her name is roby said the seaman  o roby ah returned the small boy looking sedately at the ground let me seeyes thats the name of the old ooman i think wot angs out in the cabin rightand stair top floor end of the passage were most wisiters flattens their noses by consekince of there bein no light and a step close to the door which inwariably trips em up  most wisiters to that old ooman begins their acquaintance with her by knocking at her door with their noses instead of their knuckles  we calls her place the cabin cause the windows is raither small and overangs the river  well then my lad said the seaman clap a stopper on your tongue if you can and heave ahead  all right cappn returned the small boy foller me an dont be frightened  port your helm a bit here theres a quicksand in the middle o the trackso steady  avoiding a large pool of mud with which the head of the lane was garnished and which might have been styled the bathing not to say wallowing quarters of the grubbs court juveniles the small boy led the bluff seaman towards the river without further remark diverging only once from the straight road for a few seconds for the purpose of making a furious rush at a sleeping cat with a yell worthy of a cherokee savage or a locomotive whistle a slight pleasantry which had the double effect of shooting the cat through space in glaring convulsions and filling the small boys mind with the placidity which naturally follows a great success  the lane presented this peculiarity that the warehouses on its left side became more and more solid and vast and tall as they neared the river while the shops and dwellings on its right became poorer meaner and more diminutive in the same direction as if there were some mysterious connection between them which involved the adversity of the one in exact proportion to the prosperity of the other  children and cats appeared to be the chief daypopulation of the place and these disported themselves among the wheels of enormous waggons and the legs of elephantine horses with an impunity which could only have been the result of lifelong experience  the seaman was evidently unaccustomed to such scenes for more than once during the short period of his progress down the lane he uttered an exclamation of alarm and sprang to the rescue of those large babies which are supposed to have grown sufficiently old to become nursing mothers to smaller babiesacts which were viewed with a look of pity by the small boy and called from him the encouraging observations keep your mind easy cappn theyre all right bless you the hosses knows em and wouldnt urt em on no account  this is grubbs court said the boy turning sharply to the right and passing through a low archway  thank ee lad said the seaman giving him a sixpence  the small boy opened his eyes very wide indeed exclaiming hallo  i say cappn wots this at the same time however putting the coin in his pocket with an air which plainly said whether youve made a mistake or not you neednt expect to get it back again  evidently the seaman entertained no such expectations for he turned away and became absorbed in the scene around him  it was not cheering  though the summer sun was high and powerful it failed to touch the broken pavement of grubbs court or to dry up the moisture which oozed from it and crept up the walls of the surrounding houses  everything was very old very rotten very crooked and very dirty  the doorways round the court were wide openalways openin some cases because of there being no doors in other cases because the tenements to which they led belonged to a variety of families largely composed of children who could not even on tiptoe reach or manipulate doorhandles  nursing mothers of two feet high were numerous staggering about with nurslings of a foot and a half long  a few of the nurslings temporarily abandoned by the premature mothers lay sprawlingin some cases squallingon the moist pavement getting over the ground like large snails and leaving slimy tracks behind them little boys of the city arab type were sprinkled here and there and one or two old women sat on doorsteps contemplating the scene or conversing with one or two younger women  some of the latter were busy washing garments so dirty that the dirty water of old father thames seemed quite a suitable purifier  gillie cried one of the younger women referred to wiping the soapsuds from her red arms come here you bad naughty boy  were ave you bin  i want you to mind baby  wy mother cried the small boywho answered to the name of gilliedont you see im engaged  im ashowin this ere seacappn the course hes got to steer for port  he wants to make the cabin of old mother roby  wy dont you do it quickly then demanded gillies mother you bad naughty wicked boy  beg your parding sir she added to the seaman the boy ant got no sense besides bein wicked and naughtye aint ad no train sir thats were it is all along of my avin too much to do an a large family sir with no usband to speak of right up the stair sir to the top and along the passagedoor straight before you at the hend of it  mind the step sir wen you gits up  go up with the gentleman you bad wicked naughty boy and show  the remainder of the sentence became confused in distance as the boy and the seaman climbed the stair but a continuous murmuring sound as of a vocal torrent conveyed the assurance that the mother of gillie was still holding forth  ere it is said the young pilot pausing at the top of the staircase near the entrance to a very dark passage  keep er ead as she goes but id recommend you to shorten sail mind your elm an ave the anchor ready to let go  having thus accommodated his language to the supposed intelligence of the seaman the elfin youth stood listening with intense eagerness and expectation as the other went into the passage and by sundry kicks and bumps against wooden walls gave evidence that he found the channel intricate  presently a terrible kick occurred  this was the seamans toe against the step of which he had been warned but which he had totally forgotten then a softer but much heavier blow was heard accompanied by a savage growlthat was the seamans nose and forehead against old mrs robys portal  at this gillies expectations were realised and his joy consummated with mischievous glee sparkling in his eyes he hastened down to the court to exhibit his sixpence to his mother and to announce to all whom it might concern that the seacappn had run his jibboom slap through the old oomans cabindoor    chapter two  the seaman takes the cabin by surprise and storm  without having done precisely what gillie had asserted of him our seaman had in truth made his way into the presence of the little old woman who inhabited the cabin and stood there gazing round him as if lost in wonder and well he might be for the woman and cabin besides being extremely old were exceedingly curious quaint and small  the former was wrinkled to such an extent that you could not have found a patch of smooth skin large enough for a pea to rest on  her teeth were all gone back and front and her nose which was straight and wellformed made almost successful attempts to meet a chin which had once been dimpled but was now turned up  the mouth between them wore a benignant and a slightly humorous expression the eyes which were bright black and twinkling seemed to have defied the ravages of time her body was much bent as she sat in her chair and a pair of crutches leaning against the chimneypiece suggested the idea that it would not be much straighter if she stood up  she was wrapped in a large warm shawl and wore a high cap which fitted so close round her little visage that hair if any was undistinguishable  the room in which she sat resembled the cabin of a ship in more respects than one  it was particularly low in the root so low that the seamans hair touched it as he stood there looking round him and across this roof ran a great beam from which hung a variety of curious ornaments such as a chinese lantern a turkish scimitar a new zealand club an eastern shield and the model of a fullrigged ship  elsewhere on the walls were an ornamented dagger a worstedwork sampler a framed sheet of the flags of all nations a souwester cap and oiled coat a telescope and a small staring portrait of a seacaptain in his gotomeeting clothes which looked very much out of keeping with his staring sunburnt face and were a bad fit  it might have been a good likeness and was certainly the work of one who might have raised himself to the rank of a royal academician if he had possessed sufficient talent and who might have painted well if he had understood the principles of drawing and colour  the windows of the apartment of which there were two very small square ones looked out upon the river and to some extent overhung it so that a man of sanguine temperament might have enjoyed fishing from them if he could have been content to catch live rats and dead cats  the prospect from these windows was however the best of them being a wide reach of the noble river crowded with its stately craft and cut up by its everbustling steamers  but the most noteworthy part of this room or cabin was the space between the two windows immediately over the chimneypiece which the eccentric old woman had covered with a large and in some cases inappropriate assortment of objects by way of ornament each article being cleaned and polished to the highest possible condition of which it was susceptible  a group of five photographs of childrenthree girls and two boys looking amazed formed the centrepiece of the design around these were five other photographs of three young ladies and two young gentlemen looking conscious but pleased  the spaces between these and every available space around them were occupied by potlids of various sizes old and battered but shining like little suns small lookingglasses also of various sizes some square and others round little strings of beads heads of meerschaums that had been much used in former days pincushions shellbaskets one or two horseshoes and ironheels of boots several flat irons belonging to dolls houses with a couple of dolls much the worse for wear mounting guard over them besides a host of other nicknacks for which it were impossible to find names or imagine uses  everythingfrom the old womans cap to the uncarpeted floor and the little grate in which a little fire was making feeble efforts to warm a little teakettle with a defiant spoutwas scrupulously neat and fresh and clean very much the reverse of what one might have expected to find in connection with a povertystricken population a dirty lane a filthy court a rickety stair and a dark passage  possibly the cause might have been found in a large and muchworn family bible which lay on a small table in company with a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles at the old womans elbow  on this scene the nautical man stood gazing as we have said with much interest but he was too polite to gaze long  your servant missis he said with a somewhat clumsy bow  good morning sir said the little old woman returning the bow with the air of one who had once seen better society than that of grubbs court  your name is roby i believe continued the seaman advancing and looking so large in comparison with the little room that he seemed almost to fill it  the little old woman admitted that that was her name  my name said the seaman is wopper tho im oftener called skipper also cappn by those who know me  mrs roby pointed to a chair and begged captain wopper to sit down which he did after bestowing a somewhat pointed glance at the chair as if to make sure that it could bear him  you was a nuss once im told continued the seaman looking steadily at mrs roby as he sat down  i was answered the old woman glancing at the photographs over the chimneypiece in the same family for many years  youll excuse me maam continued the seaman if i appear something inquisitive i want to make sure that ive boarded the right craft dee seei mean that you are the right ooman  a look of surprise not unmingled with humour beamed from mrs robys twinkling black eyes as she gazed steadily in the seamans face but she made no other acknowledgment of his speech than a slight inclination of her head which caused her tall cap to quiver  captain wopper regarding this as a favourable sign went on  you was once maam im told before bein a nuss in the family of which youve made mention a matron or somethin o that sort in a foundlin hospitalin your young days maam  again mrs roby admitted the charge and demanded to know what then  ah jus sothats what im comin to said captain wopper drawing his large hand over his beard  you was present in that hospital maam was you not one dark november morning when a portercask was left at the door by some person unknown who cut his cable and cleared off before the door was openedwhich cask havin on its head two xs and bein labelled this side up with care contained two healthy little babby boys  mrs roby becoming suddenly grave and interested again said i was  jus so continued the captain you seem to be the right craftooman i meanthat im in search of  these two boys who were supposed to be brothers because of their each havin a brown mole of exactly the same size and shape on their left arms just below their elbows were named stout after the thing in which they was headed up the one bein christened james the other willum  yes yes replied the little old woman eagerly and a sweet lovely pair they was when the head of that barrel was took off lookin out of the straw in which they was packed like two little cheruphims though they did smell strong of the double x and was a little elevated because of the fumes that ung about the wood  but how do you come to know all this sir and why do you ask  excuse me maam replied the sailor with a smile which curled up his huge moustache expressivelyyou shall know presently but i must make quite sure that im aboard ofthat is to say that you are the right ooman  may i ask maam what became of these two cheruphims as youve very properly named em  certainly answered mrs roby the elder boywe considered him the elder because he was the first took out of the barrelwas a stoodious lad and clever  he got into a railway company i believe and became a rich manmarried a lady im toldand changed his name to stoutley so tis said not thinkin his right name suitable to his circumstances which to say truth it wasnt because he was very thin  ive heard it said that his family was extravagant and that he went to california to seek his brother and look after some property and died there but im not rightly sure for he was a close boy and latterly i lost all knowledge of him and his family  and the other cheruphim willum said the sailor what of him  ah exclaimed mrs roby a flush suffusing her wrinkled countenance while her black eyes twinkled more than usual he was a jewel he was  they said in the hospital that he was a wild goodfornothing boy but i never thought him so  he was always fond of mevery fond of me and i of him  it is true he could never settle to anythink and at last ran away to sea when about twelve year old but he didnt remain long at that either for when he got to california he left his ship and was not heard of for a long time after that  i thought he was dead or drowned but at last i got a letter from him enclosing money an saying he had been up at the noo golddiggings an had been lucky dear boy and he wanted to share his luck with me an would never never forget me but he didnt need to send me money to prove that  he has continued to send me a little every year since thenah its many many years noway ay many years  she sighed and looked wistfully at the spark of fire in the grate that was making ineffectual attempts to boil the little teakettle with the defiant spout but why she continued looking up suddenly why do you ask about him  because i knew him replied captain wopper searching for something which appeared to be lost in the depths of one of his capacious pockets willum stout was a chum of mine  we worked together at the californy goldmines for many a year as partners and when at last wed made what we thought enough we gave it up an came down to san francisco together an set up a hotel under the name of the jolly tars by stout and company  i was the company maam an for the matter o that i may say i was the stout too for both of us answered to the stout or the company accordin as we was addressed dee see  when company thought hed made enough money to entitle him to a holiday he came home as you see but before leavin willum said to him company my lad wen you get home youll go and see that old oom of the name of roby whom ive often told you about  she lives in lunun somewheres down by the river in a place called grubbs court  she was very good to me that old oom was when she was young as ive told you before  you go an give her my blessinwillums blessinand this here bag and that there letter  yes says i willum ill do it my boy as soon as ever i set futt on british soil  i did set futt on british soil this morning and theres the letter also the bag so you see old lady ive kep my promise  captain wopper concluded by placing a small but heavy canvas bag and a muchsoiled letter in mrs robys lap  to say that the little old woman seized the letter with eager delight would convey but a faint idea of her feelings as she opened it with trembling hands and read it with her bright black eyes  she read it half aloud mingled with commentary as she proceeded and once or twice came to a pause over an illegible word on which occasions her visitor helped her to the word without looking at the letter  this circumstance struck her at last as somewhat singular for she looked up suddenly and said you appear sir to be familiar with the contents of my letter  thats true maam replied captain wopper who had been regarding the old woman with a benignant smile willum read it to me before i left apurpose to enable me to translate the illmade pothooks and hangers because dee see we were more used to handlin the pick and shovel out there than the pen an willum used to say he never was much of a dab at a letter  he never wrote you very long ones maam i believe  mrs roby looked at the fire pensively and said in a low voice as if to herself rather than her visitor no they were not longnever very longbut always kind and sweet to mevery sweetay ay its a long long time now a long time since he came to me here and asked for a nights lodging  did you give it him maam asked the captain  give it him exclaimed mrs roby with sudden energy of course i did  the poor boy was nigh starving  how could i refuse him  it is true i had not much to give for the family i was with as nuss had failed and left me in great distress through my savings bein in their hands and thats what brought me to this little room long long agoay ay  but no blame to the family sir no blame at all  they couldnt help failin an the young ones when they grew up did not forget their old nuss though they aint rich far from it and its what they give me that enables me to pay my rent and stay on heregod bless em  she looked affectionately at the daguerreotypes which hung in the midst of the sheen and glory of potlids beads and lookingglasses above the chimneypiece  you gave him meanin willum nothing else i suppose asked the captain with a knowing look such for instance as a noo suit of clothes because of his bein so uncommon ragged that he looked as if he had bin captured in a clumsy sort of net that it would not have been difficult to break through and escape from naked also a few shillins bein your last to pay his way down to gravesend where the ship was lyin that you had through interest with the owners got him a berth aboard  ah returned mrs roby shaking her head and smiling gently i see that william has told you all about it  he has maam replied captain wopper with a decisive nod  you see out in the goldfields of californy we had long nights together in our tent with nothin to do but smoke our pipes eat our grub and spin yarns for we had no books nor papers nothin to read except a noo testament and we wouldnt have had even that maam but for yourself it was the testament you gave to willum at partin an very fond of it he was bein your gift  you see at the time we went to californy there warnt many of us as cared for the word of god  most of us was idolaters that had run away from home our chief godsfor we had many of embein named adventure excitement and gold though there was some noble exceptions too  but as i was saying we had so much time on our hands that we recalled all our past adventures together over and over again and you may be sure maam that your name and kindness was not forgotten  there was another name continued captain wopper drawing his chair nearer the fire crossing his legs and stroking his beard as he looked up at the dingy ceiling that willum often thought about and spoke of  it was the name of a gentleman a clerk in the customs i believe who saved his life one day when he fell into the river just below the bridge  mr lawrence said the old woman promptly  ah  mr lawrence yes thats the name continued the captain willum was very grateful to him and bid me try to find him out and tell him so  is he alive  dead said mrs roby shaking her head sadly  the seaman appeared much concerned on hearing this  for some time he did not speak and then said that he had been greatly interested in that gentleman through willums account of him  had he left any children  yes mrs roby told him one son who had been educated as a doctor and had become a sort of a city missionary and was as pleasant a young gentleman as she ever knew  so then you know him said the captain  know him  i should think so  why this is the district where he visits and a kind friend he is to the poor though he is bashful a bit an seems to shrink from pushin himself where hes not wanted  not the less a friend to the poor on that account thought captain wopper but he said nothing and mrs roby went on  you see his father before him did a great deal for the poor in a quiet way here as i have reason to know this district lying near his office and handy as it were  long after the time when he saved willums life he married a sweet young creeter who helped him in visitin the poor but she caught fever among em and died when their only son george was about ten year old  george had been goin about with his mother on her visits and seemed very fond of her and of the people dear child and after she died he used to continue coming with his father  then he went to school and college and became a young doctor and only last year he came back to us so changed for the better that none of us would have known him but for his kindly voice and fine manlylooking manner  his shyness too has stuck to him a little but it does not seem to hinder him now as it once did  ah continued mrs roby in a sympathetic tone its a great misfortune to be shy  she looked pensively at the little fire and shook her tall cap at it as if it or the defiant teakettle were answerable for something in reference to shyness  yes its a great misfortune to be shy she repeated  were you ever troubled with that complaint captain wopper  the captains moustache curled at the corners as he stroked his beard and said that really on consideration he was free to confess that he never had been convicted of that sin  mrs roby bestowed on him a look of admiration and continued well as i have said  she was interrupted at this point by the entrance of an active little girl with the dirtiest face and sweetest expression imaginable with garments excessively ragged blue eyes that sparkled as they looked at you a mouth that seemed made for kissing if only it had been clean and golden hair that would have fallen in clustering curls on her neck if it had not been allowed to twist itself into something like a yellow doormat which rendered a bonnet unnecessary  bestowing a glance of surprise on the seaman but without uttering a word she went smartly to a corner and drew into the middle of the room a round table with one leg and three feet whose accommodating top having been previously flat against the wall fell down horizontal and fixed itself with a snap  on this the earnest little woman quickly and neatly spread a fairish linen cloth and proceeded to arrange thereon a small teapot and cup and saucer with other materials for an early tea  two cups netta my dear said mrs roby  yes grannie replied netta in a soft quick little voice  your grandchild asked the captain  no a neighbours child who is very kind to me  she calls me grannie because i like it  but as i was saying continued mrs roby young dr lawrence came back last year and began to visit us in the old way intending to continue he said until he got a situation of some sort in the colonies i believe but i do hope hell not be obliged to leave us for he has bin a great blessin to this neighbourhood only he gets little pay for his work i fear and appears to have little of his own to live on poor young mannow captain wopper youll stop and have a cup of tea with me  i take it early you seein truth i make a sort of dinner of itand we can have a talk about william over it  im proud to have a friend of his at my table sir i do assure you though it is a poor one  captain wopper accepted the invitation heartily and thought though he said nothing that it was indeed a poor table seeing that the only food on it besides the very weak tea in the wonderfully small pot consisted of one small loaf of bread  netta exclaimed mrs roby with a look of surprise theres no butter  go fetch it dear  mrs roby was or thought herself a remarkably deep character  she spoke to netta openly but in secret bestowed a meaning glance on her and slipped a small coin into her hand  the dirty sweetfaced damsel replied by a remarkably knowing winkall of which byplay with the reason for it was as clear to captain wopper as if it had been elaborately explained to him  but the captain was a discreet man  he became deeply absorbed in daguerreotypes and saucepan lids above the fireplace to the exclusion of all else  youve forgotten the bag maam said the captain drawing his chair nearer the table  so i have dear me what is it cried mrs roby taking it up  its heavy  gold said the captain  gold exclaimed the old nurse  ay nuggets said the seaman opening it and emptying its contents on the table  as the old nurse gazed on the yellow heap her black eyes glittered with pleasure as though they had derived additional lustre from the precious metal and she drew them towards her with a trembling almost greedy motion at sight of which captain woppers countenance became troubled  and did willie send this to me dear boy  he did maam hoping that it would be of use in the way of making your home more comfortable and enabling you to keep a better table  he glanced uneasily round the poor room and at the small loaf as he spoke and the old woman observed the glance  it is very kind of him very kind continued mrs roby  what may it be worth now  forty pounds more or less answered the captain  again the old womans eyes sparkled greedily and again the seamans countenance fell  surely maam said the captain gravely things must be uncommon dear in london for you tell me that willum has sent you a deal of money in time past but you dont seem to be much the better for it  captain wopper said mrs roby putting her hand lightly on the captains arm as it lay on the table and looking earnestly into his face if you had not been an old and valued friend of my dear willie which i learn that you are from his letteri would have said your remark was a rude one but being what you are i dont mind telling you that i save up every penny i can scrape together for little netta white the girl that has just gone out to fetch the butter  although shes not well cared forowing to her mother whos a washerwoman bein overburdened with work and a drunken husbandshes one of the dearest creeters i ever did see  bless you sir youd be amazed if you knew all the kind and thoughtful things that untrained and uncared for child does and never thinks shes doing anything more than other people its all along of her mothers spirit which is as good as gold  some months ago little netta happened to be up here when i was at tea and seeing the difficulty i had to move about with my old rheumatic limbs she said shed come and set out my tea and breakfast for me and shes done it sir from that time to this expecting nothing fur it and thinking im too poor to give her anything  but shes mistaken continued mrs roby with a triumphant twinkle in her black eyes she doesnt know that ive made a confidant of her brother gillie and give him a sixpence now and then to give to his mother without telling where he got it and she doesnt know that im saving up to be able to leave something to her when im called homeit cant be long now it cant be long  old ooman cried captain wopper whose face had brightened wonderfully during this explanation give us your flipyour hand  i honour your heart maam and ive no respect whatever for your brain  im not sure that thats a compliment said mrs roby with a smile  captain wopper assured her with much solemnity that it might or might not be a compliment but it was a fact  why look here said he you go and starve yourself and deny yourself all sorts of little comforts what then  why youll die long before your time which is very like taking the law into your own hands maam and then you wont leave to netta nearly as much as you might if you had taken care of yourself and lived longer and saved up after a reasonable fashion  its sheer madness  why maam youre starving now but ill put a stop to that  dont you mind now whether im rude or not  you cant expect anything else from an old golddigger who has lived for years where there were no women except such as appeared to be made of mahogany with nothing to cover em but a coating of dirt and a blue skirt  besides willum told me at parting to look after you and see that you wanted for nothing which i promised faithfully to do  youve some regard for willums wishes maamyou wouldnt have me break my promises to willum would you  the captain said this with immense rapidity and vigour and finished it with such a blow of his heavy fist on the little table that the cups and plates danced and the lid of the little teapot leaped up as if its heart were about to come out of its mouth  mrs roby was so taken by surprise that she could not speak for a few seconds and before she had recovered sufficiently to do so little netta came in with the butter  now maam resumed the captain when the girl had retired heres where it is  with your leave ill reveal my plans to you and ask your advice  when i was about to leave californy willum told me first of all to go and find you out and give you that letter and bag of nuggets which ive done  then says he wopper you go and find out my brother jims widow and give em my love an dooty and this letter and this bag of nuggetssaid letter and bag maam bein now in my chest aboard ship  so says i willum i willtrust me  i do says he and wopper says he keep your weather eye open my boy wen you go to see em because ive my suspicions from what my poor brother said on his deathbed when he was wandering in his mind that his widow is extravagant  i dont know willum goes on to say what the son may be but theres that cousin emma gray that lives in the house with em shes all right  shes corresponded with me off an on since ever she could write and my brother bein something lazy poor fellar through havin too much to do i fancy got to throw all the letterwritin on her shoulders  you take special note of her wopper and if it should seem to you that they dont treat her well you let me know  willum says i i willtrust me  well then says willum theres one other individooal i want you to ferret out thats the gentlemanhe must be an old gentleman nowthat saved my life when i was a lad mr lawrence by name  you try to find him out and if you can do him a good turn do it  willum says i ill do ittrust me  i

good luck to you  dont forget my last will an testimony as now expressed  willum says i i wont  so maam i left californy with a sacred trust so to speak crossed the sea and here i am  at this point captain wopper having warmed in his subject took in at one bite as much of the small loaf as would have been rather a heavy dinner for mrs roby and emptied at one gulp a full cup of her tea after which he stroked his beard smiled benignantly at his hostess became suddenly earnest again and went onchewing as he spoke  now maam ive three questions to ask in the first place as its not possible now to do a good turn to old mr lawrence i must do it to his son  can you tell me where he lives  mrs roby told him that it was in a street not far from where they sat in a rather poor lodging  secondly maam can you tell me where willums sisterinlaw lives mrs stout alias stoutley  no captain wopper but i daresay mr lawrence can  he knows most everythink and has a london directory  good  now in the third place where am i to find a lodging  mrs roby replied that there were plenty to be found in london of all kinds  you havent a spare room here have you said the captain looking round  mrs roby shook her head and said that she had not and besides that if she had it would be impossible for her to keep a lodger as she had no servant and could not attend on him herself  mrs roby said the captain a golddigging seaman dont want no servant nor no attendance  whats up aloft  by pointing to a small trapdoor in the ceiling he rendered the question intelligible  its a garret i believe replied mrs roby smiling but having no ladder ive never been up  youve no objection to my taking a look have you asked the captain  none in the world replied the old woman  without more ado the seaman rose mounted on a chair pushed open the trapdoor thrust his head and shoulders through and looked round  apparently the inspection was not deemed sufficiently close for to the old womans alarm and inexpressible surprise he seized the edges of the hole with his strong hands raised himself up and finally disappeared in the regions above the alarm of the old woman was somewhat increased by the sound of her visitors heavy tread on the boards overhead as he stumbled about presently his head appeared looking down through the trap  in any aspect captain woppers shaggy head was an impressive one but viewed in an upsidedown position with the blood running into it it was peculiarly striking  i say old lady he shouted as if his position recalled the action and induced the tones of a boatswain itll do  a capital berth with two portholes and a bunk  the captains head disappeared and immediately his legs took its place suggesting the outrageous idea that he had thrown a somersault  next moment his huge body slid down and he stood on the floor much flushed and covered with dust  now old girl is it to be he said sitting down at the table  will you take me as a lodger for better and for worse  ill fit up the berth on the maindeck and be my own servant as well as yours  say the word  i can refuse nothing to willies friend said old mrs roby but really i  done its a bargain interrupted the captain rising abruptly  now ill go visit young mr lawrence and mrs stoutley and tomorrow ill bring my kit take possession of my berth and you and i shall sail in company i hope and be messmates for some time to come    chapter three  difficulties among the social summits  in one of the many mansions of the west end of london a lady reclined one morning on a sofa wishing that it were afternoon  she was a middleaged handsome sickly lady  if it had been afternoon she would have wished that it were evening and if it had been evening she would have wished for the morning for mrs stoutley was one of those languid invalids whose enjoyment appears to be altogether in the future or the past and who seem to have no particular duties connected with the present except sighing and wishing  it may be that this unfortunate condition of mind had something to do with mrs stoutleys feeble state of health  if she had been a little more thoughtful about others and less mindful of herself she might perhaps have sighed and wished less and enjoyed herself more  at all events her doctor seemed to entertain some such opinion for sitting in an easy chair beside her and looking earnestly at her handsome wornout countenance he said somewhat abruptly being a blunt doctor  you must go abroad madam and try to get your mind as well as your body well shaken up  why doctor replied mrs stoutley with a faint smile you talk of me as if i were a bottle of physic or flat gingerbeer  you are little better silly woman thought the doctor but his innate sense of propriety induced him only to say with a smile well there is at least this much resemblance between you and a bottle of flat gingerbeer namely that both require to be made to effervesce a little  it will never do to let your spirits down as you have been doing  we must brighten up my dear madamnot brighton up by the way weve had enough of brighton and bath and such places  we must get away to the continent this summerto the pyrenees or switzerland where we can breathe the fresh mountain air and ramble on glaciers and have a thorough change  mrs stoutley looked gently almost pitifully at the doctor while he spoke as if she thought him a wellmeaning and impulsive but rather stupid maniac  impossible my dear doctor she said you know i could not stand the fatigues of such a journey  well then replied the doctor abruptly you must stop at home and die  oh what a shocking naughty man you are to talk so  mrs stoutley said this however with an easy goodnatured air which showed plainly that she did not believe her illness likely to have such a serious termination  i will be still more naughty and shocking continued the doctor resolutely but with a twinkle in his eyes for i shall prescribe not only a dose of mountain air but a dose of mountain exercise to be takenand the patient to be well shaken while takenevery morning throughout the summer and autumn  moreover after you return to england you must continue the exercise during the winter and in addition to that must have an object at the end of your walks and drivesnot shopping observe that is not a sufficiently outofdoor object nor visiting your friends which is open to the same objection  mrs stoutley smiled again at this and said that really if visiting and shopping were forbidden there seemed to be nothing left but museums and picturegalleries  to this the doctor retorted that although she might do worse than visit museums and picturegalleries he would prefer that she should visit the diamond and gold fields of the city  did you ever hear of the diamond and gold fields of london miss gray he said turning to a plain yet pretty girl who had been listening in silence to the foregoing conversation  never answered miss gray with a look of surprise  now miss grays look of surprise induces us to state in passing that this young ladyniece also poor relation and companion to mrs stoutleypossessed three distinct aspects  when grave she was plainnot ugly observe a girl of nineteen with a clear healthy complexion and nutbrown hair cannot in any circumstances be ugly no she was merely plain when grave  when she smiled she was decidedly pretty and when she laughed she was captivatingabsolutely irresistible  she seldom laughed occasionally smiled and was generally grave  there was something quite incomprehensible about her for she was not an unusually good girl and by no means a dashing girl neither was she an intensely modest girland yet plain emma gray had perhaps driven more young men into a condition of drivelling imbecility than any acknowledged beauty of the metropolis  observe we say perhaps because we lay claim to no superhuman knowledge in regard to such matters  they are rather extensive fields continued the doctor scattered here and there about the metropolis but lying chiefly in the city and on the banks of the thames  they comprise many picturegalleries too and museums the latter containing wonderful specimens of old bones and fossil remains filth and miscellaneous abominations in which the gold and diamonds are imbeddedsometimes buriedand the former being hung with subjectschiefly interiorsincomparably superior in respect of graphic power to the works of hogarth  oh  i know what you mean said miss gray with a little smile  your wits are sharper than mine emma said mrs stoutley with a sigh and a placid look  what do you refer to doctor tough  i refer to those districts madam chiefly inhabited by the poor where there are innumerable diamonds and gold nuggets some of which are being polished and a good many are glittering brightly though not yet fixed in their proper setting while by far the greater number of them are down in the earth and useless in the meantime and apt to be lost for want of adventurous diggers  they are splendid fields those of london and digging is healthful occupationthough it might not seem so at first sight  did you ever visit the poor mrs stoutley  with a slight elevation of her eyebrows and the application of a scentbottle to her delicate nose as if the question had suggested bad smells the lady said thatwell yes she had once visited a poor old gardener who had been a faithful creature in the family of a former friend but that her recollection of that visit did not tend to induce a wish for its repetition  hm coughed the doctor well the taste of physic is usually bad at first but one soon gets used to it and the after effects as you know are exceedingly beneficial  i hope that when you visit the london diggings you may find the truth of this but it will be time enough to speak of that subject when you return from rambling on the glaciers of switzerland where by the way the dirt rubbish and wrack called moraines which lie at the foot of the glaciers will serve to remind you of the goldfields to which i have referred for much of what composes those moraines was once solid rock in a fixed position on the heights or glittering ice which reflected the suns dazzling rays on surrounding high life though it lies low in the earth now  to a lady of your intelligence madam i need not expound my parable  there are many avalanches great and small in english society as well as among the swiss mountains and whether by gradual subsidence or a tremendous rush we must all find our places in the moraine at last  really doctor said mrs stoutley with a light laugh you seem to have already wandered much among these moral moraines and to have acquired some of their ruggedness  how can you talk of such dismal things to a patient  but are you really in earnest about my going abroad  indeed i am replied the doctor firmly and i advise you to begin your preparations at once for you must set out on your travels in less than a month  i lay the responsibility of seeing my orders carried into effect on your shoulders miss gray  so saying the doctor rose and took his leave  mrs stoutley and her niece immediately began to discuss the subject of switzerlandthe one languidly the other with animation  it was plain enough that although the invalid protested to the doctor her inability to travel she really had no objection perhaps felt some desire to go abroad for when miss gray mentioned the fact that there was a difficulty in the shape of insufficient funds she replied with more warmth than usual  now emma what is the use of always bringing up that ridiculous idea  no doubt auntie the maiden replied it is a little ridiculous to run short of ready money considering the style in which we live but it would be still more ridiculous you know to go to switzerland without the means of paying our expenses while there  whats that you say about expenses cousin exclaimed a tall handsome stripling who entered at the moment and seated himself on the sofa at his mothers feet  oh bother the expense he exclaimed when the difficulty had been explained to him it cant cost so much to spend a few months in switzerlandbesides we can do it cheap you know  didnt mr whatshisname our man of business say that there was a considerable balance at the bankers and that if the whatdeecallem mines paid a reasonable dividend we should easily get over our difficulties  he said something of that sort i believe replied mrs stoutley with a sigh  i rather think cousin lewis said emma endeavouring to repress a smile that he said there was an inconsiderable balance at the bankers and that unless the gorong mine paid a reasonable dividend we shouldnt easily get over our difficulties  both lewis and his mother laughed at the quiet way in which this was said but while both admitted that emmas view of the matter might perhaps be correct lewis held that there was no good reason for supposing there would be any difficulty in the meantime in obtaining from their manofbusiness the paltry sum that was required for a short tour on the continent  indeed mrs stoutley regarded this manofbusiness as a mere sponge who required only to be squeezed in order to the production of what was desired and the manofbusiness himself found it no easy matter to convince her that she held erroneous views on this subject and that at her present rate of progress she would to use the doctors glacial simile very soon topple from the pinnacle of fashion on which she sat and fall with the crash of a social avalanche into the moraine of ruin  what a wise little woman you are cousin emma said lewis gaily you ought to have been bred to the law or trained an accountant however we wont be guided by your advice just now first because the doctor has ordered mother abroad for her health which is our chief consideration and second because i wish of all things to see switzerland and climb mont blanc  besides we are not so poor as you think and i hope to add a little to our general funds in a day or two by the way can you lend me ten pounds just now mother  why do you want it asked mrs stoutley sternly as if she meant to refuse but at the same time opening her purse  dont ask me just now  i will repay you tomorrow with interest and shall then explain  with an easy languid smile the carelessly amiable invalid handed her last tenpound note to her hopeful son who had just transferred it to his pocketbook when a footman entered and presented a scrap of dirty paper informing his lady that the person who sent up the card desired to see her  what is this said mrs stoutley holding the paper gingerly with the tips of her fingers wipwapwopper  what is wopper  is the person a man or a woman  the footman who although wellbred found it difficult to restrain a smile intimated that the person was a man and added that he said he had come from california and wanted to see mrs stoutley very particularly  on hearing this the ladys manner changed at once and with more animation than she had yet exhibited she desired that he should be shown in  with his large wideawake in one hand and a canvas bag in the other captain wopper entered the drawingroom and looked around him with a beaming and rather bashful smile  mrs stoutley i believe he said advancing and miss emma gray i suppose he added turning with a beaming glance towards the young lady  mrs stoutley admitted that he was right and expressed some surprise that he a perfect stranger should be so well acquainted with their names  i am indeed a stranger personally maam said captain wopper smoothing the hair down on his rugged brow but i may be said to know you pretty well seeing that i have for many years been the friend and messmate of your late husbands brother in californy  indeed exclaimed mrs stoutley with increasing animation as she rose and held out her hand any friend of my brotherinlaw is heartily welcome  be seated mr wopper and let me hear about him  he was very kind to my dear husband during his last illnessvery kind  i shall never forget him  no doubt he was said the captain accepting the chair which emma gray handed to him with looks of great interest  thank ee miss  willum stoutexcuse my familiarity maam i always called him willum because we was like brothersmore than brothers i may say an very friendly yes willum stout was kind to his brother in his last days  it would have bin shame to him if he hadnt for your husband maam was kind to willum an he often said to me over the campfires in the bush that hed never forget his kindness  but its over now continued the seaman in a sad tone an poor willum is left alone  is my uncle very poor asked lewis who had been paying more attention to the appearance of their rugged visitor than to what he had said  ay very poor replied the seaman as regards near relations leastwise such as he has seen and known in former days but he ant poor as regards gold  hes got lots of that  he and i worked not far from each other for years an he used to hit upon good claims somehow and shovelled up the nuggets like stones  indeed  i wish hed send a few of them this way exclaimed lewis with a careless laugh  no doubt he might do so young man if he knew you were in need of em but your father gave him to understand that his family was rich  rich exclaimed lewis with a smile in which there was a touch of contempt  well yes we were rich enough once but when my father was away these wretched mines became  lewie exclaimed his mother hastily what nonsense you do talk really one would think from your account that we were paupers  well mother so we arepaupers to this extent at least that we cant afford to take a run to switzerland though ordered to do so for your health because we lack funds  lewis said this half petulantly for he had been a spoilt child and might probably have been by that time a ruined young man but for the mercy of his creator who had blessed him with an amiable disposition he was one of those youths in short of whom people say that they cant be spoiled though fond and foolish parents do their best to spoil them  you misstate the case naughty boy said mrs stoutley annoyed at being thus forced to touch on her private affairs before a stranger no doubt our ready cash is what our manofbusiness calls locked up but that you know is only a matter of temporary inconvenience and cannot last long  as mrs stoutley paused and hesitated their visitor placed on the table a canvas bag which up to this point he had rested on one knee  this bag he said of nuggets is a gift from willum  he desired me to deliver it to you miss gray as a small acknowledgment of your kindness in writin so often to him  hed have bought you a silk gown or a noo bonnet so he said but wasnt sure as to your taste in such matters and thought youd accept the nuggets and buy it for yourself leastwise thats somethin like the speech willum tried to tell me to deliver but he warnt good at speechmakin no more than i at remembrin and hoped youd take the will for the deed  with a flush of surprise and pleasure emma gray accepted both the will and the deed with many expressions of gratitude and said that as she did not require either a silk dress or a bonnet just then she would invest her little fortune she would lend it at high interest to a lady under temporary inconvenience who was ordered by her doctor to switzerland for the benefit of her health  to this mrs stoutley protested very earnestly that the lady in question would not accept the loan on any consideration that it must not be diverted from its destined use but be honestly expended on silkdresses and new bonnets to which emma replied that the destiny of the gift with interest she was very particular on that head should be fulfilled in good time but that meanwhile it must be lent out  in the midst of a crossfire of this kind the bag was opened and its contents poured on the table to the immense admiration of all the company none of whom had until that day beheld gold in its native condition  how much may it be worth mr wopper asked lewis weighing one of the largest lumps  about two hundred pound i should say more or less replied the seaman  indeed exclaimed the youth in surprisean exclamation which was echoed by his mother and cousin in modified tones  while they sat thus toying with the lumps of gold the conversation reverted to the sender of it and the captain told such entertaining anecdotes of bush life in all of which uncle willum had been an actor that the afternoon arrived before mrs stoutley had time to wish for it  they also talked of the last illness of the deceased father of the family and when it came out that captain they had found out by that time that their visitor had been a skipper and by courtesy a captain had assisted willum in nursing mr stoutley and had followed him to the grave mrs stoutleys gratitude was such that she insisted on her visitor staying to dinner  thank ee maam he said ive dined  i always dines at one oclock if i can manage it  but we dont dine till eight said the lady so it will just suit for your supper  do come said emma gray we shall be quite alone and shall have a great spinning of yarns over uncle william and the goldfields  well i dont mind if i do said the captain but before supper i must go to the docks for my kit and settle my lodgings  i am going to the strand and shall be happy to give you a lift said lewis  the captain accepted the offer and as they drove along he and his young friend became very intimate insomuch that lewis who was lighthearted open and reckless let him into his confidence and spoke quite freely about his mothers difficulties  it is only justice to add that the captain did not encourage him in this  when however the youth spoke of himself he not only encouraged him but drew him out among other things he drew out of him the fact that he was in the habit of gambling and that he fully expectedif his usual luck attended himto assist in adding to the fund which was to take the family abroad  the captain looked at the handsome stripling for a few seconds in silent surprise  you dont mean to tell me he said slowly that you gamble  indeed i do replied lewis with a bland smile and something of a twinkle in his eye  for money asked the captain  for money assented the youth what have you to say against it  why ive to say that its mean  thats strong language said lewis flushing  it ant strong enough by a long way returned the captain with indignation its more than mean its contemptible its despicable  the flush on lewiss face deepened and he looked at his companion with the air of one who meditates knocking another down  perhaps the massive size and strength of the captain induced him to change his mind  it may be that there occurred to him the difficultyif not impossibilityof knocking down a man who was down already and the want of space in a cab for such violent play of muscle  at all events he did nothing but looked daggers  look ee here my lad continued the captain laying his huge hand on his companions knee and gazing earnestly into his face i dont mean for to hurt your feelins by sayin that you are mean or contemptible or despicable for i dont suppose youve thought much about the matter at all and are just following in the wake of older men who ought to know better but i say that the thinggambling for moneyis the meanest thing a man can do short of stealing  what does it amount to  simply thisi want another mans money and the other man wants mine  we darent try open robbery we would be ashamed of that were both too lazy to labour for money and labour doesnt bring it in fast enough therefore well go play for it  ill ask him to submit to be robbed by me on condition that i submit to be robbed by him and which is to be the robbed and which the robber shall depend on the accidental turn of a dice or something equally trifling  but i dont gamble by means of dice interrupted lewis i play and bet on billiards which is a game of skill requiring much practice judgment and thought  that makes no odds my lad continued the captain  there is no connection whatever between the rolling of a ball and the taking away of a mans money any more than there is between the turning of a dice and the taking of a mans money  both are dishonourable subterfuges  they are mere blinds put up to cover the great and mean fact which is that i want to get possession of my neighbours cash  but captain retorted lewis with a smilefor he had now entered into the spirit of the argumentyou ignore the fact that while i try to win from my friend i am quite willing that my friend should try to win from me  ignore it no cried captain wopper  putt it in this way  isnt it wrong for me to have a longing desire and itching fingers to lay hold of your cash  well put in that simple form said lewis with a laugh it certainly is  and isnt it equally wrong for you to have a hungering and thirsting after my cash  of course that follows assented lewis  well then pursued the captain can any agreement between you and me as to the guessing of black or white or the turning of dice or anything else make a right out of two wrongs  still said lewis a little puzzled there is fallacy somewhere in your argument  i cannot see that gambling is wrong  mark me my lad returned the captain impressively it is no sufficient reason for the doing of a thing that you cannot see it to be wrong  you are not entitled to do anything unless you see it to be right  but there are other questions connected with gambling which renders it doubly meanthe question for instance whether a man is entitled to risk the loss of money which he calls his own but which belongs to his wife and children as much as to himself  the mean positions too in which a gambler places himself are numerous  one of these is when a rich man wins the hardearned and muchneeded gains of a poor one  but one is not supposed to know anything about the affairs of those from whom one wins objected lewis  all the more reason replied captain wopper why a man should never gamble lest unwittingly he should become the cause of great sufferingit might be of death  still lewis could not see the wrong of gambling and the discussion was cut short by the sudden stopping of the cab at a door in the strand over which hung a lamp on which the captain observed the word billiards  well tata old fellow said lewis gaily as he parted from his new friend well finish the argument another day  meanwhile dont forget the houreight sharp    chapter four  shows how the captain came to an anchor and conceived a deep design  when captain wopper parted from his young friend he proceeded along the strand in an unusually grave mood shaking his head to such a degree as he reflected on the precocious wickedness of the rising generation that a very ragged and pert specimen of that generation observing his condition gravely informed him that there was an hospital for incurables in london which took in patients with palsy and st wituses dance werry cheap  this recalled him from the depths of sorrowful meditation and induced him to hail a cab in which he drove to the docks claimed his chesta solid seamanlike structure reminding one of the wooden walls of old englandand returned with it to the head of the lane leading to grubbs court  dismissing the cab he looked round for a porter but as no porter appeared the captain having been accustomed through life to help himself and being as we have said remarkably strong shouldered the nautical chest and bore it to the top of mrs robys staircase  here he encountered and almost tumbled over gillie white who saluted him with  hallo ship ahoooy starboard hard breakers ahead  why cappn youve all but run into me  why dont you show a light then retorted the captain or blow your steamwhistle in such a dark hole  whats that youve got in your arms  the baby replied gillie  what baby demanded the captain  our baby of course returned the imp in a tone that implied the nonexistence of any other baby worth mentioning  i brought it up to show it to the sick ooman next door but one to mrs robys cabin shes very sick she is an took a great longing to see our baby cos she thinks its like what her son was wen he was a baby  if he ever was he dont look much like one now for hes sixfeet nothin in his socks an drinks like a fish if he dont do nothin wuss  goodnight cappn  babyll ketch cold if i keep on jawin here  mind your weather eye and port your helm when you reach the landin  if youll take the advice of a young salt youll clew up your mainsail an dowse some of your tophamperah  i thought so  this last remark delivered with a broad grin of delight had reference to the fact that the captain had run the corner of his chest against the low roof of the passage with a degree of violence that shook the whole tenement  holding his breath in hopeful anticipation and reckless of the babys ketching cold the small boy listened for more  nor was he disappointed  in his progress along the passage captain wopper despite careful steering ran violently foul of several angles and beams each of which mishaps sent a quiver through the old house and a thrill to the heart of gillie white  in his earnest desire to steer clear of the sick womans door the luckless captain came into collision with the opposite wall and anxiety on this point causing him to forget the step on which he had struck once before he struck it again and was precipitated chest and all against mrs robys door which fortunately for itself burst open and let the avalanche of chest and man descend upon mrs robys floor  knowing that the climax was now reached the imp descended the stair filled with a sort of serene ecstasy while captain wopper gathered himself up and sat down on his nautical portmanteau  i tell ee what it is old ooman said he stroking his beard the channel into this port is about the wust i ever had the illluck to navigate  i hope i didnt frighten ee  oh dear no replied mrs roby with a smile  to say truth the old woman seemed less alarmed than might have been expected  probably the noise of the captains approach and previous experience had prepared her for some startling visitation for she was quite calm and a humorous twinkle in her eyes seemed to indicate the presence of a spirit somewhat resembling that which actuated gillie white  well thats all right said the captain rising and pushing up the trapdoor that led to his private berth in the new lodging and now old lady havin come to an anchor i must get this chest sent aloft as fast as i can seein that ive to clean myself an rig out for a dinner at eight oclock at the west end  dear me said mrs roby in surprise you must have got among people of quality  it wont be easy to hoist it up said the captain ignoring the remark and eyeing the chest and trapdoor in the roof alternately  just then a heavy step was heard in the passage and a young man of large and powerful frame with a gentle as well as gentlemanly demeanour appeared at the door  come income in said mrs roby with a bright look this is only my new lodger a friend of dear wil  why bless you old ooman interrupted captain wopper he knows me well enough  i went to him this morning and got mrs stoutleys address  come in dr lawrence  i may claim to act the host here now in a small way perhaps and bid visitors welcomeeh  mrs roby  surely surely replied the old woman  thank you both for the welcome said the visitor with a pleasant smile as he shook hands with mrs roby  i thought i recognised your voice captain wopper as you passed mrs levens door and came out to see how you and my old friend here get on together  is she any better tonight sir asked mrs roby anxiously  lawrence shook his head sadly and said she was no better and that he feared she had little chance of getting better while her dissipated son dwelt under the same roof with her  it is breaking her heart he added and besides that the nature of her disease is such that recovery is impossible unless she is fed on the most generous diet this of course she cannot have because she has no means of her own her son gambles away nearly all his small salary and she refuses to go to an hospital lest her absence should be the removal of the last restraining link between him and destruction  it is a very sad case very  captain wopper was struck with this reference to gambling coming so soon after his recent conversation on that subject and asked if there were no charitable societies or charitable people in london who would help in a case so miserable  yes there were plenty of charitable institutions lawrence told him but he feared that this woman had no special claim on any of them and her refusal to go to an hospital would tell against her  there were also he said plenty of charitable people but all of those he happened to be acquainted with had been appealed to by him so often that he felt ashamed to try them again  he had already given away as much of his own slender means as he could well spare so that he saw no way out of the difficulty but he had faith in providential supervision of human affairs and he believed that a way would yet be opened up  youre right sirright said captain wopper with emphasis while he looked earnestly into the face of the young doctor  this world wasnt made to be kicked about like a football by chance or circumstances or anything of the sort  look ee here sir it has bin putt into my heart to feel charitable leanings and a good bit o cash has bin putt into my pocket so that bein a lone sort o man i dont have much use for it thats on the one hand  on the other hand here are you sir the son of a friend o my chum willum stout with great need of aid from charitable people an here we two are met togetherboth ready for action  now i call that a providential arrangement so please putt me down as one of your charitable friends  its little i can boast of in that way as yet but its not too late to begin  ive long arrears to pull up so ill give you that to begin with  itll help to relieve mrs leven in the meantime  as he spoke the captain drew a black pocketbook from his breast pocket and taking a piece of paper therefrom placed it in the doctors hands  this is a fiftypound note said lawrence in surprise  well what then returned the captain  you didnt expect a thousandpound note did you  not quite that replied lawrence laughing but i thought that perhaps you had made a mistake  ah you judged from appearances young man  dont you git into the way of doin that else youll be for ever sailin on the wrong tack  take my advice an never look as if you thought a man gave you more than he could afford  nobody never does that  far be it from me returned lawrence to throw cold water on generous impulses  i accept your gift with thanks and will gladly put you on my list  if you should find hereafter that i pump you rather hard please to remember that you gave me encouragement to do so  pump away sir  when youve pumped dry ill tell you  well said lawrence rising ill go at once and bring your liberality into play and since you have done me so good a turn remember that you may command my services if they can ever be of any use to you  the captain cast a glance at the trapdoor and the chest  well said he i can scarcely ask you to do it professionally but if youd lend a hand to get this noahs ark o mine on to the upper deck id  come along cried lawrence jumping up with a laugh and seizing one end of the ark  captain wopper grasped the other end and between them with much puffing pushing and squeezing they thrust the box through the trap to the upper regions whither the captain followed it by means of the same gymnastic feat that he performed on his first ascent  thrusting his head down he invited the doctor to come aloft which the doctor did in the same undignified fashion for his gentle manner and spirit had not debarred him from the practice and enjoyment of manly exercises  its a snug berth you see said the captain stumbling among the dusty lumber and knocking his head against the beams wants cleaning up tho and puttin to rights a bit but ill soon manage that and when i git the dirt and cobwebs cleared away glass putt in the portholes and a whitewash on the roof and walls itll be a cabin fit for an admiral  see what a splendid view of the river  just suited to a seafarin man  capital cried lawrence going down on his knees to obtain the view referred to  rather low in the roof however dont you think  low not at all exclaimed the captain  its nothin to what ive been used to on the coastin trade off californy  why ive had to live in cabins so small that a tall man couldnt keep his back straight when he was sittin on the lockers but we didnt sit much in em we was chiefly used to go into em to lie down  this is a palace to such cabins  the doctor expressed satisfaction at finding that his new charitable contributor took such enlarged views of a pigeonhole and promising to pay him another visit when the cabin should have been put to rights said goodbye and went to relieve the wants of the sick woman  as the captain accompanied him along the passage they heard the voice and step of poor mrs levens dissipated son as he came stumbling and singing up the stair  he was a stout goodlooking youth and cast a half impudent half supercilious look at captain wopper on approaching  he also bestowed a nod of careless recognition on dr lawrence  thinking it better to be out of the way the captain said goodbye again to his friend and returned to the cabin where he expressed to mrs roby the opinion that that young feller leven was goin to the dogs at railway speed  thereafter he went aloft and as he expressed it rigged himself out in a spruce blue coat with brass buttons blue vest and trousers to match a white dicky with a collar attached and imitation carbuncle studs down the front  to these he added a black silk neckerchief tied in a true sailors knot but with the ends separated and carefully tucked away under his vest to prevent their interfering with the effulgence of the carbuncle studs a pair of light shoes with a superabundance of new tie a green silk handkerchief to be carried in his hat for the purpose of mopping his forehead when warm and a red silk ditto to be carried in his pocket for the benefit of his nose  in addition to the studs captain wopper wore as ornaments a solid gold ring the rude workmanship of which induced the belief that he must have made it himself and a large gold watch with a gold chain in the form of a cable and a rough gold nugget attached to it in place of a seal or key we class the watch among simple ornaments because although it went very demonstratively too with a loud selfasserting tickits going was irregular and uncertain  sometimes it went too slow without apparent cause  at other times it went too fast without provocation  frequently it struck altogether and only consented to resume work after a good deal of gentle and persuasive threatening to wind it the wrong way  it had chronic internal complaints too which produced sundry ominous clicks and sounds at certain periods of the day  these passed off however towards evening  occasionally such sounds rushed as it were into a sudden whirr and series of convulsions ending in a dead stop which was an unmistakeable intimation to the captain that something vital had given way that the watch had gone into open mutiny and nothing short of a visit to the watchmaker could restore it to life and duty  im off now said the captain descending when he was fully rigged what about the doorkey motheryouve no objection to my calling you mother have you  none whatever captain replied mrs roby with a pleasant smile an old friend of william may call me whatever he pleasesshort she added after momentary pause of swearin  trust me ill stop short of that  you see old lady i never knowd a mother and i should like to try to feel what its like to have one its true im not just a lad but you are old enough to be my mother for all that so ill make the experiment  but what about the key of the door mother  i cant expect you to let me in you know  just lock it and take the key away with you said mrs roby  but what if a fire should break out said the captain with a look of indecision  im not afraid of fire  weve got a splendid brigade and plenty of fireescapes and a good kick from a fireman would open my door without a key  mother youre a trump  ill lock you in and leave you with an easy mind  he stopped abruptly and mrs roby asked what was the matter  well its what i said about an easy mind that threw me all aback replied the captain for to tell ee the truth i havent got an easy mind  not done anything wicked i hope said mrs roby anxiously  no no nothin o that sort but there is somethin lyin heavy on my mind and i dont see why i shouldnt make a confidant o you bein my mother dee see and besides it consarns willum  the old woman looked eagerly at her lodger as he knitted his brows in perplexity and smoothed down his forelock  heres where it is he continued drawing his chair closer to that of mrs roby when willum made me his exikooter so to speak he said to me wopper says he im not one o them fellers that holds on to his cash till he dies with it in his pocket  ive got neither wife nor chick as you know an so wot i means to do is to give the bulk of it to them that i love while im alivedee see  i do willum says i well then says he besides them little matters that i axed you to do for me i want you to take partikler notice of two people  one is the man as saved my life wen i was a youngster or if hes dead take notice of his childn  the other is that sweet young creeter emma gray who has done the correspondence with me so long for my poor brother  you keep a sharp lookout an find out how these two are off for money  if emmas rich of course its no use to give her what she dont need and ill give the most of what ive had the good fortune to dig up here to old mr lawrence or his family for my brothers widow bein rich dont need it  if both emma and lawrence are rich why then just let me know and ill try to hit on some other plan to make away with it for you know well enough i couldnt use it all upon myself without going into wicked extravagance and my dear old mrs roby wouldnt know what to do with so much cash if i sent it to her  now you promise to do this for me says he  willum says i i do  now mother continued the captain what troubles me is this that instead o findin miss emma rich and mr lawrence poor or wice wersa or findin em both rich i finds em both poor  thats where my difficulty lies  mrs roby offered a prompt solution of this difficulty by suggesting that william should divide the money between them  that would do all well enough returned the captain if there were no undercurrents drivin the ship out of her true course  but you see mother i find that the late mr stoutleys family is also poorat least in difficultiesalthough they live in great style and seem to be rich and from what i heard the other day i know that the son is given to gamblin and the mother seems to be extravagant and both of em are ready enough to sponge on miss emma who is quite willinfar too willinto be sponged upon so that whatever willum gave to her would be just thrown away  now the question is continued the captain looking seriously at the kettle with the defiant spout what am i to advise willum to do  advise him replied mrs roby promptly to give all the money to dr lawrence and get dr lawrence to marry miss gray and so theyll both get the whole of it  a beaming smile crossed the captains visage  not a bad notion mother but what if dr lawrence after gettin the money didnt want to marry miss gray  get him to marry her first and give the money afterwards returned mrs roby  ay that might do replied the captain nodding slowly only it may be that a man without means may hesitate about marryin a girl without means especially if he didnt want her and she didnt want him  i dont quite see how to get over all these difficulties  theres only one way of getting over them said mrs roby and that is by bringin the young people together and givin em a chance to fall in love  true true mother but so far as i know dr lawrence dont know the family  we couldnt said the captain looking round the room dubiously ask em to take a quiet cup of tea here with useh  you might ask dr lawrence as your medical man and i might ask miss emma as an old friend of her uncle quite in an offhand way you know as if by chance  theyd never see through the dodge and would fall in love at once perhapseh  captain wopper said all this in a dubious tone looking at the defiant kettle the while as if propitiating its favourable reception of the idea but it continued defiant and hissed uncompromisingly while its mistress laughed outright  youre not much of a matchmaker i see she said on recovering composure  no captain it wouldnt do to ask em here to tea  well well said the captain rising well let matchmakin alone for the present  its like tryin to beat to windard against a cyclone  the best way is to square the yards furl the sails and scud under bare poles till its over  its blowin too hard just now for me to make headway so ill wear ship and scud  in pursuance of this resolve captain wopper put on his wideawake locked up his mother and went off to dine at the west end    chapter five  in which several important matters are arranged and gillie white undergoes some remarkable and hitherto unknown experiences  it is not necessary to inflict on the reader mrs stoutleys dinner in detail suffice it to say that captain wopper conducted himself on the whole much more creditably than his hostess had anticipated and made himself so entertaining especially to lewis that that young gentleman invited him to accompany the family to switzerland much to the amusement of his cousin emma and the horror of his mother who although she enjoyed a private visit of the captain did not relish the thought of his becoming a travelling companion of the family  she pretended not to hear the invitation given but when lewis knowing full well the state of her mind pressed the invitation she shook her head at him covertly and frowned  this byplay her son pretended not to see and continued his entreaties the captain not having replied  now do come with us captain wopper he said it will be such fun and we should all enjoy you so muchwouldnt we emma  yes indeed from emma and it would just be suited to your tastes and habits for the fine fresh air of the mountains bears a wonderful resemblance to that of the sea  youve been accustomed no doubt to climb up the shrouds to the crosstrees well in switzerland you may climb up the hills to any sort of trees you like and get shrouded in mist or tumble over a precipice and get put into your shroud altogether and  really lewie you ought to be ashamed of making such bad puns interrupted his mother  doubtless it would be very agreeable to have captain wopper with us but i am quite sure it would be anything but pleasant for him to travel through such a wild country with such a wild goose as you for a companion  you have modestly forgotten yourself and emma said lewis but come let the captain answer for himself  you know mother it has been your wish if not your intention to get a companion for me on this tripa fellow older than myselfa sort of travelling tutor who could teach me something of the geology and botany of the country as we went along well the captain is older than me i think which is one of the requisites and he could teach me astronomy no doubt and show me how to box the compass in return for which i could show him how to box an adversarys nose as practised by the best authorities of the ring  as to geology and botany i know a little of these sciences already and could impart my knowledge to the captain which would have the effect of fixing it more firmly in my own memory and every one knows that it is of far greater importance to lay a good solid groundwork of education than to build a showy superficial structure on a bad foundation come then captain you see your advantages  this is the last time of asking  if you dont speak now henceforth and for ever hold your tongue  well my lad said the captain with much gravity ive turned the thing over in my mind and since mrs stoutley is so good as to say it would be agreeable to her i think ill accept your invitation  bravo  captain youre a true blue come have another glass of wine on the strength of it  no wine thank ee said the captain placing his hand over his glass ive had my beer and i make it a rule never to mix my liquor  excuse me maam he continued addressing his hostess your son made mention of a tootera travellin tooter may i ask if youve provided yourself with one yet  not yet answered mrs stoutley feeling but not looking a little surprised at the question i have no young friend at present quite suited for the position and at short notice it is not easy to find a youth of talent willing to go and on whom one can depend  can you recommend one  mrs stoutley accompanied the question with a smile for she put it in jest  she was therefore not a little surprised when the captain said promptly that he couldthat he knew a young mana doctorwho was just the very ticket these were his exact words a regular clipper with everything about him trim taut and shipshape who would suit every member of the family to a tee  a hearty laugh from every member of the family greeted the captains enthusiastic recommendation and emma exclaimed that he must be a most charming youth while lewis pulled out pencil and notebook to take down his name and address  you are a most valuable friend at this crisis in our affairs said lewis ill make mother write to him immediately  but have a care said the captain that you never mention who it was that recommended him  im not sure that he would regard it as a compliment  you must promise me that  i promise said lewis and whatever i promise mother will fulfil so make your mind easy on that head  now mother i shouldnt wonder if captain wopper could provide you with that other little inexpensive luxury you mentioned this morning  dyou think you could recommend a page  whats a page lad  what have you never heard of a pagea page in buttons asked lewis in surprise  never replied the captain shaking his head  why a page is a small boy usually clad in blue tights to make him look as like a spider as possible with three rows of brass buttons up the front of his jackettwo of the rows being merely ornamental and going over his shoulders  he usually wears a mans hat for the sake of congruity and is invariably as full of mischief as an egg is of meat can you find such an article  ha exclaimed the captain  what is he used for  chiefly for ornament doing messages being in the way when not wanted and out of the way when required  yes said the captain meditatively ive got my eye  your weather eye asked lewis  yes my weather eye on a lad wholl fit you  to a tee inquired emma archly  to a tee miss assented the captain with a bland smile  lewis again pulled out his notebook to enter the name and address but the captain assured him that he would manage this case himself and it was finally settledfor lewis carried everything his own way as a matter of coursethat dr george lawrence was to be written to next day and captain wopper was to provide a page  and youll have to get him and yourself ready as fast as possible said the youth in conclusion for we shall set off as soon as my mothers trunks are packed  next morning while captain wopper was seated conversing with his old landlady at the breakfasttablethe morning meal having been just concludedhe heard the voice of gillie white in the court  going to the end of the passage he ordered that imp to come aloft  gillie appeared in a few seconds nodded patronisingly to old mrs roby hoped she was salubrious and demanded to know what was up  my lad said the captainand as he spoke the urchin assumed an awful look of mock solemnity  i want to know if you think you could behave yourself if you was to try  ah said gillie with the air of a crossexamining advocate the keewestion is not wether i could behave myself if i wos to try but wether i think i could  well ahem that depends  i think i could now if there was offered a very strong indoocement  just so my lad returned the captain nodding thats exactly what i mean to offer  what dee say to a noo suit of blue tights with three rows brass buttons a situation in a respectable family a fair wage as much as you can eat and drink and a trip to switzerland to begin with  while the captain spoke the small boys eyes opened wider and wider and his month followed suit until he stood the very picture of astonishment  you dont mean it he exclaimed  indeed i do my lad  then im your man returned the small boy emphatically putt me down for that sitooation send for a lawyer draw up the articles ill sign em right off and  gillie my boy interrupted the captain one o the very first things you have to do in larnin to behave yourself is to clap a stopper on your tongueits far too long  all right cappn answered the imp ill go to guys hospital drectly and ave threefourths of it ampitated  do said the captain somewhat sternly an ask em to attach a brake to the bit thats left  now lad he continued youve got a very dirty face  gillie nodded with his lips tightly compressed to check utterance  and a very ragged head of hair he added  again gillie nodded  the captain pointed to a basin of water which stood on a chair in a corner of the room beside which lay a lump of yellow soap a comb and a rough jacktowel  there said he go to work  gillie went to work with a will and scrubbed himself to such an extent that his skin must undoubtedly have been thinner after the operation the washing however was easy compared with the combing  the boys mop was such a tangled web that the comb at first refused to pass through it and when encouraged by the captain the urchin did at last succeed in rending its masses apart various inextricable bunches came away bodily and sundry teeth of the comb were left behind  at last however it was reduced to something like order to the immense satisfaction of mrs roby and the captain  now said the latter did you ever have a turkish bath  nonever  well then come with me and have one  have you got a cap  hmnever mind come along youre not cleaned up yet by a long way but well manage it in course of time  as the captain and his small protege passed along the streets the former took occasion to explain that a turkish bath was a species of mild torture in which a man was stewed alive and baked in an oven and parboiled and scrubbed and pinched and thumped sometimes black and blue and lathered with soap till he couldnt see and heated up to seven thousand and ten fahrenheit and soused with halfboiling water and shot at with cold wateror shot into it as the case might beand rolled in a sheet like a mummy and stretched out a like corpse to cool most men he said felt gaspy in turkish baths and weak ones were alarmed lest they should get suffocated beyond recovery but strong men rather enjoy themselves in em than otherwise  hah exclaimed the imp may i wentur to ax cappn wots the effect on boys  to this the captain replied that he didnt exactly know never having heard of boys taking turkish baths  whereupon gillie suggested that if possible he might have himself cleaned in an ordinary bath  impossible my lad said the captain decidedly  no ornary bath would clean you under a week unless black soap and scrubbin brushes was used  but dont be alarmed gillie he added looking down with a twinkle in his eyes ill go into the bath along with you  well sink or swim together my boy and ill see that youre not overdone  im rather fond of them myself dee see so i can recommend em from experience  somewhat reassured by this though still a little uneasy in his mind the imp followed his patron to the baths  it would have been a sight worth seeing the entrance of these two into the temple of soapandwater  to see gillies wellmade but very meagre and dirty little limbs unrobed to see him decked out with the scrimpest possible little kilt such as would perhaps have suited the fancy of a fiji islander to see his gaze of undisguised admiration on beholding his companions towering and massive frame in the same unwonted costume if we may so style it to see the intensifying of his astonishment when ushered into the first room at beholding six or seven naked and apparently dead men laid round the walls as if ready for dissection to see the monkeylike leap accompanied by a squeal with which he sprang from a hot stonebench having sat down thereon before it had been covered with a cloth for his reception to see the rapid return of his selfpossession in these unusual circumstances and the ready manner in which he submitted himself to the various operations as if he had been accustomed to turkish baths from a period long prior to infancy to see his horror on being introduced to the hottest room and his furtive glance at the door as though he meditated a rush into the open air but was restrained by a sense of personal dignity to see the ruling passion strong as ever in this he firmly believed his nearest approach to death when observing that the man next to him who as it were turned the corner from him had raised himself for a moment to arrange his pillow he gillie tipped up the corner of the mans sheet which hung close to his face in such a manner that he the man on lying down again placed his bare shoulder on the hot stone and sprang up with a yell that startled into life the whole of the halfsleeping establishment with the exception of the youth on the opposite bench who having noticed the act was thrown into convulsions of laughter much to the alarm of gillie who had thought he was asleep and feared that he might tellto see him laid down like a little pinkroll to be kneaded and to hear him remark in a calm voice to the stalwart attendant that he might go in and win and neednt be afraid of hurting him to observe his delight when put under the warm douche his gasping shriek when unexpectedly assailed with the coldshower and his placid air of supreme felicity when wrapped up like a ghost in a white sheet and left to dry in the coolingroomto see and hear all this we say would have amply repaid a special journey to london from any reasonable distance  the event however being a thing of the past and language being unequal to the description we are compelled to leave it all to the readers imagination    chapter six  a lesson taught and learned  two days after the events narrated in the last chapter rather late in the evening dr george lawrence called at the cabin in grubbs court and found the captain taking what he called a quiet pipe  i have been visiting poor mrs leven he said to mrs roby sitting down beside her and i fear she is a good deal worse tonight  that kind little woman netta white has agreed to sit by her  im sorry that i shall be obliged to leave her at such a critical stage of her illness but i am obliged to go abroad for some time  goin abroad sir exclaimed mrs roby in surprise for the captain had not yet told her that lawrence was to be of the party although he had mentioned about himself and gillie white  yes im going with mrs stoutleys family for some weeks to switzerland  captain wopper felt that his share in the arrangements was in danger of being found out  he therefore boldly took the lead  ah  i know all about that sir  indeed said lawrence  yes i dined the other day with mrs stoutley she asked me also to be of the party and im going  lawrence again exclaimed indeed with increasing surprise and added well now that is a strange coincidence  well dee know said the captain in an argumentative tone it dont seem to me much of a coincidence  you know she had to git some one to go with her son and why not you sir as well as any of the other young sawbones in london  if she hadnt got you shed have got another and that would have been a coincidence to him dee see  then as to me it wasnt unnatural that she should take a fancy to the man that nussed her dyin husband an was chum to her brotherinlaw so you see thats how it came about and im very glad to find sir that we are to sail in company for a short time  lawrence returned this compliment heartily and was about to make some further remark when little netta white rushed into the room with a frightened look and pale cheeks exclaiming oh dr lawrence sir shes very ill  i think shes dying  without waiting for a reply the child ran out of the room followed by lawrence and mrs roby who was assisted by the captainfor she walked with great difficulty even when aided by her crutches  in a few seconds they stood beside mrs levens bed  it was a lowly bed with scant and threadbare coverings and she who lay on it was of a lowly spiritone who for many years had laid her head on the bosom of jesus and had found him through a long course of poverty and mental distress a very present help in trouble  i fear that im very ill she said faintly  no doubt you feel rather low just now said the doctor but that is very much owing to your having lived so long on insufficient diet  i will give you something however which will soon pull you up a bit come cheer up  dont let your spirits get so low  yes she murmured i am brought very low but the lord will lift me up  he is my strength and my redeemer  she clasped her hands with difficulty and shut her eyes  a silence followed during which captain wopper drew lawrence into the passage  dyou think she is near her end doctor  she looks very like it replied the doctor  there is a possibility that she might recover if the right medicine could be found namely ease of mind but her dissipated son has robbed her of that and is the only one who can give it back to herif indeed he has the power left now  she is dying of what is unprofessionally styled a broken heart it is unfortunate that her son is not with her at present  does no one know where to find him asked the captain  i fear not replied the doctor  please sir i think i know said a subdued voice behind them  it was that of gillie white who had drawn near very silently being overawed by the sad scene in the sickroom  do you my lad then get along as fast as you can and show me the way said the captain buttoning up his pilotcoat  ill bring him here before long doctor if hes to be found  in a few minutes the captain and gillie were at the head of the lane where the former hailed a passing cab bade the boy jump in and followed him  now my lad give the address said the captain  the strand said the boy promptly  what number sir asked the cabman looking at the captain  right on till i stop you said gillie with the air of a commanderinchiefwhom in some faint manner he now resembled for he was in livery being clothed in blue tights and brass buttons  in a short time gillie gave the order to pull up and they got out in front of a brilliantlylighted and open door with a lamp above it on which was written the word billiards  the captain observed that it was the same door as that at which he had parted from lewis stoutley some days before  dismissing the cab and entering they quickly found themselves in a large and welllighted billiardroom which was crowded with men of all ages and aspects some of whom played others looked on and betted a good many drank brandy and water and nearly all smoked  it was a bright scene of dissipation where many young men deceiving themselves with the idea that they went merely to practise or to enjoy a noble game of skill were taking their first steps on the road to ruin  the captain closely attended by gillie moved slowly through the room looking anxiously for fred leven  for some time they failed to find him  at last a loud curse uttered in the midst of a knot of onlookers attracted their attention  it was followed by a general laugh as a young man whose dishevelled hair and flushed face showed that he had been drinking hard burst from among them and staggered towards the door  never mind fred shouted a voice that seemed familiar to the captain youll win it back from me next time  ere the youth had passed the captain stepped forward and laid his hand on his arm  fred uttered a savage growl and drew back his clenched hand as if to strike but captain woppers size and calm look of decision induced him to hold his hand  what dyou mean by interrupting me he demanded sternly  my lad said the captain in a low solemn voice your mother is dying come with me  youve no time to lose  the youths face turned ashy pale and he passed his hand hastily across his brow  whats wrong exclaimed lewis stoutley who had recognised the captain and come forward at the moment  did he lose his money to you asked the captain abruptly  well yes he did retorted lewis with a look of offended dignity  come along then my lad  i want you too  its a case of life an death  ask no questions but come along  the captain said this with such an air of authority that lewis felt constrained to obey  fred leven seemed to follow like one in a dream they all got into a cab and were driven back to grubbs court  as they ascended the stair the captain whispered to lewis keep in the background my lad  do nothing but look and listen  another moment and they were in the passage where lawrence stopped them  youre almost too late sir he said to fred sternly  if you had fed and clothed your mother better in time past she might have got over this  fortunately for her poor soul some people who dont gamble away their own and their parents means have given her the help that you have refused  go in sir and try to speak words of comfort to her now  he went in and fell on his knees beside the bed  mother he said  fain would he have said more but no word could he utter  his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth  mrs leven opened her eyes on hearing the single word and her cheek flushed slightly as she seized one of his hands kissed it and held it to her breast  then she looked earnestly and oh so anxiously into his face and said in a low tone  fred dear are you so  she stopped abruptly  yes yes cried her son passionately yes mother im sober now oh mother dearest darling mother i am guilty guilty i have sinned oh forgive forgive me  listen listen  i am in earnest now my mother  think of me as i used to be long ago  dont shut your eyes look at me mother look at fred  the poor woman looked at him with tears of gladness in her eyes  god bless you fred she murmured  it is long long since you spoke like that  but i knew you would  i have always expected that you would  praise the lord  fred tried to speak and again found that he could not but the fountain of his soul was opened  he laid his face on his mothers hand and sobbed bitterly  those who witnessed this scene stood as if spellbound  as far as sound or motion went these two might have been in the room alone  presently the sound of sobbing ceased and fred raising his head began gently to stroke the hand he held in his  sometime in his wild career he knew not when or where he had heard it said that this slight action had often a wonderful power to soothe the sick  he continued it for some time  then the doctor advanced and gazed into the invalids countenance  she sleeps he said in a low tone  may i stay beside her whispered fred  lawrence nodded assent and then motioning to the others to withdraw followed them into mrs robys room where he told them that her sleeping was a good sign and that they must do their best to prevent her being disturbed  it wont be necessary for any one to watch  her son will prove her best attendant just now but it may be as well that some one should sit up in this room and look in now and then to see that the candle doesnt burn out and that all is right  i will go now and will make this my first visit in the morning  captain wopper said lewis stoutley in a subdued voice when lawrence had left i won this tenpound note tonight from fred  ii robbed him of it  will you give it to him in the morning  yes my lad i will said the captain  and will you let me sit up and watch here tonight  no my lad i wont  i mean to do that myself  but do let me stay an hour or so with you in case anything is wanted pleaded lewis  well you may  they sat down together by the fireside mrs roby having lain down on her bed with her clothes on but they spoke never a word and as they sat there the young mans busy brain arrayed before him many and many a scene of death and sickness and suffering and sorrow and madness and despair which he knew well from hearsay and he now believed it had been the terrible result of gambling and drink  when the hour was past the captain rose and said now lewis youll go and ill take a look at the next room  he put off his shoes and went on tiptoe  lewis followed and took a peep before parting  fred had drawn three chairs to the bedside and lain down on them with his shoulders resting on the edge of the bed so that he could continue to stroke his mothers hand without disturbing her  he had continued doing so until his head had slowly drooped upon the pillow and there they now lay the dissipated son and the humble christian mother sleeping quietly together    chapter seven  the great white mountain  we are in switzerland now in the land of the mountain and the flood the land also of perennial ice and snow  the solemn presence of the great white mountain is beginning to be felt  its pure summit was first seen from geneva its shadow is now beginning to steal over us  we are on the road to chamouni not yet over the frontier in a carriage and four  mrs stoutley being a lady of unbounded wealth always travels post in a carriage and four when she can manage to do so having an unconquerable antipathy to railroads and steamers  she could not well travel in any other fashion here railways not having yet penetrated the mountain regions in this direction and a mode of ascending roaring mountain torrents in steamboats not having yet been discovered  she might however travel with two horses but she prefers four  captain wopper who sits opposite emma gray wonders in a quiet speculative way whether the mines will produce a dividend sufficient to pay the expenses of this journey  he is quite disinterested in the thought it being understood that the captain pays his own expenses  but we wander from our text which isthe great white mountain  we are driving now under its shadow with mrs stoutleys party which in addition to the captain and miss gray already mentioned includes young dr george lawrence and lewis who are on horseback also mrs stoutleys maid mrs stoutley never travels without a maid susan quick who sits beside the captain and gillie white alias the spider and the imp who sits beside the driver making earnest but futile efforts to draw him into a conversation in english of which language the driver knows next to nothing  but to return mrs stoutley and party are now in the very heart of scenery the most magnificent they have penetrated to a great fountainhead of european waters they are surrounded by the cliffs the gorges the moraines and are not far from the snowslopes and icefields the couloirs the seracs the crevasses and the iceprecipices and pinnacles of a great glacial world but not one of the party betrays the smallest amount of interest or expresses the faintest emotion of surprise owing to the melancholy fact that all is shrouded in an impenetrable veil of mist through which a thick fine rain percolates as if the mountain monarch himself were bewailing their misfortunes  isnt it provoking murmured mrs stoutley drawing her shawl closer  very replied emma  disgusting exclaimed lewis who rode at the side of the carriage next his cousin  it might be worse said lawrence with a grim smile  impossible retorted lewis  come captain have you no remark to make by way of inspiring a little hope asked mrs stoutley  why never havin cruised in this region before answered the captain my remarks cant be of much value  howsever there is one idea that may be said to afford consolation namely that this sort o thing cant last  ive sailed pretty nigh in all parts of the globe an ive invariably found that bad weather has its limitsthat after rain we may look for sunshine and after storm calm  how cheering said lewis as the rain trickled from the point of his prominent nose  at that moment gillie white happening to cast his eyes upward beheld a vision which drew from him an exclamation of wild surprise  they all looked quickly in the same direction and there through a rent in the watery veil they beheld a little spot of blue sky rising into which was a mountaintop so pure so faint so high and inexpressibly far off yet so brilliant in a glow of sunshine that it seemed as if heaven had been opened and one of the hills of paradise revealed  it was the first near view that the travellers had obtained of these mountains of everlasting ice  with the exception of the exclamations wonderful most glorious they found no words for a time to express their feelings and seemed glad to escape the necessity of doing so by listening to the remarks of their driver as he went into an elaborate explanation of the name and locality of the particular part of mont blanc that had been thus disclosed  the rent in the mist closed almost as quickly as it had opened utterly concealing the beautiful vision but the impression it had made being a first and a very deep one could never more be removed  the travellers lived now in the faith of what they had seen  scepticism was no longer possible and in this improved frame of mind they dashed into the village of chamounione of the haunts of those whose warcry is excelsiorand drove to the best hotel  their arrival in the village was an unexpected point of interest to many wouldbe mountaineers who lounged about the place with macintoshes and umbrellas growling at the weather  any event out of the common forms a subject of interest to men who wait and have nothing to do  as the party passed them growlers gazed and speculated as to who the newcomers might be  some thought miss gray pretty some thought otherwiseto agree on any point on such a day being of course impossible  others guessed that the young fellows must be uncommonly fond of riding to get on the outside of a horse in such weather some remarked that the elderly female seemed used up or blasee and all agreedyes they did agree on this pointthat the thing in blue tights and buttons beside the driver was the most impudentlooking monkey the world had ever produced  the natives of the place also had their opinions and expressed them to each other especially the bronzed stalwart sedatelooking men who hung about in knots near the centre of the village and seemed to estimate the probability of the stout young englishmen on horseback being likely to require their services oftenfor these said the driver were the celebrated guides of chamouni men of bone and muscle and endurance and courage the leaders of those daring spirits who considerand justly sothe ascent to the summit of mont blanc or monte rosa or the matterhorn a feat the men who perform this feat it may be two or three times a weekas often as you choose to call them to it in fact and think nothing of it the men whose profession it is to risk their lives every summer from day to day for a few francs who have become so inured to danger that they have grown quite familiar with it insomuch that some of the reckless blades among them treat it now and then with contempt and pay the penalty of such conduct with their lives  sinking into a couch in her private sittingroom mrs stoutley resigned herself to susans care and while she was having her boots taken off said with a sigh  well here we are at last  what do you think of chamouni susan  rather a wet place maam aint it  with a languid smile mrs stoutley admitted that it was but added by way of encouragement that it was not always so  to which susan replied that she was glad to hear it so she was as nothink depressed her spirits so much as wet and clouds and gloom  susan was a pretty girl of sixteen tall as well as very sedate and womanly for her age  having been born in one of the midland counties of poor though remarkably honest parents who had received no education themselves and therefore held it to be quite unnecessary to bestow anything so useless on their daughter she was until very recently as ignorant of all beyond the circle of her fathers homestead as the daughter of the man in the moonsupposing no compulsory educationact to be in operation in the orb of night  having passed through them she now knew of the existence of france and switzerland but she was quite in the dark as to the position of these two countries with respect to the rest of the world and would probably have regarded them as one and the same if their boundaryline had not been somewhat deeply impressed upon her by the ungallant manner in which the customs officials examined the contents of her modest little portmanteau in search as gillie gave her to understand of tobacco  mrs stoutley had particularly small feet a circumstance which might have induced her more than other ladies to wear easy boots but owing to some unaccountable perversity of mental constitution she deemed this a good reason for having her boots made unusually tight  the removal of these therefore afforded great relief and the administration of a cup of tea produced a cheering reaction of spirits under the influence of which she partially forgot herself and resolved to devote a few minutes to the instruction of her interestingly ignorant maid  yes she said arranging herself comfortably and sipping her tea while susan busied herself putting away her ladys things and otherwise tidying the room it does not always rain here there is a little sunshine sometimes  by the way where is miss gray  in the bedroom maam unpacking the trunks  ah well as i was saying they have a little sunshine sometimes for you know susan people must live and grass or grain cannot grow without sunshine so it has been arranged that there should be enough here for these purposes but no more than enough because switzerland has to maintain its character as one of the great refrigerators of europe  one of the what maam  refrigerators explained mrs stoutley a refrigerator susan is a freezer and it is the special mission of switzerland to freeze nearly all the water that falls on its mountains and retain it there in the form of ice and snow until it is wanted for the use of man  isnt that a grand idea  the lecturers explanation had conveyed to susans mind the idea of the switzers going with long strings of carts to the top of mont blanc for supplies of ice to meet the european demand and she admitted that it was a grand idea and asked if the ice and snow lasted long into the summer  long into it exclaimed her teacher  why you foolish thing its lasts all through it  oh indeed maam said susan who entertained strong doubts in her heart as to the correctness of mrs stoutleys information on this point  yes continued that lady with more animation than she had experienced for many months past so invigorating was the change of moral atmosphere induced by this little breeze of instruction yes the ice and snow cover the hills and higher valleys for dozens and dozens of miles round here in all directions not a few inches deep such as we sometimes see in england but with thousands and millions of tons of it so that the ice in the valleys is hundreds of feet thick and never melts away altogether but remains there from year to yearhas been there i suppose since the world began and will continue i fancy until the world comes to an end  mrs stoutley warmed up here to such an extent that she absolutely flushed and susan who had heretofore regarded her mistress merely as a weakish woman now set her down mentally as a barefaced storyteller  surely maam she said with diffidence ice and snow like that doesnt fill all the valleys else we should see it and find it difficult to travel through em shouldnt we maam  silly girl exclaimed her preceptress i did not say it filled all the valleys but the higher valleysvalleys such as in england and scotland would be clothed with pasturage and waving grain and dotted with cattle and sheep and smiling cottages  mrs stoutley had by this time risen to a heroic frame and spoke poetically which accounts for her ascribing risible powers to cottages  and thus you see susan she continued switzerland is as it were a great icetank or a series of icetanks in which the ice of ages is accumulated and saved up so that the melting of a little of itthe mere dribbling of it so to speakis sufficient to cause the continuous flow of innumerable streams and of great rivers such as the rhone and the rhine and the var  the lecture received unexpected and appropriate illustration here by the sudden lifting of the mists which had hitherto blotted out the landscape  oh aunt exclaimed emma running in at the moment just look at the hills  how exquisite  how much grander than if we had seen them quite clear from the first  emma was strictly correct for it is well known that the grandeur of alpine scenery is greatly enhanced by the wild and weird movements of the gauzelike drapery with which it is almost always partially enshrouded  as the trio stood gazing in silent wonder and admiration from their window which they had been informed commanded a view of the summit of mont blanc the mist had risen like a curtain partially rolled up  all above the curtainfoot presented the dismal grey to which they had been too long accustomed but below and as it were far behind this curtain the mountainworld was seen rising upwards  so close were they to the foot of the great white monarch that it seemed to tower like a giantwall before them but this wall was varied and beautiful as well as grand  already the curtain had risen high enough to disclose hoary cliffs and precipices with steep grassy slopes between and crowned with fringes of dark pines which latter although goodly trees looked like mere shrubs in their vast setting  rills were seen running like snowy veins among the slopes and losing themselves in the masses of debris at the mountainfoot  as they gazed the curtain rose higher disclosing new and more rugged features on which shone a strange unearthly lightthe result of shadow from the mist and sunshine behind itwhile a gleam of stronger light tipped the curtains underedge in one direction  still higher it rose  susan exclaimed that the mountain was rising into heaven and emma and mrs stoutley whose reading had evidently failed to impress them with a just conception of mountainscenery stood with clasped hands in silent expectancy and admiration  the gleam of stronger light above referred to widened and susan almost shrieked with ecstasy when the curtain seemed to rend and the gleam resolved itself into the great glacier des bossons which rolling over the mountainbrow like a very world of ice thrust its mighty tongue down into the valley  from that moment susans disbelief in her ladys knowledge changed into faith and deepened into profound veneration  it was however only a slight glimpse that had been thus afforded of the iceworld by which they were surrounded  the great icefountain of those regions commencing at the summit of mont blanc flings its ample waves over mountain and vale in all directions forming a throne on which perpetual winter reigns and this glacier des bossons which filled the breasts of our travellers with such feelings of awe was but one of the numerous rivers which flow from the fountain down the gorges and higher valleys of the alps until they reach those regions where summer heat asserts itself and checks their further progress in the form of ice by melting them  is it possible said emma as she gazed at the rugged and riven mass of solid ice before her that a glacier really flows  so learned men tell us and so we must believe said mrs stoutley  flows maam exclaimed susan in surprise  yes so it is said replied mrs stoutley with a smile  but we can see maam by lookin at it that it dont flow cant we maam said susan  true susan it does not seem to move nevertheless scientific men tell us that it does and sometimes we are bound to believe against the evidence of our senses  susan looked steadily at the glacier for some time and then although she modestly held her tongue scientific men fell considerably in her esteem  while the ladies were thus discussing the glacier and enlightening their maid lewis lawrence and the captain taking advantage of the improved state of the weather had gone out for a stroll partly with a view as lewis said to freshen up their appetites for dinneralthough to say truth the appetites of all three were of such a nature as to require no freshening up  they walked smartly along the road which leads up the valley pausing ever and anon to look back in admiration at the wonderful glimpses of scenery disclosed by the lifting mists  gradually these cleared away altogether and the mountain summits stood out well defined against the clear sky  and then for the first time came a feeling of disappointment  why lawrence said lewis didnt they tell us that we could see the top of mont blanc from chamouni  they certainly did replied lawrence but i cant see it  there are two or three splendidlooking peaks said lewis pointing up the valley but surely thats not the direction of the top we look for  no my lad it aint the right point o the compass by a long way said the captain but yonder goes a strange sail ahead lets overhaul her  heave ahead then captain said lewis and clap on stunsls and skyscrapers for the strange sail is making for that cottage on the hill and will get into port before we overhaul her if we dont look sharp  the strange sail was a woman  she soon turned into the cottage referred to but our travellers followed her up arranging as they drew near that lawrence being the best french scholar of the three the captain knowing nothing whatever of the language should address her  she turned out to be a very comely young woman the wife as she explained of one of the chamouni guides named antoine grennon  her daughter a pretty blueeyed girl of six or so was busy arranging a casket of flowers and the grandmother of the family was engaged in that mysterious malletstonescrubbingbrushandcoldwater system whereby the washerwomen of the alps convert the linen of tourists into shreds and patches in the shortest possible space of time  after some complimentary remarks lawrence asked if it were possible to see the summit of mont blanc from where they stood  certainly it was the guides pretty wife could point it out and attempted to do so but was for a long time unsuccessful owing to the interference of preconceived notionseach of our travellers having set his heart upon beholding a majestic peak of rugged rock mingled perhaps with iceblocks and snow  most extraordinary exclaimed the puzzled captain ive squinted often enough at wellknown peaks when on the lookout for landmarks from the sea an never failed to make em out  let me see he added getting behind the woman so as to look straight along her outstretched arm no i cant see it  my eyes must be giving way  surely said lawrence you dont mean that little piece of smooth snow rising just behind the crest of yonder mountain like a bit of rounded sugar  oui monsieurthat was precisely what she meant that was the summit of mont blanc  and so our three travellerslike many hundreds of travellers who had gone before them and like many doubtless who shall followwere grievously disappointed with their first view of mont blanc  they lived however to change their minds to discover that the village of chamouni lies too close to the toe of the great white mountain to permit of his being seen to advantage  one may truly see a small scrap of the veritable top from chamouni but one cannot obtain an idea of what it is that he sees  as well might a beetle walk close up to the heel of a man and attempt from that position to form a correct estimate of his size as well might one plant himself two inches distant from a large painting and expect to do it justice  no in order to understand mont blanc to realise it to appreciate it adequately it requires that we should stand well back and get up on one of the surrounding heights and make the discovery that as we rise he rises and looks vaster and more tremendous the further off we go and the higher up we rise until with foot planted on the crest of one of the neighbouring giants we still look up as well as down and learnwith a feeling of deeper reverence it may be for the maker of the everlasting hillsthat the grand monarch with the hoary head does in reality tower supreme above them all    chapter eight  introduces the reader to various personages and touches on glaciers  at this time our travellers having only just been introduced to the mountain had a great deal to hear and see before they understood him they returned to the hotel with the feeling of disappointment still upon them but with excellent appetites for dinner  in the salle a manger they met with a miscellaneous assortment of tourists  these of whom there were above thirty varied not only as to size and feature but as to country and experience  there were veteran alpine mensteady quiet bronzedlooking fellows some of themwho looked as if they had often attacked and conquered the most dangerous summits and meant to do so again  there were men and women too from england america germany france and russia  some had been at chamouni before and wore the selfpossessed air of knowledge others had obviously never been there before and were excited  many were full of interest and expectation a few chiefly very young men wore a blase halfpitiful halfpatronising air as though to say thats right good people amuse yourselves with your daydreams while you may we have tried a few weeks of this sort of thing and have done a summit or two in imagination we have also been up mont blanc and monte rosa and the matterhorn and a few of the hymalaya peaks and most of the mountains in the moon and several of the fixed stars andhaware now rather boaord with it all than otherwise  there were men who had done much and who said little and men who had done little and who spoke much  there were icemen who had a desire to impart their knowledge and wouldbe icemen who were glad to listen  easygoing men and women there were who flung the cares of life behind them and went in as they said for enjoyment and who with abounding animal spirits a dash of religious sentiment much irrepressible humour and fun were really pleasant objects to look at and entertaining companions to travel with earnest men and women there were too who gathered plants and insects and made pencilsketches and watercolour drawings during their rambles among mountains and valleys and not a few of whom chronicled faithfully their experiences from day to day  there was a polish count a tall handsome middleaged careworn anxiouslooking man who came there apparently in search of health and who was cared for and taken care of by a darkeyed little daughter  this daughter was so beautiful that it ought to have made the count wellso thought most of the young men simply to look at her  there was a youthful british lord who had come to do mont blanc and a few other peaks  he was under charge of a young man of considerable experience in mountaineering whose chief delight seemed to be the leading of his charge to wellknown summits by any other and more difficult tracks than the obvious and right ones insomuch that lewis stoutley who had a tendency to imprudent remark said in his hearing that he had heard of men who in order to gain the roof of a house preferred to go up by the waterspout rather than the staircase  there was an artist whom lewisbeing as already observed given to insolencestyled the mad artist because he was enthusiastic in his art galvanic in his actions and had large wild eyes with long hair and a broadbrimmed conical hat  besides these there was a russian professor who had come there for purposes of scientific investigation and a couple of german students and a scotch man of letters whose aim was general observation and several others whose end was simply seeing the world  in the arrangements of the table captain wopper found himself between emma gray and the polish count whose name was horetzki  directly opposite to him sat mrs stoutley having her son lewis on her right and dr lawrence on her left  beside the count sat his lovely little daughter nita and just opposite to her was the mad artist  this arrangement was maintained throughout the sojourn of the various parties during their stay at chamouni  they did indeed shift their position as regarded the table according to the arrival or departure of travellers but not in regard to each other  now it is an interesting but by no means surprising fact that cupid planted himself in the midst of this party and with his fat little legs in imminent danger of capsizing the dishes began to draw his bow and let fly his arrows right and left  being an airy sprite though fat and not at any time particularly visible a careless observer might have missed seeing him but to any one with moderate powers of observation he was there straddling across a dish of salad as plain as the saltcellar before captain woppers nose  his deadly shafts too were visibly quivering in the breasts of lewis stoutley george lawrence and the mad artist  particularly obvious were these shafts in the case of the last who was addicted to gazing somewhat presumptuously on lovely woman in general from what he styled an artistic point of viewnever from any other point of view of course not  whether or not cupid had discharged his artillery at the young ladies we cannot say for they betrayed no evidence of having been wounded  in their case he must either have missed his aim or driven his shafts home with such vigour that they were buried out of sight altogether in their tender hearts  it is probable that not one member of that miscellaneous company gave a thought at that time to the wounded men except the wounded men themselves so absorbing is the love of food the wounded were however sharpset in all respects  they at once descried each others condition and instead of manifesting sympathy with each other were strange to say filled with intense jealousy this at least is true of the younger men  lawrence being somewhat older was more secretive and selfpossessed  at first captain wopper having declined a dish of cauliflower because it was presented alone and having afterwards accepted a mutton chop alone with feelings of poignant regret that he had let the cauliflower go by was too busy to observe what the heathenmythological youngster was doing  indeed at most times the said youngster might have discharged a whole quiver of arrows into the captains eyes without his being aware of the attack but at the present time the captain as the reader is aware was up to the eyes in a plot in which cupids aid was necessary he had as it were invoked the fat childs presence when therefore he had got over the regrets about the cauliflower and had swallowed the muttonchop he began to look about himto note the converse that passed between the young men and the frequent glances they cast at the young women  it was not the first time that the captain had so to speak kept his weathereye open in regard to the affection which he had made up his mind must now have been awakened in the breasts of george lawrence and emma gray but hitherto his hopes although sanguine had not received encouragement  though polite and respectful to each other they were by no means tender altogether they acted quite differently from what the captain felt that he would have done in similar circumstances  a suspicion had even crossed the poor seamans mind that emma was in love with her handsome and rattling cousin lewis but anxiety on this head was somewhat allayed by other and conflicting circumstances such as occasional remarks by lewis to the effect that emma was a goose or a pert little monkey or that she knew nothing beyond housekeeping and crochet and similar compliments  now however in a certain animated conversation between lawrence and emma the designing seaman thought he saw the budding of his deeplaid plans and fondly hoped ere long to behold the bud developed into the flower of matrimony  under this conviction he secretly hugged himself but in the salon that evening he opened his arms and released himself on beholding the apparently fickle lawrence deeply engaged in converse with the count horetzki to whose pretty daughter however he addressed the most of his remarks  the captain being a blunt honest straightforward man could not understand this state of matters and fell into a fit of abstracted perplexity on the sofa beside mrs stoutley who listened listlessly to the russian professor as he attempted to explain to her and emma the nature of a glacier  well i dont understand it at all said mrs stoutley at the end of one of the professors most lucid expositions  we may remark in passing that the professor like many of his countrymen was a good linguist and spoke english well  not understand it he exclaimed with a slight elevation of his eyebrows  my dear madam it is most plain but i fear my want of good english does render me not quite intelligible  your english is excellent replied mrs stoutley with a smile but i fear that my brain is not a sufficiently clear one on such matters for i confess that i cannot understand it  can you captain wopper  certainly not maam answered the captain thinking of the fickle lawrence it takes the wind out of my sails entirely  indeed said the professor  well do permit me to try again  you understand that all the mountaintops and elevated plateaus for many miles around here are covered with ice and snow  oh exclaimed the captain awaking to the fact that his answer was not relevant may i ax what is the particular pint that puzzles you maam  emma laughed aloud at this and coughed a little to conceal the fact she was rather easily taken by surprise with passing touches of the ludicrous and had not yet acquired the habit of effectually suppressing little explosions of undertoned mirth  the thing that puzzles me said mrs stoutley is that glaciers should flow as i am told they do and yet that they should be as hard and brittle as glass  ah well yes just so hm said the captain looking very wise that is exactly the pint that i want to know myself for no man who looks at the great tongue of that glacier day bossung  des bossons said the professor with a bland smile  day bossong repeated the captain can deny that it is marked with all the lines and waves an eddies of a rollin river an yet as little can they deny that it seems as hardandfast as the rock of gibraltar  the professor nodded approvingly  you are right captain whipper  wopper said the captain with a grave nod  wopper repeated the professor the glacier des bossons like all the other glaciers seems to remain immovable though in reality it flows ever flowsdownward but its motion is so slow that it is not perceptible to the naked eye  similarly the hourhand of a watch is to appearance motionless  do you want proof  mark it just now look again in quarter of an hour and you see that it has moved  you are convinced  it is so with the glacier  mark him today go back tomorrowthe mark has changed  some glaciers flow at the rate of two and three feet in the twentyfour hours  yes but how do they flow being so brittle demanded mrs stoutley  ay thats the pint professor said the captain nodding how do they flow bein made of hard and brittle ice  why by rolling higgledypiggledy over itself of course said lewis flippantly as he came up and sat down on the end of the sofa being out of humour with himself and everybody in consequence of having utterly failed to gain the attention of nita horetzki although he had made unusually earnest efforts to join in conversation with her father owing to somewhat similar feelings the artist had flung himself into a chair and sat glaring at the black fireplace with a degree of concentration that ought to have lighted the firewood therein  the cause of a glacier flowing said the professor has long been a disputed point  some men of science have held that it is the pressure of ice and snow behind it which causes it to flow  they do not think that it flows like water but say it is forced from behind and crushed through gorges and down valleys as it were unwillingly  they say that if left alone as they now are without additions from this time forward glaciers would no longer move they would rest and slowly melt away that their motion is due to the fact that there are miles and miles of snowfields thousands of feet deep on the mountaintops and in the gorges to which fresh snows are added every winter so that the weight of what is behind slipping off the slopes and falling from the cliffs crushes down and forward that which is below thus glaciers cannot choose but advance  ay ay said the captain no doubt no doubt that may be so but why is it that bein as brittle as glass a glacier dont come rumblin and clatterin down the valleys in small hard bits like ten thousand millions of smashedup chandeliers  ay theres the rub exclaimed lewis what say you to that  ha exclaimed the professor again smiling blandly there you have touched what once was and to some philosophers it seems still is the great difficulty  by some great men it has been held that glacier ice is always in a partially soft viscid or semifluid condition somewhat like pitch so that although apparently a solid brittle and rigid body it flows sluggishly in reality  other philosophers have denied this theory insisting that the ice of glaciers is not like pitch but like glass and that it cannot be squeezed without being broken nor drawn without being cracked  these philosophers have discovered that when ice is subjected to great pressure it melts and that when the pressure is removed the part so melted immediately freezes againhence the name regelation or refreezing is given to the process  thus a glacier they say is in many places being continually melted and continually and instantaneously refrozen so that it is made to pass through narrow gorges and to open out again when the enormous pressure has been removed  but this theory of regelation although unquestionably true and although it exercises some influence on glacier motion does not in my opinion alone account for it  the opinion which seems to be most in favour among learned menand that which i myself hold firmlyis the theory of the scottish professor forbes namely that a glacier is a semifluid body it is largely impregnated throughout its extent with water its particles move round and past each otherin other words it flows in precisely the same manner as water the only difference being that it is not quite so fluid it is sluggish in its flow but it certainly models itself to the ground over which it is forced by its own gravity and it is only rent or broken into fragments when it is compelled to turn sharp angles or to pass over steep convex slopes  forbes by his careful measurements and investigations proved incontestably that in some glaciers the central portion travelled down its valley at double or treble the rate of its sides without the continuity of the mass being broken  in small masses indeed glacierice is to all appearance rigid but on a large scale it is unquestionably ductile  has the theory of regelation been put to the proof asked lewis with a degree of interest in glaciers which he had never before felt  it has answered the professor  an experimentalist once cut a bar of solid ice like to a bar of soap in form and size from a glacier  to this an iron weight of several pounds was suspended by means of a very fine wire which was tied round the bar  the pressure of the wire melted the ice under it as the water escaped it instantly refroze above the wire thus the wire went on cutting its way through the bar and the water went on freezing until at last the weight fell to the ground and left the bar as solid and entire as if it had never been cut  well now said captain wopper bringing his hand down on his thigh with a slap that did more to arouse mrs stoutley out of her languor than the professors lecture on glacier ice ive sailed round the world i have an seen many a strange sight and what ive got to say is that ill believe that when i see it  you shall see it soon then i hope said the professor more blandly than ever for i intend to verify this experiment along with several others  i go to the mer de glace perhaps as far as the jardin tomorrow  will you come  what may the jardang be asked the captain  hallo monkey whats wrong said lewis to emma referring to one of the undertoned safetyvalves before mentioned  nothing replied emma pursing her little lips till they resembled a cherry  the jardin or garden said the professor is a little spot of exquisite beauty in the midst of the glaciers where a knoll of green grass and flowers peeps up in the surrounding sterility  it is one of the regular excursions from chamouni  can ladies go asked lewis  young and active ladies can said the professor with his blandest possible smile as he bowed to emma  then well all go together cried lewis with energy  not all said mrs stoutley with a sigh i am neither young nor active  nonsense mother youre quite young yet you know and as active as a kitten when youve a mind to be  come well have a couple of porters and a chair to have you carried when you knock up  notwithstanding the glowing prospects of ease and felicity thus opened up to her mrs stoutley resolutely refused to go on this excursion but she generously allowed emma to go if so disposed  emma being disposed it was finally arranged that on the following day she the captain lewis and lawrence with gillie white as her page should proceed up the sides of mont blanc with the man of science and over the mer de glace to the jardin    chapter nine  a solid stream  there is a river of ice in switzerland which taking its rise on the hoary summit of mont blanc flows through a sinuous mountainchannel and terminates its grand career by liquefaction in the vale of chamouni a mighty river it is in all respects and a wonderful onefull of interest and mystery and apparent contradiction  it has a grand volume and sweep varying from one to four miles in width and is about twelve miles long with a depth of many hundreds of feet  it is motionless to the eye yet it descends into the plain continually  it is hard and unyielding in its nature yet it flows as really and steadily if not with as lithe a motion as a liquid river  it is not a half solid mass like mud which might roll slowly down an incline it is solid clear transparent brittle ice which refuses to bend and cracks sharply under a strain nevertheless it has its waves and rapids crosscurrents eddies and cascades which seen from a moderate distance display all the grace and beauty of flowing wateras if a grand river in all its varied parts calm and turbulent had been actually and suddenly arrested in its course and frozen to the bottom  it is being melted perpetually too  the fierce sun of summer sends millions of tiny streamlets down into its interior which collect augment cut channels for themselves through the ice and finally gush into the plain from its lower end in the form of a muddy river  even in winter this process goes on yet the iceriver never melts entirely away but holds on its cold stately solemn course from year to year has done so for unknown ages and will probably do so to the end of time  it is picturesque in its surroundings majestic in its motion tremendous in its action awful in its sterility and altogether one of the most impressive and sublime works of god  this gigantic glacier or stream of ice springing as it does from the giantmountain of europe is appropriately hemmed in and its mighty force restrained by a group of titans whose sharp aiguilles or needlelike peaks shoot upward to a height little short of their rounded and whiteheaded superior and from whose wild gorges and riven sides tributary icerivers flow and avalanches thunder incessantly leaving its cradle on the top of mont blanc the great river sweeps round the aiguille du geant and after receiving its first name of glacier du geant from that mighty obelisk of rock which rises 13156 feet above the sea it passes onward to welcome two grand tributaries the glacier de lechaud from the rugged heights of the grandes jorasses and the glacier du talefre from the breast of the aiguille du talefre and the surrounding heights  thus augmented the river is named the mer de glace or sea of ice and continues its downward course but here it encounters what may be styled the narrows between the crags at the base of the aiguille charmoz and aiguille du moine through which it steadily forces its way though compressed to much less than half its width by the process  in one place the glacier du geant is above eleven hundred yards wide that of the lechaud is above eight hundred that of talefre above six hundredthe total when joined two thousand five hundred yards and this enormous mass of solid ice is forced through a narrow neck of the valley which is in round numbers only nine hundred yards wide  of course the iceriver must gain in depth what it loses in breadth in this gorge through which it travels at the rate of twenty inches a day  thereafter it tumbles ruggedly to its termination in the vale of chamouni under the name of the glacier des bois  the explanation of the causes of the rise and flow of this iceriver we will leave to the genial and enthusiastic professor who glories in dilating on such matters to captain wopper who never tires of the dilations  huge however though this glacier of the mer de glace be it is only one of a series of similar glaciers which constitute the outlets to that vast reservoir of ice formed by the wide range of mont blanc where the snows of successive winters are stored packed solidified and rendered as it were selfregulating in their supplies of water to the plains  and the mont blanc range itself is but a portion of the great glacial world of switzerland the area occupied by which is computed at 900 square miles  twothirds of these send their waters to the sea through the channel of the rhine  the most extensive of these glaciers is the aletsch glacier which is fifteen miles in length  it is said that above six hundred distinct glaciers have been reckoned in switzerland  this good reader is but a brief reference to the wonders of the glacial world  it is but a scratching of the surface  there is a very mine of interesting curious and astonishing facts below the surface nature is prodigal of her information to those who question her closely correctly and perseveringly  even to those who observe her carelessly she is not altogether dumb  she is generous and the god of nature has caused it to be written for our instruction that his works are wonderful sought out of all them that have pleasure therein  we may not however prolong our remarks on the subject of icerivers at this time  our travellers at chamouni are getting ready to start and it is our duty at present to follow them    chapter ten  the first excursion  a splendid morning exclaimed dr george lawrence as he entered the salle a manger with an obviously new alpenstock in his hand  jolly replied lewis stoutley who was stooping at the moment to button one of his gaiters  lewis was addicted to slang not by any means an uncommon characteristic of youth  the man he said with some bitterness who invented big buttons and little buttonholes should have had his nose skewered with a buttonhook  he was an ass  in order to relieve his feelings and accomplish his ends lewis summarily enlarged the holes with his penknife  and round buttons too he said indignantly what on earth was the use of making round buttons when flat ones had been invented  a big hole and a flat button will hold against anythingeven against scotch whins and heather  there now that abominable job is done  you are fond of strong language lewie said lawrence as he examined the spike at the end of his alpenstock  i am  it relieves my feelings  but dont you think it weakens your influence on occasions when nothing but strong language will serve  you rob yourself of the power you know to increase the force of it  oh bother dont moralise man but lets have your opinion of the weather which is an allimportant subject just now  i have already given my opinion as to that said lawrence but here comes one who will give us an opinion of valuehe is in capital time  good morning antoine  their guide for the day antoine grennon a fine stalwart specimen of his class returned the salutation and added that it was a very fine morning  capital isnt it cried lewis cheerfully for he had got over the irritation caused by the buttons  couldnt be better could it  the guide did not admit that the weather could not be better  you look doubtful antoine said lawrence  dont you think the day will keep up  keep up exclaimed lewis why the sky is perfectly clear  of course it will  i never saw a finer day even in england  why do you doubt it antoine  the guide pointed to a small cloud that hung over the brow of one of the higher peaks  appearances are sometimes deceitful in this country he said  i dont doubt the fineness of the day at present but  he was interrupted here by the sudden and noisy entrance of captain wopper and the professor followed by the mad artist whose name by the way was slingsby  no no said the captain to the professor with whom he had already become very intimate it wont do to part company  if the jardang is too far for the ladies we will steer for the mairdyglass an cross over to the whatsisname  chapeau said the professor  ah the shappo continued the captain and so down by the glacier dez boys  the what asked lewis with a halfsuppressed smile  the glacier dez boys youngster repeated the captain stoutly  oh i see you mean the glacier des bois said lewis suppressing the smile no longer  what i mean young man said the captain sternly is best known to myself  you and other collegebred coxcombs may call it day bwa if you like but i have overhauled the chart and there its spelt des which sounds dez and bois which seafarin men pronounce boys so dont go for to cross my hawse again but rather join me in tryin to indooce the professor to putt off his trip to the jardang an sail in company with us for the day  i will join you heartily in that said lewis turning to the man of science who stood regarding the captain with an amiable smile as a huge newfoundland dog might regard a large mastiff but why is our proposed excursion to the jardin to be altered  because said the professor your amiable sisteri beg pardon cousinwith that irresistible power of suasion which seems inherent in her nature has prevailed on mademoiselle horetzki to join the party and mademoiselle is too delicatesylphliketo endure the fatigues of so long an excursion over the ice  our worthy guide suggests that it would afford more pleasure to the ladiesand of course therefore to the gentlemenif you were to make your first expedition only to the montanvert which is but a two hours climb from chamouni picnic there cross the mer de glace which is narrow at that point and descend again to chamouni by the side of the glacier des bois where you can behold the great moraines and also the source of the river arveiron  this would be a pleasant and not too fatiguing round and i who might perhaps be an encumbrance to you will prosecute my inquiries at the jardin alone  impossible exclaimed lewis the captain is right when he observes that we must not part company  as my mother says we are a giddy crew and will be the better of a little scientific ballast to keep us from capsizing into a crevasse  do come my dear sir if it were only out of charity to keep us in order  to this entreaty lawrence and the artist added their persuasions which were further backed by the eloquence of emma gray and nita horetzki who entered at the moment radiant with the flush of lifes dawning day and irresistible in picturesque mountain attire the chief characteristics of which consisted in an extensive looping up of drapery and an ostentatious display of those staffs called alpenstocks five feet long tipped with chamois horn which are an indispensable requisite in alpine work  oh you muss go said nita in silvery tones and disjointed english if you go not monsieur i go not  that of course decides the question mademoiselle said the gallant professor with one of his blandest smiles i shall accompany you with pleasure  but i have one little request to make  my time at chamouni is short will you permit me on arriving at the mer de glace to prosecute my inquiries  i am here to ask questions of nature and must do so with perseverance and patience  will you allow me to devote more of my attention to her than to yourself  hm wellwhat you say mademoiselle gray demanded nita with an arch look at her companion  is the professors request reasonable  to this emma replied that as nature was upon the whole a more important lady than either of them she thought it was reasonable whereupon the professor agreed to postpone his visit to the jardin and devote his day to fixing stakes and making observations on the mer de glace with a view to ascertaining the diurnal rate of speed at which the glacier flowed  you spoke of putting certain questions to nature professor said lawrence when the party were slowly toiling up the mountainside have they not already been put to her and satisfactorily answered some time ago  they have been put replied the professor by such learned men as saussure agassiz rendu charpentier and by your own countryman forbes and others and undoubtedly their questions have received distinct answers insomuch that our knowledge of the nature and action of glacial ice is now very considerable  but my dear sir learned men have not been agreed as to what natures replies mean nor have they exhausted the subject besides no true man of science is quite satisfied with merely hearing the reports of others he is not content until he has met and conversed with nature face to face  i wish therefore to have a personal interview with her in these alps or rather continued the professor in a more earnest tone i do wish to see the works of my maker with my own eyes and to hear his voice with the ears of my own understanding  your object then is to verify not to discover said lawrence  it is both  primarily to verify but the man of science always goes forth with the happy consciousness that the mine in which he proposes to dig is rich in gems and that while seeking for one sort he may light upon another unexpectedly  when captain wopper turned up yonder gem he lit on one which if not of the purest water is unquestionably a brilliant specimen of the class to which it belongs said lewis coming up at that moment and pointing to a projection in the somewhat steep part of the path up which they were winding  the gem referred to was no other than our friend gillie white  that hilarious youth although regenerated outwardly as regards blue cloth and buttons had not by any means changed his spirit since fortune began to smile on him  finding that his mistress being engaged with her darkeyed friend did not require his services and observing that his patron captain wopper held intercourse with the guidein broken english because he the guide also spoke broken englishthat lawrence and the professor seemed capable of entertaining each other that lewis and the artist although dreadfully jealous of each other were fain to hold social intercourse the ladies being inseparable and that he gillie was therefore left to entertain himself he set about amusing himself to the best of his power by keeping well in rear of the party and scrambling up dangerous precipices throwing stones at little birds charging shrubs and stabbing the earth with emmas alpenstock immolating snails rolling rocks down precipitous parts of the hill and otherwise exhibiting a tendency to sport with natureall of which he did to music whistled by himself and in happy forgetfulness of everything save the business in hand  he was engaged in some apparently difficult piece of fancy work involving large boulders when lewis drew attention to him  what can the imp be up to he said  most likely worrying some poor reptile to death said the artist removing his conical wideawake and fanning himself therewith  mr slingsby was very warm his slender frame not being equal to his indomitable spirit  i think he is trying to break your alpenstock emma observed lewis  there seemed to be truth in this for gillie having fixed the staff as a lever was pulling at it with all his might  the projection of rock on which he stood and which overhung the zigzag road was partially concealed by bushes so that the precise intention of his efforts could not be discovered  at that moment antoine the guide turned to see what detained the party and instantly uttered a loud shout of alarm as he ran back to them  the warning or remonstrance came too late  gillie had loosened an enormous rock which had been on the point of falling and with a throb of exultation which found vent in a suppressed squeal he hurled a mass something about the size and weight of a cart of coals down the precipice  but the current of gillies feelings was rudely changed when a shriek from the ladies and something between a roar and a yell from the gentlemen told that they had observed a man with a mule who in ascending from the valley had reached a spot which lay in the direct line of the miniature avalanche and when the muleteer also observing the missile added a hideous howl to the chorus the poor urchin shrank back appalled  the rock struck the track directly behind the mule with a force which had it been expended only six inches more to the right would have driven that creatures hind legs into the earth as if they had been tenpenny nails it then bounded clear over the next turning of the track crashed madly through several bushes overturned five or six trees knocked into atoms a sister rock which had taken the same leap some ages before and finally leaving behind it a grand tail of dust and debris rolled to its rest upon the plain  at the first symptom of the danger captain wopper had rushed towards the culprit  rascal he growled between his teeth as he seized gillie by the nape of the neck lifted him almost off his legs and shook him dee see what youve done  he thrust the urchin partially over the precipice and pointed to the man and the mule  please i havent done it pleaded gillie  but you did your best toyouyou smallthere  he finished off the sentence with an openhanded whack that aroused the echoes of mont blanc and cast the culprit adrift  now look ee lad said the captain with impressive solemnity if you ever go to chuck stones like that over the precipices of this here mountain again ill chuck you over after em  dee hear  yes cappen grumbled gillie rubbing himself but if you do its murder  no jury of englishmen would think of recommendin you to mercy in the succumstances  youd be sure to swingan ii could wish you a better fate  the captain did not wait to hear the boys good wishes but hastened to rejoin his friends while gillie followed in rear commenting audibly on the recent incident  well well he said thrusting both hands deep into bush trouserpockets according to custom when in a moralising frame of mind whod a thought it gillie white that youd ave bin brought all the way from london to the halps to make such a close shave o committin manslaughter to say nothin of muleslaughter and to git whacked by your best friend  oh  cappen cappen i couldnt ave believed it of you if i adnt felt it  but i say gillie wasnt it a big un ha ha  the cappen threatened to chuck me over the precipice but ive chucked over a wopper that beats him all to sticks  hallo  i say thats worthy of punch  praps ill be a contributor to it wen i gets back from zwizzerland if i ever does get back vich is by no means certain  susan my girl ill ave summat to enliven you with this evenin  we need scarcely say that this last remark had reference to mrs stoutleys maid with whom the boy had become a great favourite  indeed the regard was mutual though there was this difference about it that susan being two years older than gillie and tall as well as womanly for her age looked upon the boy as a precocious little oddity whereas gillie esteeming himself a manall butregarded susan with the powerful feelings of a first affection  from this and what has been already said it will be apparent to our fair readers that cupid had accompanied mrs stoutleys party to chamouni with the intention apparently of amusing himself as well as interfering with captain woppers matrimonial designs  the road to the montanvert is a broad and easy bridlepath which after leaving the valley traverses a pineforest in its ascent and becomes in places somewhat steep  here and there a zigzag is found necessary and in several places there are tracks of avalanches  about halfway up there is a spring named the caillet which was shaded by trees in days of yore but the avalanches have swept these away  beside the spring of pure water there was a spring of firewater in a hut where socalled refreshments might also be obtained  as none of our party deemed it necessary to stimulate powers which at that time of the day were fresh and vigorous they passed this point of temptation without halting  other temptations however were not so easily resisted  the professor was stopped by rocky stratifications the ladies were stopped by flowers and views the younger gentlemen were of course stopped by the ladies and the mad artist was stopped by everything  poor mr slingsby who had been asked to join the party in virtue of his being a friend of the count and therefore of nita was so torn by the conflict resulting from his desire to cultivate nita and cut out lewis and lawrence and his desire to prosecute his beloved art that he became madder than usual  splendid foregrounds met him at every turn lovely middledistances chained him in everywhere enchanting backgrounds beset him on all sides gorgeous colours dazzled him above and below and nitas black eyes pierced him continually through and through  it was terrible  he was constantly getting into positions of dangergoing out on ledges to obtain particular views rolling his large eyes pulling off his hat and tossing back his long hair so as to drink in more thoroughly the beauties around him and clambering up precipices to fetch down bunches of wild flowers when nita chanced to express the most distant allusion to or admiration of them  he will leave his bones in one crevasse growled antoine on seeing him rush to a point of vantage and for the fiftieth time squat down to make a rapid sketch of some exquisite bit that had taken his fancy  tis of no use he said on returning to his friends i cannot sketch  the beauties around me are too much for me  he glanced timidly at nita who looked at him boldly laughed and advised him to shut his eyes so as not to be distracted with such beauties  impossible i cannot choose but look  see he said pointing backward to their track see what a lovely effect of tender blue and yellow through yonder opening  dyou mean gillie asked lewis with a quiet grin as that reckless youth suddenly presented his blue coat and yellow buttons in the very opening referred to  the laugh called forth by this was checked by the voice of captain wopper who was far in advance shouting to them to come on  a few minutes more and the whole party stood on the montanvert beside the small inn which has been erected there for the use of summer tourists and from which point the great glacier broke for the first time in all its grandeur on their view  well might emma and nita stand entranced for some time unable to find utterance to their feelings save in the one wordwonderful  even slingsbys mercurial spirit was awed into silence for straight before them the white and frozen billows of the mer de glace stretched for miles away up into the gorges of the giant hills until lost in and mingled with the clouds of heaven    chapter eleven  the pursuit of science under difficulties  after the first burst of enthusiasm and interest had abated the attention of the party became engrossed in the proceedings of the professor who with his assistants began at once to adjust his theodolite and fix stakes in the ice  while he was thus engaged captain wopper regarded the mer de glace with a gaze of fixedness so intense as to draw on him the attention and arouse the curiosity of his friends  dyou see anything curious captain asked emma who chanced to stand beside him  cooriouseh repeated the captain slowly without altering his gaze or adding to his reply  monsieur le capitaine is lost in consternation said nita with a smile  i think miss horetzki said lewis that you probably mean admiration  how you knows wat i mean demanded nita quickly  ha a very proper and pertinent question observed slingsby in an audible though under tone  i nevair do put pertinent questions sir said nita turning her black eyes sharply though with something of a twinkle in them on the mad artist  poor slingsby began to explain but nita cut him short by turning to lewis and again demanding how you knows wat i mean  the uniform propriety of your thoughts mademoiselle replied lewis with a continental bow and an air of pretended respect induces me to suppose that your words misinterpret them  nitas knowledge of english was such that this remark gave her only a hazy idea of the youths meaning she accepted it however as an apologetic explanation and ordered him to awaken the captain and find out from him what it was that so riveted his attention  you hear my orders said lewis laying his hand with a slap on the captains shoulder  what are you staring at  move murmured the captain returning as it were to consciousness with a long deep sigh it dont move an inch  what does not move said lawrence who had been assisting to adjust the theodolite and came forward at the moment  the ice to be sure answered the captain  i say professor do ee mean to tell me that the whole of that there mairdyglass is movin  i do answered the professor pausing for a minute in his arrangements and looking over his spectacles at the captain with an amused expression  then returned the captain with emphasis i think youll find that youre mistaken  ha  captain weeper  wopper said the captain  wopper repeated the professor you are not the first who has expressed disbelief in what he cannot see and you will assuredly not be the last but if you will wait i will convince you  very good replied the captain im open to conviction  which means said lewis that you have nailed your colours to the mast and mean to die rather than give in  no doubt said the captain paying no attention to the last remark i see and believe that at some time or other the ice here must have been in a flowin state  im too well aware o the shape of waves an eddies crosscurrents and ripples to doubt or deny that but any man with half an eye can see that its anchored hard and fast now  ive looked at it without flinchin for good ten minutes and not the smallest sign of motion can i detect  so might you say of the hourhand of a watch observed lawrence  not at all retorted the captain becoming argumentative  i look at the hourhand of a watch for ten minutes and dont see it move but i do see that it has in reality passed over a very small but appreciable space in that time  just so said the professor i will ere long show you the same thing in regard to the ice  ill bet you ten thousand pounds you dont returned the captain with an assured nod  colours nailed said lewis but i say captain he added remonstratively i thought you were a sworn enemy to gambling  isnt betting gambling  it is young man answered the captain but i always bet ten thousand pounds sterling which i never mean to pay if i lose nor to accept if i winand that is not gambling  put that in your pipe and smoke it and if youll take my advice youll go look after your friend slingsby who is gambolling up yonder in another fashion that will soon bring him to grief if hes not stopped  all eyes were turned towards the mad artist who finding that his advances to mademoiselle nita were not well received had for the time forsaken her and returned to his first and professional love  in wooing her he had clambered to an almost inaccessible cliff from which he hoped to obtain a very sketchable view of the mer de glace and when captain wopper drew attention to him was making frantic efforts to swing himself by the branch of a tree to a projecting rock which was so slightly attached to its parent cliff that his weight would in all probability have hurled it and himself down the precipice  the remonstrative shouts of his friends however induced him to desist and he sat down to work in a less perilous position  meanwhile the professor having completed his preliminary preparations ordered his assistants to go and fix the stakes in the ice  it had been arranged that while the scientific experiments were in progress the young ladies should ramble about the neighbourhood in search of flowers and plants under the care of lewis until two oclock at which hour all were to assemble at the montanvert hotel for luncheon captain wopper and lawrence resolving to remain and assist or at least observe the professor  the former indeed bearing in mind his great and ruling wish even in the midst of scientific doubt and inquiries had suggested that the latter should also accompany the ladies the country being somewhat rugged and the ladiesespecially miss emmanot being very surefooted but lawrence to his disappointment had declined saying that the ladies had a sufficient protector in the gallant lewis and that miss emma was unquestionably the surestfooted of the whole party  lawrence therefore remained and at the professors request accompanied the party who were to fix the stakes on the ice  as this operation was attended with considerable difficulty and some danger we will describe the process  finding that the spot which he had first chosen for his observations was not a very good one the professor changed his position to a point farther down on the steep sloping rocks that form the left bank of the glacier des bois  here the theodolite was fixed  this instrument as even our young readers may probably know is a small telescope attached to a stand with three long legs and having spiritlevels by means of which it can be fixed in a position if we may say so of exact flatness with reference to the centre of the earth  within the telescope are two crossed hairs of a spidersweb so fine as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye and so arranged that their crossingpoint is exactly in the centre of the tube  by means of pivots and screws the telescope can be moved up or down right or left without in the smallest degree altering the flatness or position of its stand  on looking through the telescope the delicate threads can be distinctly seen and the point where they cross can be brought to bear on any distant object  having fixed the instrument on the rocks quite clear of the ice the professor determined the direction of a supposed line perpendicular to the axis of the glacier  he then sought for a conspicuous and welldefined object on the opposite side of the valley as near as possible to that direction  in this he was greatly helped by captain wopper who having been long accustomed to lookout with precision at sea found it not very difficult to apply his powers on land  theres a good landmark professor he said pointing towards a sharplycut rock as like the dook of wellingtons nose as two peas  i see it said the professor whose solid and masculine countenance was just the smallest possible degree flushed by the strong undercurrent of enthusiasm with which he prosecuted his experiments  you couldnt have a better object than the pint o that observed the captain whose enthusiasm was quite as great as and his excitement much greater than that of the professor  having carefully directed the telescope to the extreme point of the dooks nose the professor now ordered one of his assistants to go on the glacier with a stake  lawrence descended with him and thus planted his foot on glacierice for the first time as lewis afterwards remarked in the pursuit scientific knowledge  while they were clambering slowly down among the loose boulders and debris which had been left by the glacier in previous years the professor carefully sketched the duke of wellingtons nose with the rocks etcetera immediately around it in his notebook so that it might be easily recognised again on returning to the spot on a future day  the assistant who had been sent out with the first stake proved to be rather stupid so that it was fortunate he had been accompanied by lawrence and by the guide antoine grennon who stirred up his perceptions  by rough signalling he was made to stand near the place where the first stake was to be driven in  the telescope was then lowered and the man was made by signals to move about and plant his stake here and there in an upright position until the point of intersection of the spiders threads fell exactly on the bottom of the stake  a prearranged signal was then made and at that point an auger hole was bored deep into the ice and the stake driven home  so much for number one said captain wopper with a look of satisfaction  they wont fix the other ones so easily observed the professor reexamining the stake through the telescope with great care  he was right in this  the first stake had been planted not far from the shore but now lawrence and his party had to proceed in a straight line over the glacier which at this steep portion of its descent into the vale of chamouni was rent dislocated and tortured to such an extent that it was covered with huge blocks and pinnacles of ice and seamed with yawning crevasses  to clamber over some of the iceridges was almost impossible and in order to avoid pinnacles and crevasses which were quite impassable frequent detours had to be made  if the object of the iceparty had merely been to cross the glacier the difficulties would not have been great but the necessity of always returning to the straight line pointed out by the inexorable theodolite led them into positions of considerable difficulty  to the inexperienced lawrence they also appeared to be positions of great danger much to the amusement of antoine who accustomed as he was to the fearful iceslopes and abysses of the higher regions looked upon this work as mere childs play  youll come to have a different notion of crevasses sir he said with a quiet smile after youve bin among the seracs of the grand mulet and up some of the couloirs of monte rosa  i doubt it not antoine said lawrence gazing with feelings of awe into a terrible split in the ice whose beautiful lightblue sides deepened into intense blackness as they were lost to vision in an abyss out of which arose the deeptoned gurgling of subglacial streams but you must not forget that this is quite new to me and my feet are not yet aware of the precise grip with which they must hold on to so slippery a foundation  it was in truth no discredit to lawrence that he felt a tendency to shrink from edges of chasms which appeared ready to break off or walked with caution on iceslopes which led to unfathomable holes for the said slopes although not steep were undoubtedly slippery  after much clambering a ridge was at length gained on which the second stake was set up and then the party proceeded onwards to fix the third but now the difficulties proved to be greater than before  a huge block of ice was fixed upon as that which would suit their purpose but it stood like a peninsula in the very midst of a crevasse and connected with the main body of ice by a neck which looked as sharp as a knife on its upper edge so that none but tightrope or slackwire dancers could have proceeded along it and even such performers would have found the edge too brittle to sustain them  youll have to show monsieur some of your mountaineer skill here said the man who carried the stakes to antoine  he spoke in french which lawrence understood perfectly  we render it as nearly as possible into the counterpart english  antoine at once stepped forward with his alpine axe and swinging it vigorously over his head cut a deep notch on the sloping side of the neck of ice  beyond it he cut a second notch  no mannot even a monkeycould have stood on the glassy slope which descended into the abyss at their side but antoine putting one foot in the first notch and the other in the second stood as secure as if he had been on a flat rock  again he swung his axe and planted his foot in a third notch swinging his axe the instant it was fixed for the purpose of cutting the fourth  thus cut by cut and step by step he passed over to the block of ice aimed at  it was but a short neck  a few notches were sufficient yet without an axe to cut these notches the place had been absolutely impassable  it was by no means a dangerous place according to the ideas of alpine mountaineers nevertheless a slip or the loss of balance would have been followed by contain death  antoine knew this and like a wise guide took proper precautions  stay sir he said as lawrence was screwing up his courage to follow him i will show you another piece of alpine practice  he returned as he spoke and unwinding a coil of rope which he carried fastened one end thereof round his waist  allowing a few feet of interval he then fastened the rope round lawrences waist and the assistants with the stakesof whom there were two besides the man already referred toalso attached themselves to the rope in like manner  by this means they all passed over with comparative security because if any one of them had chanced to slip the others would have fixed the points of their axes and alpenstocks in the ice and held on until their overbalanced comrade should have been restored to his position  on gaining the block however it was found that the line communicating with the theodolite on the one hand and the dooks nose on the other just missed it  the professors signals continued to indicate more to the left his left that is until the stakedriver stood on the extreme edge of the crevasse and his comrades held on tight by the rope to prevent him from falling over  still the professor indicated more to the left  as more to the left implied the planting of the stake in atmospheric air they were fain to search for a suitable spot farther on  this they found after some scrambling on a serrated ridge whose edge was just wide and strong enough to sustain them  here the exact line was marked but while the hole was being bored an ominous crack was heard ascending as if from the heart of the glacier  what was that said lawrence turning to the guide with a quick surprised look  only a split in the ice somewhere  its a common sound enough as you might expect in a mass that is constantly moving replied antoine looking gravely round him but i cant help thinking that this lump of ice with crevasses on each side is not the best of all spots for fixing a stake  it isnt solid enough  as he spoke another crash was heard not quite so loud as the last and at the same moment the whole mass on which the party stood slid forward a few inches  it seemed as if it were about to tumble into the very jaws of the crevasse  with the natural instinct of selfpreservation strong upon him lawrence darted across the narrow ridge to the firm ice in rear dispensing entirely with that extreme caution which had marked his first passage over it  indeed the tightrope and slackwire dancers formerly referred to could not have performed the feat with greater lightness rapidity and precision  the stakedrivers followed him with almost similar alacrity  even the guide retraced his steps without further delay than was necessary to permit of his picking up the stakes which their proper custodians had left behind in their alarmfor they were not guides merely young and inexperienced porters  for shame lads said antoine laughing and shaking his head youll be but bad specimens of the men of chamouni if you dont learn more coolness on the ice  one would have thought that coolness on the ice was an almost unavoidable consequence of the surrounding conditions yet lawrence seemed to contradict the idea for his face appeared unusually warm as he laughed and said  the shame lies with me antoine for i set them the example and all history goes to prove that even brave men are swept away under the influence of a panic which the act of one cowardly man may produce  as lawrence spoke in french the porters understood and appreciated his defence of them but antoine would by no means encourage the fallacy  it is not cowardly sir he said to spring quickly out of a danger that one dont understand the nature of but the young men of chamouni have or ought to have a good understanding of the nature of ice and the danger should be great indeed that would necessitate the leaving of their tools behind them  a roar like that of a bull of bashan or a boatswain here interrupted the conversation  dont plant your post therrre shouted captain wopper from the banks of the iceriver the professor says the ice aint firm enough heave aheadto where its haaard an faaast  ay ay sir shouted lawrence with nautical brevity in reply  the next stake was accordingly fixed on a part of the ice which was obviously incapable of what might be called a local slip and which must if it moved at all do so in accordance with the movements of the entire glacier  thus one by one the stakes were planted in a perfectly straight line so that when captain wopper was requested by the professor to look through the telescopewhich he did with a seamans readiness and precisionhe observed that all the stakes together appeared to form but one stake the bottom of which was touched on one side of the mer de glace by the centrepoint of the crossed threads and on the other by the extreme point of the dook of wellingtons nose  the last stake had been fixed not many yards distant from the opposite bank of the glacier  now said the professor with a deep sigh of satisfaction when all this was accomplished and noted we will go have our luncheon and return hither tomorrow to observe the result of our experiments  but first we must fix the exact position of our theodolite for unless it occupies to a hairsbreadth tomorrow the same position which it occupies today the result will be quite inconclusive  so saying the man of science took a little line and plummet from his pocket which he hung under the theodolite and the spot where the plummet touched the ground was carefully marked by a small stake driven quite down to its head  thereafter an attempt was made to gather together the scattered party but this was difficult  owing to various causes several members of it had become oblivious of time  emma had forgotten time in the pursuit of wildflowers of which she was excessively fond partly because she had learned to press and classify and write their proper names under them but chiefly because they were intrinsically lovely and usually grew in the midst of beautiful scenery  nita had forgotten it in the pursuit of emma of whom she had become suddenly and passionately fond partly because she possessed a loving nature but chiefly because emma was her counterpart  lewis had forgotten it in pursuit of nita of whom he had become extremely fond partly because she was pretty and pert but chiefly because hehewell we cannot say precisely why seeing that he did not inform us and did not himself appear clearly to know slingsby had forgotten it in the ardent effort to reproduce on paper and with pencil a scene so magnificent that a brush dipped in the rainbow and applied by claude or turner would have utterly failed to do it justice and last as well as least gillie white had forgotten it in the pursuit of general knowledge in which pursuit he had used his alpenstock effectively in opening up everything stabbing knocking down uprooting overturning and generally shattering everything that was capable of being in any degree affected by the physical powers and forces at his command  there can be no doubt whatever that if gillie white had been big and strong enough mont blanc itself would have succumbed that day to his inquiring mind and the greatest icereservoir of europe would have been levelled with the plain  as it was he merely levelled himself after reaching the point of exhaustion and went to sleep on the sunny side of a rock where he was nearly roasted alive before being aroused by the shouts of captain wopper  at last however the party assembled at the montanvert where amid interjectional accounts of the various incidents and adventures of the forenoon strength was recruited for the subsequent operations of the day  these however were only matters of amusement  the professor remarking jocosely that he now cast science to the dogs and cats which latter he pronounced cawts sent his instruments back to chamouni and with the zest of a big boy let loose from school crossed the mer de glace to the chapeau  this feat was by no means so difficult as that which had been accomplished by lawrence  it will be remembered that the spot selected for measurement had been at the steep and rugged part of the iceriver styled the glacier des bois below the montanvert  the ordinary crossingplace lay considerably higher up just opposite to the inn the track had been marked out over the easiest and flattest part of the ice and levelled here and there where necessary for the special benefit of tourists  still maneven when doing his worst in the way of making rough places plain and robbing nature of some of her romancecould not do much to damage the grandeur of that impressive spot  his axe only chipped a little of the surface and made the footing secure  it could not mar the beauty of the picturesque surroundings or dim the suns glitter on the icepinnacles or taint the purity of these delicate blue depths into which emma and nita gazed for the first time with admiration and surprise while they listened to the mysterious murmurings of subglacial waters with mingled feelings of curiosity and awe  full of interest they traversed the grand unfathomable river of ice the product of the compressed snows of innumerable wintersand reaching the other side in less than an hour descended the chapeau through the terminal moraine  those who have not seen it can form but a faint conception of the stupendous mass of debris which is cut torn wrenched carried swept hurled rolled crushed and ground down by a glacier from the mountainheights into the plain below  the terminal moraine of the mer de glace is a whole valley whose floor and sides are not only quite but deeply covered with rocks of every shape and size from a pebble the size of a pea to a boulder as large as a cottage all strewn piled and heaped together in a wild confusion that is eminently suggestive of the mighty force which cast them there  to me there do seem something dreadful as well as grand in it said nita as she sat down on a boulder beside emma near the lower end of the chaotic valley  it is indeed terrible answered emma and fills me with wonder when i think that frozen water possesses power so stupendous  and yet the same element said the professor which when frozen thus rends the mountains with force irresistible when melted flows through the land in gentle fertilising streams  in both forms its power is most wonderful  like that of him who created it said emma in a low tone  the party stood on the margin of a little pond or lakelet that had collected in the midst of the debris and which by reflecting the clear sky and their figures with several large boulders on its margin gave point and a measure of softness to the otherwise confused and rugged scene  while they stood and sat rapt in silent contemplation of the tongue of the mer de glace at whose tip was the blue icecave whence issued the arveiron a lordly eagle rose from a neighbouring cliff and soared grandly over their heads while a bright gleam of the sinking sun shot over the white shoulders of mont blanc and lit up the higher end of the valley throwing the lower part into deeper shade by contrast  there is a warning to us said lewis whose chief interest in the scene lay in the reflection of it that gleamed from nita horetzkis eyes  which is the warning asked slingsby the gleam of sunshine or the eagle  both for while the sun is going to bed behind the snow the eagle is doubtless going home to her eyrie and antoine tells me that it is full three miles from this spot to our hotel in chamouni  it did not take them long to traverse that space and ere long like the eagle and the sun the whole party had retired to restthe younger members doubtless to dreamless slumber the professor and the captain probably to visions of theodolites and ice  although however these worthies must needs await the coming day to have their scientific hopes realised it would be cruel to keep our patient reader in suspense  we may therefore note here that when on the following day the theodolite was refixed and the man of science and his amateur friend had applied their respective eyes to the telescope they were assured beyond a doubt that the stakes had moved some more and some less while the dooks nose of course remained hard and fast as the rock of which it was composed  the stakes had descended from about one to three feet during the twentyfour hours those near the edge having moved least and those near the centre of the icerivers flow having moved farthest  of course there was a great deal of observing with the theodolite and careful measuring as well as scrambling on the ice similar to that of the previous day but the end of the whole was that the glacier was ascertained to have flowed definitely and observably down its channel there could be no doubt whatever about that the thing had been clearly proved therefore the professor was triumphant and the captain being a reasonable man was convinced    chapter twelve  in which gillie is sagacious an excursion is undertaken wondrous sights are seen and avalanches of more kinds than one are encountered  susan said gillie one morning entering the private apartment of mrs stoutleys maid with the confidence of a privileged friend flinging himself languidly into a chair and stretching out his little legs with the air of a rather usedup though by no means discontented man susan this is a coorious worldwery cooriousthe most coorious i may say that i ever come across  i wont speak a word to you gillie said susan firmly unless you throw that cigar out of the window  ah susan you would not rob me of my mornin weed would you remonstrated gillie puffing a long cloud of smoke from his lips as he took from between them the end of a cigar that had been thrown away by some one the night before  yes i would child you are too young to smoke  child repeated gillie in a tone of reproach too young  why susan theres only two years between you an methat aint much you know at our time of life  well what then  i dont smoke said susan  true returned gillie with an approving nod and to say truth im pleased to find that you dont  its a nasty habit in women  its an equally nasty habit in boys  now do as i bid you directly  when a man is told by the girl he loves to do anythink he is bound to do iteven if it wor the sheddin of his blood  susan your word is law  he turned and tossed the cigarend out of the window  susan laughingly stooped kissed the urchins forehead and called him a good boy  now said she what do you mean by sayin that this is a curious world  do you refer to this part of it or to the whole of it  well for the matter of that replied gillie crossing his legs and folding his hands over his knee as he looked gravely up in susans pretty face i means the whole of it this part included and the people in it likewise  dont suppose that i go for to exclude myself were all coorious every one on us  what me too  you wy you are the cooriousest of us all susan seeing that youre only a ladysmaid when youre pretty enough to have been a ladya dutchess in fact or somethin o that sort  you are an impudent little thing retorted susan with a laugh but tell me what do you find so curious about the people upstairs  why for one thing they seem all to have falled in love  thats not very curious is it said susan quietly its common enough anyhow  ah some kinds of it yes returned gillie with the air of a philosopher but at chamouni the disease appears to have become viroolent an pecoolier  theres the cappn hes falled in love wi the professor an it seems to me that the attachment is mootooal  then mister lewis has falled in love with madmysell nita hooraytskie thats a sneezer aint it an the mad artist as mister lewis call him has falled in love with her too poor feller an miss nita has falled in love with miss emma an miss emma besides reciprocatin that passion has falled in love with the flowers and the scenerygone in for it wholesale so to speakand dr lawrence he seems to have falled in love with everybody all round anyhow everybody has falled in love with him for hes continually goin about doin little good turns wherever he gits the chance without seemin to intend it or shovin hisself to the front  in fact i do think he dont intend it but only cant help it just the way he used to be to my old mother and the rest of us in grubbs court  and i say susan here gillie looked very mysterious and dropped his voice to a whisper miss emma has falled in love with him  nonsense child how is it possible that you can tell that said susan  the boy nodded his head with a look of preternatural wisdom and put his forefinger to the side of his nose  ah said he yes i cant explain how it is that i knows it but i do know it  bless you susan i can see through a fourinch plank in thick weather without the aid of a gimlet hole  you may believe it or not but i know that miss emma has falled in love with dr lawrence but whether dr lawrence has failed in love with miss emma is more than i can tell  that plank is at least a sixinch one an too much for my wision  but have a care susan dont mention wot ive said to a single soullivin or dead  miss emma is a modest young woman she is an would rather eat her fingers off rings and all than let her feelins be known  i see that cause she fights shy o dr lawrence rather too shy of im i fear for secrecy  why he doesnt make up to her is a puzzle that i dont understand for shed make a good wife would miss emma an dr lawrence may live to repent of it if he dont go in and win  susan looked with mingled surprise and indignation at the precocious little creature who sat before her giving vent to his opinions as coolly as if he were a middleaged man  after contemplating him for a few moments in silence she expressed her belief that he was a conceited little imp to venture to speak of his young mistress in that way  i wouldnt do it to any one but yourself susan he said in no wise abashed an i hope you appreciate my confidence  dont talk such nonsense child but go on with what you were speaking about rejoined susan with a smile to conceal which she bent down her head as she plied her needle briskly on one of emmas mountaintorn dresses  well where was i continued gillie ah yes  then lord whatsisname hes falled in love with the mountaintops an is for ever tryin to get at em in which he would succeed for hes a plucky young feller if it wornt for that snobwhos got charge of immister lumbardwhose pecooliarity lies in preferrin every wrong road to the right one  as i heard mr lewis say the other day wen i chanced to be passin the keyhole of the sallymanjay hed raither go up to the roof of a ouse by the waterspout than the staircase just for the sake of boastin of it  and is mr lumbard in love with any one asked susan  of course he is answered gillie hes in love with hisself  hes always talkin of hisself an praisin hisself an boastin of hisself an what hes done and agoin to do  hes plucky enough no doubt and if there wor a lightninconductor runnin to top of mount blang i do blieve hed try totolead his lordship up that but hes too fond of talkin an swaggerin about with his big axe an wearin a coil of rope on his shoulder when he aint goin nowhere  bah  i dont like him  what do you think susan i met him on the road the other evenin wen takin a stroll by myself down near the glassyer day bossong an i says to him quite in a friendly way bong joor says i which is french you know an what the natives here says when theyre in good humour an want to say goodday all serene how are you off for soap an suchlike purlitenesses  well would you believe it he went past without takin no notice of me whatsumdever  how very impolite said susan and what did you do  do cried gillie drawing himself up why i cocked my nose in the air and walked on without disdainin to say another wordtreated im with suvrin contempt  but enough of himan more than enough  well to continue then theres missis stoutley shes falled in love too  indeed  yes with wittles  the count hurwhatsisname whos always doin the purlite when hes not mopin says its the mountain hair as is agreein with her but i think its the hairsoup  anyhow shes more friendly with her wittles here than she ever was in england  after comin in from that excursion where them two stout fellers carried her up the mountains an all but capsized her and themselves incloodin the chair down a precipice while passin a string o mules on a track no broader than the brim of mister slingsbys wideawake she took to her wittles with a sort of lovin awidity that ant describable  the way she shovelled in the soup an stowed away the mutton chops an pitched into the pease and taters to say nothing of cauliflower and cutlets was a caution to the billions  it made my mouth water to look at her an my eyes tooonly that may have had somethin to do with the keyhole for them otels of chamouni are oncommon draughty  yes continued gillie slowly as if he were musing shes failed in love with wittles an its by no means a misplaced affection  it would be well for the count if he could fall in the same direction  did you ever look steadily at the count susan  i cant say i ever did at least not more so than at other people why  because if you ever do look at him steadily youll see care asittin wery heavy on his long yeller face  theres somethin the matter with that count either in is head or is stummick i aint sure which but whichever it is it has descended to his darter for that gals face is too anxious by half for such a young and pretty one  i have quite a sympathy a sort o fellerfeelin for that count  he seems to me the wictim of a secret sorrow  susan looked at her small admirer with surprise and then burst into a hearty laugh  youre a queer boy gillie  to an unsophisticated country girl like susan quick the london streetboy must indeed have seemed a remarkable being  he was not indeed an absolute arab being the son of an honest hardworking mother but being also the son of a drunken illdoing father he had in the course of an extensive experience of bringing his paternal parent home from ginpalaces and low theatres imbibed a good deal of the superficial part of the waif character and but for the powerful and benign influence of his mother might have long ago entered the ranks of our criminal population  as it was he had acquired a knowledge of the world of londonits thoughts feelings and mannerswhich rendered him in susans eyes a perfect miracle of intelligence and she listened to his drolleries and precocious wisdom with openmouthed admiration of course the urchin was quite aware of this and plumed himself not a little on his powers of attraction  yes continued gillie without remarking on susans observation that he was a queer boy for he esteemed that a compliment the count is the only man among em who hasnt falled in love with nothink or nobody but tell me susan is your fair buzzum free from thethe tender you know what  oh yes laughed the maid quite free  ah said gillie with a sigh of satisfaction then theres hope for me  of course there is plenty of hope said susan laughing still more heartily as she looked at the thing in blue and buttons which thus addressed her  but now tell me where are they talking of going today  to the jardang replied gillie  it was putt off to please the young ladies tother day and now its putt on to please the professor  it seems to me that the professor has got well to windard of em allas the cappen would say he can twirl the whole bilin of em round his little finger with his outlandish talk which i believe is more than half nonsense  howsever hes goin to take em all to the jardang to lunch there an make some more obserwations and measurements of the ice  why he takes so much trouble about sitch a trifle beats my understandin  if the ice is six feet or six hundred feet thick what then  if it moves or if it dont move wots the odds so long as yer appy  if it wont move wy dont they send for a company of london bobbies and make em tell it to move on it couldnt refuse you know for nothin can resist that  howsever they are all goin to foller the lead of the professor again todaythem that was with em last timenot the count though for i heard him say much to the distress apperiently of his darter that he was goin on business to marteeny over the tait nwar though what that is i dont knowa mountain i suppose  theyre all keen for goin over things in this country an some of em goes under altogether in the doin of it  if i aint mistaken that pleasant fate awaits lord whatsisname an mr lumbard for i heard the cappen sayin just afore i come to see you that he was goin to take his lordship to the main truck of mount blang by way of the signal halliards in preference to the regular road  are the young ladies going asked susan  of course they are from wich it follers that mr lewis an the mad artist are goin too  and mrs stoutley asked susan  no its much too far and difficult for her  gillie gillie shouted a stentorian voice at this point in the conversation  ay ay cappen yelled gillie in reply  rising and thrusting his hands into his pockets he sauntered leisurely from the room recommending the captain in an undertone to save his wind for the mountainside  not long afterwards the same parties that had accompanied the professor to the montanvert were toiling up the mer de glace at a considerable distance above the scene of their former exploits on their way to the jardin  the day was all that could be desired  there were a few clouds but these were light and feathery clear blue predominated all over the sky over the masses of the jorasses and the peaks of the geant the aiguille du dru the slopes of mont mallet the pinnacles of charmoz and the rounded white summit of mont blanceverywherethe heavens were serene and beautiful  the jardin towards which they ascended lies like an island in the midst of the glacier du talefre  it is a favourite expedition of travellers being a verdant gem on a field of whitea true oasis in the desert of ice and snowand within a five hours walk of chamouni  their route lay partly on the moraines and partly over the surface of the glacier  on their previous visit to the mer de glace those of the party to whom the sight was new imagined that they had seen all the wonders of the glacier world  they were soon undeceived  while at the montanvert on their first excursion they could turn their eyes from the sea of ice to the treeclad slopes behind them and at the chapeau could gaze on a splendid stretch of the vale of chamouni to refresh their eyes when wearied with the rugged cataract of the glacier des bois but as they advanced slowly up into the icy solitudes all traces of the softer world were lost to view  only ice and snow lay around them  ice under foot ice on the cliffs ice in the mountain valleys ice in the higher gorges and snow on the summitsexcept where these latter were so sharp and steep that snow could not find a lodgment  there was nothing in all the field of vision to remind them of the vegetable world from which they had passed as if by magic  as lewis remarked they seemed to have been suddenly transported to within the arctic circle and got lost among the icemountains of spitzbergen or nova zembla  it is magnificent exclaimed nita horetzki with enthusiasm as she paused on the summit of an iceridge up the slippery sides of which she had been assisted by antoine grennon who still held her little hand in his  ah thoughtless man he little knew what daggers of envy were lacerating the heart of the mad artist who would have given all that he possessed colourbox and campstool includedto have been allowed to hold that little hand even for a few seconds  indeed he had in a fit of desperation offered to aid her by taking the other hand when halfway up that very slope but had slipped at the moment of making the offer and rolled to the bottom  lewis seeing the fate of his rival wisely refrained from putting himself in a false position by offering any assistance excusing his apparent want of gallantry by remarking that if he were doomed to slip into a crevasse he should prefer not to drag another along with him  antoine therefore had the little hand all to himself  the professor being a somewhat experienced iceman assisted emma in all cases of difficulty  as for the captain gillie and lawrence they had quite enough to do to look after themselves  how different from what i had expected said emma resting a hand on the shoulder of nita it is a very landscape of ice  emmas simile was not farfetched  they had reached a part of the glacier where the slope and the configuration of the valley had caused severe strains on the ice in various directions so that there were not only transverse crevasses but longitudinal cracks which unitedly had cut up the ice into blocks of all shapes and sizes  these as their position shifted had become isolated more or lessand being partially melted by the sun had assumed all sorts of fantastic shapes there were icebridges icecaves and ice obelisks and spires some of which latter towered to a height of fifty feet or more there were also forms suggestive of cottages and trees with here and there real rivulets rippling down their icy beds or leaping over pale blue ledges or gliding into bluegreen lakes or plunging into blackblue chasms the sunlight playing among these silvery realmsglinting over edges and peaks blazing on broad masses shimmering through semitransparent cliffs and casting soft grey shadows everywherewas inexpressibly beautiful while the whole looming through a thin golden haze seemed to be of gigantic proportions  it seemed as if the region of ice around them must at one time have been in tremendous convulsions but the professor assured them that this was not the case that the formation of crevasses and those confused heaps of ice called seracs was a slow and prolonged process  doubtless he said you have here and there the wild rush of avalanches and suchlike convulsions but the rupture of the great body of the ice is gradual  a crevasse is an almost invisible crack at first  it yawns slowly and takes a long time to open out to the dimensions and confusion which you see around  what are those curious things asked nita pointing to some forms before her  they look like giant mushrooms said captain wopper  they are icetables answered antoine  blocks of stone on the top of cones of ice said the professor come we will go near and examine one  the object in question was well suited to cause surprise for it was found to be an enormous flat mass of rock many tons in weight perched on a pillar of ice and bearing some resemblance to a table with a central leg  now said captain wopper emphatically that is a puzzler  how did it ever get up there  i have read of such tables said lawrence  they are the result of the suns action i believe  oh its all very well lawrence said lewis with a touch of sarcasm to talk in a vague way about the suns action but its quite plain even to an unphilosophical mind like mine that the sun cant lift a block of stone some tons in weight and clap it on the top of a pillar of ice about ten feet high  nevertheless the sun has done it returned lawrence  am i not right professor  the man of science who had listened with a bland smile on his broad countenance admitted that lawrence was right  at first he said that big stone fell from the cliffs higher up the valley and it has now been carried down thus far by the ice  during its progress the sun has been shining day by day and melting the surface of the ice all round with the exception of that part which was covered by the rock  thus the general level of the ice has been lowered and the protected portion left prominent with its protector on the top  the sides of the block of ice on which the rock has rested have also melted slowly reducing it to the stalk or pillar which you now see  in time it will melt so much that the rock will slide off fall on another part of the ice which it will protect from the sun as before until another stem shall support it and thus it will go on until it tumbles into a crevasse reaches the under part of the glacier perhaps there gets rolled and rounded into a boulder and finally is discharged many years hence it may be into the terminal moraine or perchance it may get stranded on the sides of the valley among the debris or rubbish which we call the lateral moraine  as the party advanced new and if possible still more striking objects met the eye while mysterious sounds struck the ear  low grumbling noises and gurglings were heard underfoot as if great boulders were dropping into buried lakes from the roofs of subglacial caverns while on the surface the glacier was strewn here and there with debris which had fallen from steep parts of the mountains that rose beside them into the clouds  sudden rushing soundsas if of shortlived squalls in the midst of which were crashes like the thunder of distant artillerybegan now to attract attention and a feeling of awe crept into the hearts of those of the party who were strangers to the iceworld  sounds of unseen avalanches muffled more or less according to distance were mingled with what may be called the shots of the boulders which fell almost every five minutes from the aiguille verte and other mountains and there was something deeply impressive in the solemn echoes that followed each deeptoned growl and were repeated until they died out in soft murmurs  as the party crossed an iceplain whose surface was thickly strewn with the wreck of mountains a sense of insecurity crept into the feelings of more than one member of it but not a word was said until a sudden and tremendous crash followed by a continuous roar was heard close at hand  an avalanche shouted slingsby pointing upwards and turning back with the evident intention to fly  it did indeed seem the wisest thing that man or woman could do in the circumstances for high up among the wild cliffs huge masses of rock mingled with ice dirt water and snow were seen rushing down a couloir or steep gully straight towards them  rest tranquil where you are said the guide laying his hand on the artists arm the couloir takes a bend you see near the bottom there is no danger  thus assured the whole of the party stood still and gazed upward  owing to the great height from which the descending mass was pouring the inexperienced were deceived as to the dimensions of the avalanche it seemed at first as if the boulders were too small to account for the sounds created but in a few seconds their real proportions became more apparent especially when the whole rush came straight towards the spot on which the travellers stood with such an aspect of being fraught with inevitable destruction that all of them except the guide shrank involuntarily backwards  at this crisis the chaotic mass was driven with terrible violence against the cliffs to the left of the couloir and bounding we might almost say fiercely to the right rushed out upon the frozen plain about two hundred yards in advance of the spot on which they stood  is there not danger in being so close to such places asked lewis glancing uneasily at nita whose flashing eyes and heightened colour told eloquently of the excitement which the sight had aroused in her breast  not much answered the professor no doubt we cannot be said to be in a place of absolute safety nevertheless the danger is not great because we can generally observe the avalanches in time to get out of the way of spent shots and besides if we run under the lea of such boulders as that we are quite safe unless it were to be hit by one pretty nearly as large as itself  he pointed as he spoke to a mass of granite about the size of an omnibus which lay just in front of them but i see he added laughing that antoine thinks this is not a suitable place for the delivery of lectures we must hasten forward  soon they surmounted the steeps of the glacier du talefre and reached the object of their desire the jardin  it is well named  a wonderful spot of earth and rock which rises out of the midst of a great basin of halfformed ice the lower part being covered with green sward and spangled with flowers while the summit of the rock forms a splendid outlook from which to view the surrounding scene  here seated on the soft grassthe green of which was absolutely delicious to the eyes after the long walk over the glaring icethe jovial professor with a sandwich in one hand and a flask of vin ordinaire in the other descanted on the world of ice  he had a willing audience for they were all too busy with food to use their tongues in speech except in making an occasional brief demand or comment  glorious exclaimed the professor  which the view or the victuals asked lewis  both cried the professor helping himself to another halfdozen sandwiches  thank youno more at present said nita to the disappointed slingsby who placed the rejected limb of a fowl on his own plate with a deep sigh  professor said nita halfturning her back on the afflicted artist how when and where be all this ice formed  a comprehensive question cried the professor  thank youyes a wing and a leg also if you can spare it a piece of theah so you are right  the whole fowl is best  i can then help myself  miss gray shall i assist you to ano  well as i was about to remark in reply to your comprehensive question mademoiselle this basin in which our jardin lies may be styled a mighty collector of the material which forms that great tributary of the mer de glace named the glacier du talefre  this material is called neve  an whats nevy asked captain wopper as well as a full mouth would allow him  neve replied the professor is snow altered by partial melting and freezing and compressionsnow in the process of being squeezed into ice  you must know that there is a line on all high mountains which is called the snowline  above this line the snow that falls each year never disappears below it the snow and ice too undergoes the melting process continually  the portion below the snowline is always being diminished that above it is always augmenting thus the loss of the one is counterbalanced by the gain of the other and thus the continuity of glaciers is maintained  that part of a glacier which lies above the snowline is styled neve it is the fountainhead and source of supply to the glacier proper which is the part that lies below the snowline  sometimes for a series of years perhaps the supply from above is greater than the diminution below the result being that the snout of a glacier advances into its valley ploughs up the land and sometimes overturns the cottages  see note 1 on the other hand the reverse process goes on it may be for years and a glacier recedes somewhat leaving a whole valley of debris or terminal moraine which is sometimes after centuries perhaps clothed with vegetation and dotted with cottages  this basin or collector of neve on whose beautiful oasis i have the felicity to lunch in such charming society the jovial professor bowed to the ladies is according to your talented professor forbes he bowed to lawrence about four thousand two hundred yards wide and all the ice it contains is farther down squeezed through a gorge not more than seven hundred yards wide thus forming that grand icecascade of the talefre which you have seen on the way hither  it is a splendid as well as interesting amphitheatre for it is bounded as you see on one side by the grandes jorasses on the other by mont mallet while elsewhere you have the vast plateau whence the glacier du geant is fed the aiguille du geant the aiguille noire the montagnes mandites and mont blanc  another wing if you pleaseah finished  no matter pass the loaf  it will do as well  the professor devoted himself for some minutes in silence to the loaf which was much shorn of its proportions on leaving his hand  like many great men he was a great eater  the fires of intellect that burned within him seemed to require a more than ordinary supply of fuel  he slept too like an infant hercules and as a natural consequence toiled like a giant when awake  little gillie white regarded him with feelings of undisguised awe astonishment and delight and was often sorely perplexed within himself as to whether he or captain wopper was the greater man  both were colossal in size and energetic in body and both were free and easy in manners as well as goodhumoured  no doubt as gillie argued with himself and sometimes with susan the professor was uncommon larned an deep but then the captain had a humorous vein which fully counterbalanced that in gillies estimation  the philosophic urchin was deeply engaged in debating this point with himself and gazing openmouthed at the professor when there suddenly occurred an avalanche so peculiar and destructive that it threw the whole party into the utmost consternation  while removing a pile of plates gillie in his abstraction tripped on a stone tumbled over the artist crushed that gentlemans head into nitas lap and descending head foremost plates and all into the midst of the feast scattered very moraine of crockery and bottles all round  it was an appalling smash and when the captain seized gillie by the back of his trousers with one hand and lifted him tenderly out of the midst of the debris the limp way in which he hung suggested the idea that a broken bottle must have penetrated his vitals and finished him  it was not so however  gillies sagacity told him that he would probably be wounded if he were to move  he wisely therefore remained quite passive and allowed himself to be lifted out of danger  nobody hurt i ope he said on being set on his legs it was a awkard plunge  awkard you blue spider cried the captain you deserve to be keelhauled or pitched into a crevasse  look alive now an clear up the mess youve made  fortunately the feast was about concluded when this contretemps occurred so that no serious loss was sustained  some of the gentlemen lighted their pipes and cigars to solace themselves before commencing the return journey  the ladies went off to saunter and to botanise and slingsby attempted to sketch the scenery  and here again as on the previous excursion captain wopper received a chill in regard to his matrimonial hopes  when the ladies rose lewis managed to engage nita in an interesting conversation on what he styled the flora of central europe and led her away  emma was thus left without her companion  now thought the captain theres your chance dr lawrence go in and win  but lawrence did not avail himself of the chance  he suffered emma to follow her friend and remained behind talking with the professor on the vexed subject of the cause of glacial motion  most extraornary thought the captain somewhat nettled as well as disappointed  what can the youngster mean  shes as sweet a gal as a fellow would wish to see an yet he dont pay no more attention to her than if she was an old bumboat ooman  very odd  cant make it out nohow  captain wopper was not the first and will certainly not be the last to experience difficulty in accounting for the conduct of young men and maidens in this world of crosscurrents and queer fancies    note 1  such is actually true at the present time of the gorner glacier which has for a long time been advancing and during the last sixty years or so has overturned between forty and fifty chalets    chapter thirteen  shows what dangers may be encountered in the pursuit of art and science  who has not experienced the almost unqualified pleasure of a walk on a bright beautiful morning before breakfast  how amply it repays one for the selfdenying misery of getting up  we say misery advisedly for it is an undoubted though shortlived agony that of arousing ones inert contented and peaceful frame into a state of activity  there is a moment in the daily life of manof some men at leastwhen heroism of a very high stamp is displayed that moment when the appointed hour of morning having arrived he thrusts one lethargic toe from under the warm bedclothes into the relatively cold atmosphere of his chamber  if the toe is drawn back the man is nobody  if it is thrust further out and followed up by the unwilling body the man is a hero  the agony however like that of toothdrawing is soon over and the delightful commendations of an approving conscience are superadded to the pleasures of an early morning walk  such pleasures were enjoyed one morning by emma gray and nita horetzki and lewis stoutley when at an early hour they issued from their hotel and walked away briskly up the vale of chamouni  i say emma isnt it a charming delicious and outrageously delightful day exclaimed lewis  although the young man addressed himself to his cousin who walked on his left he glanced at nita who walked on his right and thus with a sense of justice peculiarly his own divided his attentions equally between them  you are unusually enthusiastic cousin said emma with a laugh  i thought you said last night that weather never affected you  true but there is more than weather here there is scenery andand sunshine  sunshine repeated nita lifting her large orbs to his face with a look of surprise for although the sun may be said to have risen as regards the world at large it had not yet surmounted the range of mont blanc or risen to the inhabitants of chamouni  i not see it where is the sunshine  there exclaimed lewis mentally as he gazed straight down into her wondering orbs and then added aloud as he swept his arm aloft with a mockheroic air behold it gleaming on the mountainridges  there is no doubt that the enthusiasm of lewis as to the weather scenery and sunshine would have been much reduced perhaps quenched altogether if nita had not been there for the youth was steeped in that exquisite condition termed first lovethe very torments incident to which are moderated joysbut it must not be supposed that he conducted himself with the maudlin sentimentality not unfrequently allied to that condition  although a mischievous and we are bound to admit a reckless youth he was masculine in his temperament and capable of being deeply though not easily stirred into enthusiasm  it was quite in accordance with this nature that his jesting tone and manner suddenly vanished as his gaze became riveted on the ridge to which he had carelessly directed attention  even nita was for a moment forgotten in the sight that met his eyes for the trees and bushes which crowned the ridge were to all appearance composed of solid fire  did you ever see anything like that before emma he asked eagerly  never i have seen sunrises and sunsets in many parts of our own land but nothing at all like that what can be the cause of it  there was good reason for the wonder thus called forth for the light was not on the trees but behind them  the sun had not quite risen but was very near the summit of the ridge so that these trees and bushes were pictured as it were against the brightest part of the glowing sky  in such circumstances we are taught by ordinary experience that objects will be unusually dark but these trees were incomparably brighter than the glowing sky itself  it was not that their mere edges were tipped with fire but their entire substance even to the central core of the pinestems was to all appearance made of pure light as if each tree and shrub had been made of steel raised to a condition of intense white heat  no shining of the sun through or upon trees can convey the slightest idea of the sight  it was something absolutely new to our travellers and roused their astonishment as well as wonder to the highest pitch  oh exclaimed nita clasping her hands with a force peculiar to her demonstrative nature how wonderful  how i do wish the professor was here to tell us how and what it be  that evening the professor who had observed the phenomenon more than once told them all he knew about it  there were differences of opinion he said as to the cause for men of physical science not less than doctors were prone to differ  for himself he had only noted the facts and knew not the cause  the luminous trees appeared only at that part of the ridge where the sun was just going to riseelsewhere the trees were projected as dark objects in the usual way against the bright sky  not only were the trees thus apparently selfluminous but when birds chanced to be flying amongst them they had the appearance of sparks of molten silver flitting to and fro  see note 1  but you have not yet told me ladies said lewis as they resumed their walk what has induced you to indulge in so early a ramble today  can you not imagine said nita that it is the love of nature  undoubtedly i can but as this is the first time since we came that you have chosen to display a love for nature before breakfast i may be forgiven for supposing there is another and no doubt secondary cause  you are right said emma were you not present last night when we discussed our plans for today  no he was in the verandah interposed nita with an arch smile indulging that savage and unintellectual taste you call smoking  ah mademoiselle be not too severe  it may not indeed be styled an intellectual pursuit but neither surely can it be called savage seeing that it softens and ameliorates the rugged spirit of man  it is savage returned nita because you do not encourage ladies to join you in it  pardon me mademoiselle cried lewis pulling out his cigarcase nothing would gratify me more than your acceptance of  insult me not monsieur said nita with a toss of her pretty little head but reply to your cousins question  ah to be sure welllet me see what was it  was i present when the plans for the day were arranged  yes i was but i missed the first part of the conversation having been as mademoiselle horetzki truly observes occupied with thata  savage habit interposed nita  savage habit said lewis the savage element of which i am willing to do away with at a moments notice when desired  i merely heard that the professor had fixed to go on the glacier for the purpose of measuring it as though it were a badly clad giant and he a scientific tailor who had undertaken to make a topcoat for it  i also heard that you two had decided on a walk before breakfast and not caring to do tailoring on the ice i begged leave to join youtherefore i am here  ah you prefer womans society and safety to manly exercise and danger said nita  although lewis was as we have said by no means an effeminate youth he was at that age when the male creature shrinks from the slightest imputation of a lack of manliness  he coloured therefore as he laughingly replied that in his humble opinion his present walk involved the manly exercise of moral courage in withstanding shafts of sarcasm which were far more dangerous in his eyes than hidden crevasses or flying boulders  but you both forget interposed emma that i have not yet explained the object of our morning walk  true cousin let us have it  well continued emma when you were engages in your savage indulgence a difficulty stood in the way of the professors plans inasmuch as our guide antoine had asked and obtained leave to absent himself a couple of days for the purpose of taking his wife and child over the country to pay a short visit to a relative in some valley the name of which i forget  antoine had said that he would be quite willing to give up his leave of absence if a messenger were sent to inform his wife of his change of plan and to ask a certain baptist le croix who lives close beside her to be her guide  as we two did not mean to join the iceparty we at once offered to be the messengers  hence our present expedition at so early an hour  after seeing madame antoine grennon and having breakfast we mean to spend the day in sketching  may i join you in this afterportion of the days work asked lewis i may not indeed claim to use the pencil with the facility of our friend slingsby but i am not altogether destitute of a little native talent in that way  i will promise to give you both as many cigars as you choose and will submit my sketches to mademoiselles criticism which will be incurring extreme danger  well you may come said nita with a condescending nod but pray fulfil the first part of your promise give me the cigars  lewis drew them out with alacrity and laughingly asked how many  all of them the case also  in some surprise the youth put the cigarcase into her hand and she immediately flung it into a neighbouring pool  ah how cruel said lewis putting on a most forlorn look while emma gave vent to one of her subdued little explosions of laughter  what is our society not enough for monsieur asked nita in affected surprise  more than enough replied lewis with affected enthusiasm  then you can be happy without your cigars returned nita  perfectly happy replied lewis taking a small case from his pocket from which he extracted a neat little meerschaum pipe and began to fill it with tobacco  again emma had occasion to open the safetyvalve of another little explosive laugh but before anything further could be said they came in sight of antoine grennons cottage  it was prettily situated beneath a clump of pines  a small stream spanned by a rustic bridge danced past it  under the shadow of the bridge they saw madame engaged in washing linen  she had a washingtub of course but instead of putting the linen into this she put herself in it after having made an island of it by placing it a few inches deep in the stream  thus she could kneel and get at the water conveniently without wetting her knees or skirts  on a sloping slab of wood she manipulated the linen with such instrumentality as cold water soap a wooden mallet and a hard brush  beside her in a miniature tub her little daughter conducted a miniature washing  the three travellers looking over the bridge could witness the operation without being themselves observed  it is a lively process remarked lewis as madame seized a mass of linen with great vigour and caused it to fall on the sloping plank with a sounding slap  madame was an exceedingly handsome and wellmade woman turned thirty and much inclined to embonpoint  her daughter was turned three and still more inclined to the same condition  their rounded wellshaped and muscular arms acted very much in the same way only madames vigour was a good deal more intense and persistenttoo much so perhaps for the fabrics with which she had to deal but if the said fabrics possessed the smallest degree of consciousness they could not have had the heart to complain of rough treatment from such neat though strong hands while being smiled upon by such a pretty though decisive countenance  it is dreadfully rough treatment said emma whose domesticeconomical spirit was rather shocked  terrible exclaimed nita as madame gripped another article of apparel and beat it with her mallet as though it had been the skull of her bitterest enemy while soapsuds and water spurted from it as if they had been that enemys brains  and she washes i believe for our hotel said emma with a slightly troubled expression  perhaps a thought of her workbox and buttons flashed across her mind at the moment  you are right said lewis with a pleased smile  i heard antoine say to gillie the other day that his wife washed a large portion of the hotel linen  no doubt some of ours is amongst it indeed i am sure of it he added with a look of quiet gravity as madame grennon seized another article swished it through the water caused it to resound on the plank and scrubbed it powerfully with soap that a whatsisname belongs to me  i know it by the cut of its collar  formerly i used to know it chiefly by its fair and fragile texture  i shall know it hereafter as an amazing illustration of the truth of the proverb that no one knows what he can stand till he is tried  the blows which she is at present delivering to it with her mallet are fast driving all preconceived notions in regard to linen out of my head  scrubbing it as she does now with a hard brush against the asperities of the rough plank and then twisting it up like a rolypoly prior to swishing it through the water a second time would once have induced me to doubt the strength of delicate motherofpearl buttons and fine white thread  i shall doubt no longer  as he said so madame grennon chanced to look up and caught sight of the strangers  she rose at once and forsaking her tub advanced to meet them the curlyhaired daughter following close at her heels for wherever her mother went she followed and whatever her mother did she imitated  the object of the visit was soon explained and the good woman led the visitors into her hut where baptist le croix chanced to be at the time  there was something very striking in the appearance of this man  he was a tall finelooking fellow a little past the prime of life but with a frame whose great muscular power was in no degree abated  his face was grave goodnatured and deeply sunburnt but there was a peculiarly anxious look about the eyes and a restless motion in them as if he were constantly searching for something which he could not find  he willingly undertook to conduct his friends wife and child to the residence of their relative  on leaving the hut to return to chamouni madame grennon accompanied her visitors a short way and nita took occasion while expressing admiration of baptists appearance to comment on his curiously anxious look  ah  mademoiselle said madame with a half sad look the poor man is taken up with a strange notionsome people call it a delusionthat gold is to be found somewhere here in the mountains  gold cried nita with such energy that her companions looked at her in surprise  why nita exclaimed emma your looks are almost as troubled and anxious as those of le croix himself  how strange said nita musing and paying no attention to emmas remark  why does he think so  indeed mademoiselle i cannot tell but he seems quite sure of it and spends nearly all his time in the mountains searching for gold and hunting the chamois  they parted here and for a time lewis tried to rally nita about what he styled her sympathy with the chamoishunter but nita did not retort with her wonted sprightliness the flow of her spirits was obviously checked and did not return during their walk back to the hotel  while this little incident was enacting in the valley events of a far different nature were taking place among the mountains into the solitudes of which the professor accompanied by captain wopper lawrence slingsby and gillie and led by antoine had penetrated for the purpose of ascertaining the motion of a huge precipice of ice  you are not a nervous man i think said the professor to antoine as they plodded over the ice together  no monsieur not very answered the guide with a smile and a sly glance out of the corners of his eyes  captain wopper laughed aloud at the question and gillie grinned  gillies countenance was frequently the residence of a broad grin  nature had furnished him with a keen sense of the ludicrous and a remarkably open countenance  human beings are said to be blind to their own peculiarities  if gillie had been an exception to this rule and if he could have by some magical power been enabled to stand aside and look at his own spiderlike little frame as others saw it clad in blue tights and buttons it is highly probable that he would have expired in laughing at himself  i ask the question continued the professor because i mean to request your assistance in taking measurements in a somewhat dangerous place namely the iceprecipice of the tacul  it is well monsieur returned the guide with another smile i am a little used to dangerous places  gillie pulled his small hands out of the trouserpockets in which he usually carried them and rubbed them by way of expressing his gleeful feelings  had the sentiment which predominated in his little mind been audibly expressed it would probably have found vent in some such phrase as wont there be fun neitheroh dear no not by no means  to him the height of happiness was the practice of mischief  danger in his estimation meant an extremely delicious form of mischief  is the place picturesque as well as dangerous asked slingsby with a wild look in his large eyes as he walked nearer to the professor  it is you will find many aspects of iceformation well worthy of your pencil  it is due to the artist to say that his wildness that morning was not the result only of despair at the obvious indifference with which nita regarded him  it was the combination of that wretched condition with a heroic resolve to forsake the coy maiden and return to his first love his beloved artthat excited him and the idea of renewing his devotion to her in dangerous circumstances was rather congenial to his savage state of mind  it may be here remarked that mr slingsby besides being an enthusiastic painter was an original genius in a variety of ways among other qualities he possessed an inventive mind and besides having had an iceaxe made after a pattern of his ownwhich was entirely new and nearly uselesshe had designed a new style of belt with a powerful rope having a hook attached to it with which he proposed and actually managed to clamber up and down difficult places and thus attain points of vantage for sketching  several times had he been rescued by guides from positions of extreme peril but his daring and altogether unteachable spirit had thrown him again and again into new conditions of danger  he was armed with his formidable belt and rope on the present excursion and his aspect was such that his friends felt rather uneasy about him and would not have been surprised if he had put the belt round his neck instead of his waist and attempted to hang himself  do you expect to complete your measurements today asked lawrence who accompanied the professor as his assistant  oh no  that were impossible  i can merely fix my stakes today and leave them  tomorrow or next day i will return to observe the result  the eastern side of the glacier du geant near the tacul at which they soon arrived showed an almost perpendicular precipice about 140 feet high  as they collected in a group in front of that mighty paleblue wall the danger to which the professor had alluded became apparent even to the most inexperienced eye among them  high on the summit of the precipice where its edge cut sharply against the blue sky could be seen the black boulders and debris of the lateral moraine of the glacier  the day was unusually warm and the ice melted so rapidly that parts of this moraine were being sent down in frequent avalanches  the rustle of debris was almost incessant and ever and anon the rustle rose into a roar as great boulders bounded over the edge and after dashing portions of the icecliffs into atoms went smoking down into the chaos below  it was just beyond this chaos that the party stood  now antoine said the professor i want you to go to the foot of that precipice and fix a stake in the ice there  well monsieur it shall be done returned the guide divesting himself of his knapsack and shouldering his axe and a stake  meanwhile continued the professor i will watch the falling debris to warn you of danger in time and the direction in which you must run to avoid it  my friend lawrence with the aid of captain wopper will fix the theodolite on yonder rocky knoll to our left  nothin for you an me to do said gillie to the artist praps wed better go and draweh  slingsby looked at the blue spider before him with an amused smile and agreed that his suggestion was not a bad one so they went off together  while antoine was proceeding to the foot of the icecliffs on his dangerous mission the professor observed that the first direction of a falling stones bound was no sure index of its subsequent motion as it was sent hither and thither by the obstructions with which it met  he therefore recalled the guide  it wont do antoine the danger is too great  but monsieur if it is necessary  but it is not necessary that you should risk your life in the pursuit of knowledge  besides i must have a stake fixed halfway up the face of that precipice  ah monsieur said antoine with an incredulous smile that is not possible  to this the professor made no reply but ordered his guide to make a detour and ascend to the upper edge of the iceprecipice for the purpose of dislodging the larger and more dangerous blocks of stone there and after that to plant a stake on the summit  this operation was not quickly performed  antoine had to make a long detour to get on the glacier and when he did reach the moraine on the top he found that many of the most dangerous blocks lay beyond the reach of his axe  however he sent the smaller debris in copious showers down the precipice and by cleverly rolling some comparatively small boulders down upon those larger ones which lay out of reach he succeeded in dislodging many of them  this accomplished he proceeded to fix the stake on the upper surface of the glacier  while he was thus occupied the professor assisted lawrence in fixing the theodolite and then leaving him went to a neighbouring heap of debris followed by the captain whom he stationed there  i want you he said to keep a good lookout and warn me as to which way i must run to avoid falling rocks  antoine has dislodged many of them but some he cannot reach  these enemies must be watched  so saying the professor placed a stake and an auger against his breast buttoned his coat over them and shouldered his axe  you dont mean to say that youre agoing to go under that cliff exclaimed the captain in great surprise laying his hand on the professors arm and detaining him  my friend returned the man of science do not detain me  time is precious just now  you have placed yourself under my orders for the day and being a seaman must understand the value of prompt obedience do as i bid you  he turned and went off at a swinging pace towards the foot of the icecliff while the captain in a state of anxiety amounting almost to consternation sat down on a boulder took off his hat wiped his heated brow pronounced the professor as mad as a march hare and prepared to discharge his duties as the lookout  although cool as a cucumber in all circumstances at sea where he knew every danger and how to meet or avoid it the worthy captain now almost lost selfcontrol and became intensely agitated and anxious insomuch that he gave frequent and hurried false alarms which he no less hurriedly attempted to correct sometimes in nautical terms much to the confusion of the professor  hallo hi look outstarboardstaaarboard he shouted wildly on beholding a rock about the size of a chest of drawers spring from the heights above and rush downward with a smoke of icedust and debris following quick there no port  port  i say its  before he could finish the sentence the mass had fallen a long way to the right of the professor and lay quiet on the ice not far from where the captain stood  in spite of the interruptions thus caused the lower stake was fixed in a few minutes  the professor then swung his axe vigorously and began to cut an oblique staircase in the ice up the sheer face of the precipice  in some respects the danger to the bold adventurer was now not so great because being as it were flat against the icecliffs falling rocks were more likely by striking some projection to bound beyond him still there was the danger of deflected shots and when by cutting a succession of notches in which to place one foot at a time he had ascended to the height of an average threestorey house the danger of losing his balance or slipping a foot became very great indeed  but the man of science persevered in doing what he conceived to be his duty with as much coolness as if he were the leader of a forlorn hope  following the example of experienced icemen on steep places he took good care to make the notches or steps slope a little inwards never lifted his foot from one step until the next was ready and never swung his axe until his balance was perfectly secured  having gained a height of about thirty feet he pierced a hole with his auger fastened a stake in it and descended amid a heavy cannonade of boulders and a smart fire of smaller debris  during the whole proceeding lawrence directed his friend as to the placing of the stake and watched with surprise as well as anxiety while captain wopper kept on shouting unintelligible words of warning in a state of extreme agitation  the guide returned just in time to see this part of the work completed and to remonstrate gravely with the professor on his reckless conduct  alls well that ends well antoine as a great poet says replied the professor with one of his most genial smiles  we must run some risk in the pursuit of scientific investigation  now then lawrence i hope you have got the three stakes in the same linelet me see  applying his eye to the theodolite he found that the stakes were in an exactly perpendicular line one above another  he then carefully marked the spot occupied by the instrument and thus completed his labours for that time  we may add here in passing that next day he returned to the same place and found that in twentyfour hours the bottom stake had moved downwards a little more than two inches the middle stake had descended a little more than three and the upper stake exactly six inches  thus he was enabled to corroborate the fact which had been ascertained by other men of science before him that glaciermotion is more rapid at the top than at the bottom where the friction against its bed tends to hinder its advance and that the rate of flow increases gradually from the bottom upwards  while these points of interest were being established our artist was not less earnestly engaged in prosecuting his own peculiar work to the intense interest of gillie who although he had seen and admired many a picture in the london shopwindows had never before witnessed the actual process by which such things are created  wandering away on the glacier among some fantastically formed and towering blocks or obelisks of ice mr slingsby expressed to gillie his admiration of their picturesque shapes and delicate blue colour in language which his small companion did not clearly understand but which he highly approved of notwithstanding  i think this one is worth painting cried slingsby pausing and throwing himself into an observant attitude before a natural arch from the roof of which depended some large icicles it is extremely picturesque  i think said gillie with earnest gravity that yonders one as is more picturesker  he had carefully watched the artists various observant attitudes and now threw himself into one of these as he pointed to a sloping obelisk the size of an average churchsteeple which bore some resemblance to the leaningtower of pisa  you are right boy that is a better mass  come let us go paint it  while walking towards it gillie asked how such wild masses came to be made  i am told by the professor said slingsby that when the ice cracks across and afterwards lengthwise the square blocks thus formed get detached as they descend the valley and assume these fantastic forms  ah jis so  they descends the walley does they  so it is said  gillie made no reply though he said in his heart you wont git me to swaller that by no manner of means  his unbelief was however rebuked by the leaningtower of pisa giving a terrible rend at that moment and slowly bending forward  it was an alarming as well as grand sight for they were pretty near to it  some smaller blocks of ice that lay below prevented the tower from being broken in its fall  these were crushed to powder by it and then as if they formed a convenient carriage for it the mighty mass slid slowly down the slope for a few feet  it was checked for a moment by another block which however gave way before the great pressure fell aside and let it pass  the slope was slight at the spot so that the obelisk moved slowly and once or twice seemed on the point of stopping but as if it had become endowed with life it made a sudden thrust squeezed two or three obstacles flat turned others aside and thus wound its way among its fellows with a low groaning sound like some sluggish monster of the antediluvian world  reaching a steeper part of the glacier on the ridge of which it hung for a moment as if unwilling to exert itself it seemed to awake to the reality of its position  making a lively rush that seemed tremendously inconsistent with its weight it shot over the edge of a yawning crevasse burst with a thunderclap on the opposite icecliff and went roaring into the dark bowels of the glacier whence the echoes of its tumbling masses subdued by distance came up like the mutterings of evil spirits  gillie viewed this wondrous spectacle with an awestricken heart and then vented his feelings in a prolonged yell of ecstasy  aint it splendid sir he cried turning his glowing eyes on slingsby  majestic exclaimed the artist whose enthusiasm was equal to that of his companion though not quite so demonstrative  raither spoiled your drawin though aint it sir  yonder is something quite as good if not better said slingsby  he pointed as he spoke to a part of the crevasse higher up on the glacier where a projecting cave of snow overhung the abyss  from the undersurface of this a number of gigantic icicles hung the lower points of the longer ones almost lost in the blue depths  a good position from which to sketch it however was not easily reached and it was only by getting close to the edge of the crevasse that the persevering artist at length attained his object  here he sat down on his topcoat folded several times to guard him from the cold ice spread out his colourbox and sketchingblock and otherwise made himself comfortable while gillie sat down beside him on his own cap for want of a better protector  had these two enthusiasts known the nature of their position they would have retired from it precipitately with horror for ignorant of almost everything connected with glaciers they had walked right off the solid ice and seated themselves on a comparatively thin projecting ledge of snow which overhung the crevasse  thus they remained for some time enjoying themselves with death as it were waiting for them underneath  what rendered their position more critical was the great heat of the day which whatever might be the strength of the sustaining ledge was reducing its bulk continually  after having sketched for some time the artist thought it advisable to see as far down into the crevasse as possible in order to put in the point of the longest icicle  the better to do this he unwound his rope from his waist and flung it on the ice by his side while he lay down on his breast and looked over the edge  still he did not perceive the danger of his position and went on sketching diligently in this awkward attitude  now it was a melancholy fact that master gillies interest in art or science was shortlived though keen  he soon tired of watching his companion and began to look about him with a view to mischief  not seeing anything specially suggestive he thought of aiding the operations of nature by expediting the descent of some neighbouring boulders from their positions on iceblocks  he intimated his intention to slingsby but the artist was too much engrossed to give heed to him just as he was rising gillies eye fell on the rope and a happy thought struck him  to carry striking thoughts into immediate execution was a marked feature of the boys character  he observed that one end of the rope was attached to mr slingsbys belt  taking up the hook at the other end he went with it towards a large boulder drawing the rope after him with extreme care for fear of arousing his companion by a tug  he found that when fully stretched it was just long enough to pass round the rock  quickly fastening it therefore by means of the hook he walked quietly away  he did not exhibit much excitement while doing this  it was after all but a trifling jest in his esteem as the only result to be hoped for would be the giving of a surprise by the little tug which might perhaps be experienced by the artist on rising  thereafter gillie sent innumerable iceblocks to premature destruction and enjoyed the work immensely for a time but having exploratory tendencies he soon wandered about among obelisks and caverns until he found himself underneath the icecliff on which his friend was seated then as he looked up at the overhanging ledge from which gigantic icicles were hanging a shock of alarm thrilled his little breast  this was increased by the falling of one of the icicles which went like a blue javelin into the crevasse beside him  gillie thought of shouting to warn mr slingsby of his danger but before he could do so he was startled by an appalling yell  at the same moment part of the ice overhead gave way and he beheld the artist descending  he was stopped with a sudden jerk as the rope tightened and remained suspended in the air while his coat and colourbox accompanied icicles and snowblocks into the abyss below  a second later and the struggling artists head appeared to fall off but it was only his hat  gillie had by this time recovered himself so far as to be able to add his piercing shrieks for help to the cries of the artist and well was it that day for mr slingsby that gillie had since the years of infancy practised his lungs to some purpose in terrifying cats and defying bobbies in the streets of london  oh sir siri sayhi he cried panting and glaring up  eh what  hah gasped slingsby panting and glaring down  dont kick like that sir pray dont cried gillie in agonised tones youll start the boulder wot yer fast to if you dont keep still  oh groaned the artist and instantly hung limp and motionless in which condition he remained while gillie ran towards the place where he had left the rest of the party jumping and slipping and falling and yelling over the ice like a maniac in blue and buttons  dee hear that exclaimed captain wopper with a startled look as he and his companions busied themselves packing up their instruments  antoine grennon heard it but made no reply  he was familiar with cries of alarm  turning abruptly he dashed off at full speed in the direction whence the cries came  the captain and professor instantly followed lawrence overtook and passed them  in a few minutes they met the terrified boy who instead of waiting for them and wasting time by telling what was wrong turned sharp round gave one wild wave of his hand and ran straight back to the ledge from which poor slingsby hung stout willing arms were soon pulling cautiously on the rope and in a few minutes more the artist lay upon the safe ice almost speechless from terror and with a deadly pallor on his brow  strange to say the indomitable artist had held on tight to his sketchbook possibly because it was almost as dear to him as life but more probably because of that feeling which induces a drowning man to clutch at a straw    note 1  we ourselves had the satisfaction of witnessing this wonderful and beautiful phenomenon before having read or heard of it while on a trip from chamouni to martigny over the tete noire    chapter fourteen  the grand ascent begun  mrs stoutley reposing at full length on a sofa in the salon one evening observed to the count horetzki that she really could not understand it at all that it seemed to her a tempting of providence to risk ones life for nothing and that upon the whole she thought these excursions on glaciers were very useless and foolish  the salon was full of people grouped in little knots fighting the battles of the day oer again playing backgammon and chess or poring over maps and guidebooks  it does indeed seem foolish answered the count whose native politeness induced him always to agree with ladies when possible and as far as any practical purpose is served i should think it useless nevertheless it seems to afford amusement to many people and amusement in some form or other would appear to be almost necessary to our happy existence  true replied mrs stoutley languidly but people ought to content themselves with quiet and safe amusements  how ridiculous it is to find pleasure in climbing iceprecipices and leaping over crevasses and sitting under showerbaths of boulderstones  im sure that i could not find pleasure in such pranks even if i were to make the effort  how much better to seek and find enjoyment in wandering with a book through shady forests and gathering wildflowers  dont you agree with me count  the counts usually grave and anxious visage relaxed into a smile as he protested that he agreed with her entirely  at the same time he added there does appear to be some sort of aspiring tendency in the young and strong to attempt the repression of which would seem to be useless even if desirable  do you know madame while on a voyage some years ago i saw a boy who used to dive off the foreyardarm into the sea and who went regularly every morning before breakfast to the mainmasthead and sat on that buttonlike piece of wood called the truck  how very reckless said mrs stoutley and how shamefully regardless of the feelings of his mother for of course if he had a mother and if she were a woman of right feeling she must have been horrified  i am afraid madame that you would have esteemed her a lady of wrong feeling for she applauded her boy and used to say that if he only took care to acquire as much moral as he had physical courage so as to become as brave and bold a soldier of the cross as he was sure to be of the crown he would resemble his own father who was the best and bravest man that ever lived  how strange murmured mrs stoutley such inconsistencies  but there does seem to be a considerable number of masculine women in the world who encourage what we call muscular christianity  yes there are indeed strange inconsistencies around us returned the count  you have however mistaken the character of this particular mother for she was the reverse of masculine being delicate and tenderhearted and refined and ladylike while her boy was bold as a lionyet obedient and gentle to her as a lamb  he afterwards became a soldier and on the occasion of a wild storm on the east coast of england he swam off to a wreck with a rope when no man in the place could be got to do it for love or money and was the means of rescuing four women and six men in accomplishing which however he lost his life  oh how shocking how very sad said mrs stoutley startled into animation by the suddenness of the revelation and how different it might have been if the youth had been trained to gentler amusements  he might have been alive now  yes returned the count and the four women and six men might have been dead  but here come two friends who are better able to give an opinion on the point than i am  what may the pint be asked captain wopper with a genial smile as if he were ready to tackle anything from a pint of beer to a pint of the compass  only state your case mrs stoutley an the professor here hell act the judge an ill be the jury  the jury is too small said lewis coming up at that moment  small young man repeated the captain with feigned surprise as he drew himself up to his full height and squared his broad shoulders  not physically but numerically retorted lewis with a laughho emma miss horetzki lawrence slingsby he called to the quartette who sat chatting in a bay window you are hereby summoned to act on a jury  come along and have yourselves impaledi mean to say impannelled  a most important case just going on for trial  what is the nature of the case asked lawrence as they all came forward and sat down in a semicircle before mrs stoutley  it hant got no naturits unnateral altogether said the captain who had just heard it briefly stated by the count  hallo are you appointed public prosecutor demanded lewis  yes i am retorted the captain ive appinted myself public persecuter lord advocate lord high commissioner to the woolsack an any other legal an illegal character ye choose to name  so you clap a stopper on yer muzzle youngster while i state the case  here is mrs stoutley my lords ladies and gentlemen who says that climbin an gaugin and glaciers is foolish and useless  thats two counts which the count here nothin personal meant says the prisoner was guilty of well go in an win on the last count for if these things aint useless dee see they cant be foolish  well the question is guilty or not guilty  guilty replied mrs stoutley with an amused smile  hear hear from slingsby  silence in the court from lewis  im afraid said the professor that our forms of legal procedure are somewhat irregular  never mind that professor said the captain you go ahead an prove the prisoner wrong  take the wind out of her sails if ee can  the professor smiled blandly and began in jest but his enthusiastic spirit and love of abstract truth soon made him argue in earnest  oh thats all very well said mrs stoutley interrupting him but what possible use can there be in knowing the rate of speed at which a glacier flows  what does it matter whether it flows six or sixty or six hundred feet in a day  matter cried lewis before the professor could reply why it matters very much indeed  i can prove it  our excellent guide antoine told me of a man who fell into a crevasse high up on the glacier des bossons and was of course lost but about forty years afterwards the part of the glacier into which he fell had descended into the valley and the body of the man was foundat least portions of it were found here and there  this as you are all aware is a wellknown fact  bear in mind in connection with this that all glaciers do not travel at the same rate nor all parts of a glacier at an equal rate  now suppose that you were to lose a gold watch or a diamond ring in a crevasse the value of which might be incalculable in consequence of being a gift from some beloved one would it not be a matter of the last importance to know exactly the rate at which the said crevasse travelled so that you or your grandchildren might return at the precise time and claim the property  dont talk nonsense lewie said his mother  no doubt said the professor laughing my young friends illustration is to the point and i fear that i cannot give you anything more definite to prove the value of glacial measurements and observations  i must rest my proof on the abstract truth that all knowledge is desirable and ought to be sought after for its own sake as being the means whereby we shall come better to know the good and wise creator whom to know as his own word says is life eternal but i can give you distinct proof in a somewhat analogous case of good resulting from knowledge which was eagerly pursued and acquired without the searcher having the slightest idea as to the use to which his knowledge would be ultimately put  you have doubtless heard of captain maury of the united states navy  oh yes replied mrs stoutley he who writes that charming book the physical geography of the sea or some such title  my son is a great admirer of that work  i tried to read it to please him but i must confess that i could not go far into it  it seemed to me an endless and useless search after currents of wind and water  i see you must have missed the very illustrations which i am about to cite for they are given in his bookone of the most interesting i ever read and not the less interesting that its author distinguishes a connection between the creators word and his works  you know that captain maurys investigations of currents of wind and water were conducted wisely and on a vast scale  nautical men of many nations sent in their logs to him and he patiently collected and collated all the facts observed in all parts of the ocean  yes and quite useless knowledge it appears to me said mrs stoutley  well we shall see returned the professor  there was once a terrible storm on the atlantic and a vessel with troops on board was so disabled as to be left at last a helpless log upon the sea  she was passed by other vessels but these could render no assistance owing to the raging storm  they however took note of the latitude and longitude of the wreck and reported her on arriving at new york  a rescueship was at once ordered to search for her but before sailing captain maury was applied to for instructions how they should proceed the man of science was seated in his study had probably scarce observed the storm and knew nothing about the wreck save her position as observed at a certain date  why therefore we might ask apply to him just because he sat at the fountainhead of such knowledge as was needed  he had long studied and well knew the currents of the ocean their direction and their rate of progress at specified times and particular places  he prepared a chart and marked a spot at or near which the wreck he said would probably be found  the wreck was foundnot indeed by the rescueship but by another vessel at the very spot indicatedand the surviving crew and troops were saved  so in like manner the study of truth regarding currents of air has led us to knowledge which enables mariners to escape the atlantic sargassosea  ha the doldrums growled captain wopper as if he had a special and bitter hatred of that sea  yes the doldrums or sargassosea where ships used to be detained by long vexatious calms and islands of floating seaweed but which now we escape because studious men have pointed out that by sailing to one side of that sea you can get into favourable breezes avoid the calm regions and thus save much time  now madame said captain wopper are you convinced  not quite replied mrs stoutley with a baffled look but i suppose on the strength of this and similar reasons you intend to ascend mont blanc tomorrow  we do said the professor  i intend to go for the purpose of attempting to fix a thermometer on the summit in order to ascertain if possible the winter temperature  and pray for what purpose said mrs stoutley with a touch of sarcasm does dr lawrence intend to go  for the purpose of seeing the magnificent view and of testing the lungs and muscles which are now i think sufficiently trained to enable me to make the ascent with ease replied the doctor promptly  i go to assist the professor said captain wopper  and i said lewis intend to go for fun so you see mother as our reasons are all good you had better go to bed for its getting late  mrs stoutley accepted the suggestion delivered a yawn into her pockethandkerchief and retired as she remarked to ascend mont blanc in dreams and thus have all the pleasure without the bodily fatigue  we are on the sides of the mountain monarch now slowly wending our way through the sable fringe of pines that ornaments the skirt of his white mantle  we tramp along very slowly for antoine grennon is in front and wont allow us to go faster  to the impatient and youthful spirits of lawrence and lewis the pace appears ridiculously slow and the latter does not hesitate to make audible reference in his best french to the progress of snails but antoine is deaf to such references  one might fancy that he did not understand bad french but for the momentary twinkle in his earnest eyes  but nothing will induce him to mend his pace for well does he know that the ascent of mont blanc is no trifle that even trained lungs and muscles are pretty severely taxed before the fifteen thousand seven hundred and eighty feet of perpendicular height above the sealevel is placed below the soles of the feet  he knows also from long experience that he who would climb a mountain well and use his strength to advantage must begin with a slow leisurely pace as if he were merely out for a saunter yet must progress with steady persevering regularity  he knows too that young blood is prone to breast a mountain with head erect and spanking action and to descend with woeful countenance and limp limbs  it must be restrained and antoine does his duty  the ascent of mont blanc cannot be accomplished in one day  it is therefore necessary to sleep at a place named the grands mulets from which a fresh start is made for the summit at the earliest hours of morning on the second day  towards this restingplace our travellers now directed their steps  the party consisted of the professor captain wopper lewis lawrence and slingsby headed by their trusty guide besides three porters with knapsacks containing food wine etcetera  one of these latter was the chamoishunter baptist le croix  he brought up the rear of the party and all proceeded in single file each like the north american indian treading in his predecessors footsteps  passing from the dark fringe of pines they emerged upon a more open country where the royal robe was wrought with larch and hazel bilberry and varied underwood and speckled with rhododendrons and other flowers on a ground of rich brown green and grey  steadily upwards over the glacier des bossons they went with airy cloudlets floating around them with the summit at which they aimed the dome du gouter and the aiguille du gouter in front luring them on and other giant aiguilles around watching them  several hours of steady climbing brought them to the pierre lechelle where they were furnished with woollen leggings to protect their legs from the snow  here also they procured a ladder and began the tedious work of traversing the glaciers  hitherto their route had lain chiefly on solid groundover grassy slopes and along rocky paths  it was now to be confined almost entirely to the ice which they found to be cut up in all directions with fissures so that great caution was needed in crossing crevasses and creeping round slippery ridges and progress was for some time very slow  coming to one of the crevasses which was too wide to leap the ladder was put in requisition  the iron spikes with which one end of it was shod were driven firmly into the ice at one side of the chasm and the other end rested on the opposite side  antoine crossed first and then held out his hand to the professor who followed but the man of science was an expert iceman and in another moment stood at the guides side without having required assistance not so captain wopper  im not exactly a feather he said looking with a doubtful expression at the frail bridge  it bore me well enough captain said the professor with a smile  thats just what it didnt replied the captain it seemed to me to bend too much under you besides although im bound to admit that youre a good lump of a man professor i suspect theres a couple of stones more on me than on you  if it was only a rope now such as ive bin used to id go at it at once but  it is quite strong enough said the guide confidently  well here goes returned the mariner but if it gives way antoine ill have you hanged for murder  uttering this threat he crossed in safety the others followed and the party advanced over a part of the glacier which was rugged with mounds towers obelisks and pyramids of ice  for some time nothing serious interrupted their progress until they came to another wide crevasse when it was found to the guides indignation that the ladder had been purposely left behind by the porter to whom it had been intrusted he being under the impression that it would not be further required  blockhead cried the professor whose enthusiastic spirit was easily roused to indignation it was your duty to carry it till ordered to lay it down  you were hired to act sir not to think  obedience is the highest virtue of a servant  shall we send him back for it he said turning to antoine with a flushed countenance  not now monsieur answered the guide it would create needless delay  we shall try to work round the crevasse  this they did by following its edge until they found a part where crossing was possible though attended with considerable danger in consequence of the wedgelike and crumbling nature of the ice  hoping that such a difficulty would not occur again they pushed on but had not gone far when another and still more impassable fissure presented itself  how provoking couldnt we jump it said lewis looking inquiringly into the darkblue depths  praps you might youngster with your half fledged spiderlegs said the captain but youll not catch fourteenstunsix goin over that with its own free will  whats to be done now antoine  the guide after looking at the crevasse for a few minutes said that the next thing to be done was to look for a snowbridge which he had no doubt would be found somewhere  in search of this he scattered the whole party and in a few minutes a loud shout from the chamoishunter told that he had been successful  the members of the party at once converged towards him but found that the success was only partial  he had indeed found a part of the crevasse which during some of the wild storms so frequent on the mountain had been bridged over by a snowwreath but the central part of the bridge had given way and it was thus divided by a gap of about a foot wide  this would have been but a small and insignificant step to take had the substance been solid but although the ice on one side was strong the opposite edge was comparatively soft snow and not much more than a foot thick  the chamoishunter being the lightest of the party was called to the front and ordered to test the strength of the frail bridge if bridge it could be called  why he might as well try to step on a bit of seafoam said the captain in surprise  lawrence lewis and slingsby having as yet had no experience of such places expressed or held a similar opinion but the professor bade them wait and see  baptist throwing off his pack and fastening a rope round his waist which his comrades held advanced to the extreme edge of the ice and with his longhandled axe gently patted the snow on the opposite side the surface yielded and it seemed as if even that small weight would break the lump off but the operation consolidated the mass in a few minutes by reason of what the professor termed regelation  he then stepped tenderly on it crossed over and drew the rope after him antoine followed next and in a few minutes the whole party was safe on the other side  dr lawrence said slingsby in a low grave tone as they walked along after this if we ever see chamouni again i shall be surprised  indeed returned lawrence with a short laugh i dont take quite so gloomy a view of our case  dont you think that the free and easy quiet look of our guide and porters indicates that such work looks more dangerous than it really is  i dont know that said the artist shaking his head when men get thoroughly accustomed to danger they become foolhardy and dont realise it  i think it sheer madness to cross such places  lewis who overheard the conversation could scarce refrain from a burst of laughter  upon my word slingsby said he such observations come strangely from the lips of a man who only a day or two ago was caught sketching on a snowwreath over the edge of a crevasse  ah but i didnt know it retorted the other and even if i had known it the ledge of snow was immensely stronger than that on which we have just stood  at this point the conversation was interrupted by the guide stopping and saying that it was now necessary to tie the party together  they had reached those higher parts of the glacier where snow frequently falls and covers to some extent the narrower crevasses thus by concealing them rendering them extremely dangerous traps  it therefore became necessary to attach the various members of the party together by means of a rope which passing round their waists with a few feet between each enabled them to rescue any one who should chance to break through  thus in a string they advanced and had scarcely proceeded a hundred yards when a surprised hallo from captain wopper arrested them  he had sunk up to the knees in snow  a hallo of alarm instantly succeeded  he was waist deep  a stentorian yell followed  ho hallo hiavast  hold on there abaft  my legs are waublin in nothin  his great weight had indeed nearly plunged him into a hidden crevasse over which those who preceded him had passed in safety  if the captain had stood alone that crevasse would certainly have been his grave but his friends held him tight and in a few seconds he was dragged out of danger  well well he said wiping some large drops of perspiration from his brow as he stood on the other side of the chasm landlubbers talk about seafarin men havin nothin but a plank between them an death but to my thinkin the rottenest plank that ever was launched is absolute safety compared to a snowwreath  ah  captain said the professor laughing you think so just now because youre not used to it  in a few weeks youll hold a different opinion  may be so replied the captain quietly but it dont feel soheave ahead my hearties  thus encouraged the party proceeded with caution the guide sounding the snow at each step with his long axehandle as he moved in advance  slowly they mounted higher and higher occasionally meeting with but always overcoming difficulties until towards evening they reached the little log cabin on the grands mulets not sorry to find in it a sufficient though humble restingplace for the night  here they proceeded to make themselves comfortable  some firewood had been carried up by the porters with which a fire was kindled wet garments were hung up to dry and hot coffee was prepared while the sun sank in a gorgeous world of amber and crimson fire  one by one the stars came out and gradually twinkled into brilliancy until at last the glorious host of heaven shone in the deepening sky with an intensity of lustre that cannot be described contrasting strangely with the pallid ghostly aspect of the surrounding snowfields these were the only trace of earth that now remained to greet the eyes of our travellers when they looked forth from the door of the little hut  besides being calm and beautiful the night was intensely cold there is this peculiarity on alpine mountain tops that when the suns last rays desert them the temperature falls abruptly there being little or nothing of earth or rock to conserve the heat poured out during the day  the mountaineers therefore soon after night closed in found it necessary to shut the door of their cabin where they roused up the fire quaffed their steaming coffee and smoked their pipes in joyful anticipation of the coming day    chapter fifteen  the grand ascent continued and completed  need we say that the younger of our adventurersfor such they may truly be styledfelt a tendency to spin yarns as captain wopper expressed it till a late hour that night as they sat round the fire at the grands mulets  during this enjoyable period lawrence and lewis made themselves better acquainted with baptist le croix the chamoishunter whose quiet gentle and unobtrusive manner was very attractive to them  many an anecdote did he relate of adventures among the alpine peaks and passes while pursuing the chamois or guiding travellers on their way and it is probable that he might have roamed in spirit among his beloved hauntseagerly followed in spirit by the young menif he had not been called to order by the guide who remembering the hard work that lay before them on the morrow suggested repose  the profound silence that soon reigned in the hut was broken only by an occasional longdrawn sigh  even captain wopper was quiet having been so powerfully influenced by fresh mountain air and exercise as to have forgotten or foregone his ordinary and inveterate snore  there is something peculiarly disagreeable in being awakened when one is very tired and sleepy about two minutes after one has dropped into a profound refreshing slumber and the annoyance is severely aggravated when it is caused by the wanton act of one of whom we had expected better things  so in a hazy way thought lewis stoutley when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder and heard the voice of antoine grennon  monsieur  monsieur said the guide  gtlong  dn borer me murmured lewis in tones so sleepy that the dash of crossness was barely perceptible  it is time to rise sir persisted antoine  mpossblev jus bn two mints sle  a profound sigh formed an eloquent peroration to the sentence  a loud laugh from his companions who were already up and getting ready did more than the guides powers of suasion to arouse the heavy sleeper he started to a sitting posture stared with imbecile surprise at the candle which dimly lighted the cabin and yawned vociferously  what a sleeper you are lewie said lawrence with a laugh as on his knees before the fire he busied himself in preparing coffee for the party  and such a growler too when any one touches you observed slingsby buttoning on his leggings  sleeper growler groaned lewis youve only given me five minutes in which to sleep or growl  ah the happy obliviousness of youth said the professor assisting one of the porters to strap up the scientific instruments you have been asleep four hours at least  it is now past one  we must start in less than an hour so bestir yourselfand pray dr lawrence make haste with that coffee  the doctor was by no means slow in his operations but the difficulties in his way delayed him  at such a height and in such a frozen region the only mode of procuring water was to place a panful of snow on the fire and no matter how full the pan might be stuffed with it this snow when melted was reduced to only a very small quantity of water more snow had therefore to be added and melted so that much time was spent before the boiling point was reached  patience however was at last rewarded with a steaming draught which with bread and ham did more than fire towards warming their chill bodies  outside the scene was still exquisitely calm and beautiful  the stars appeared to have gathered fresh brilliancy and to have increased in number during the night  those of them near the horizon as the professor pointed out twinkled energetically as if they had just risen and like lewis were sleepy while those in the zenith shone with steady lustre as if particularly wide awake to the doings of the presumptuous men who were climbing so much nearer than usual to their habitation in the sky  one star in particular gleamed with a sheen that was preeminently gloriousnow it was ruby red now metallic blue anon emerald green  of course no sunlight would tinge the horizon for several hours but the bright moon which had just risen rolled floods of silver over the snowy wastes rendering unnecessary the lantern which had been provided to illumine their upward path  the party having been tied together with a rope as on the previous day set forth in line over the snow each following the other and soon they were doing battle with the deep crevasses  the nature of the ice varied of course with the form of the mountain sometimes presenting rugged and difficult places in which as the captain put it they got among breakers and had to steer with caution at other times presenting comparatively level plains of snow over which all was plain sailing but the movement was upwardsever upwardsand as the day advanced felt so prolonged that at last as slingsby said the climbing motion grew into a confirmed habit  meanwhile the old world sank steadily below them and seen from such an elevation in the pale moonlight lost much of its familiar look  even sounds appeared gradually to die out of that mysterious region for when they chanced to pause for a moment to recover breath or to gaze downward each appeared unwilling to break the excessive stillness and all seemed to listen intently as it were to the soundlessness around hearing nought however save the beating of their own pulsations  in such a spot if unaccompanied by guide or friend one might perhaps realise more than in other parts of earth the significance of the phrase alone with god  as dawn approached lewis who had taken care to have himself placed next to baptist le croix renewed his converse in reference to chamoishunting and made arrangements to accompany the hunter on one of his expeditions  is that your sole occupation he asked as the party entered upon a somewhat level snowfield  that and assisting travellers answered baptist  by the way said lewis in a careless tone they tell me that gold is to be found in some parts of these mountains  is that true  if the youths back had not been towards the hunter who walked behind him he might have seen that this question was received with a startled look and that a strange gleam shot from the mans eyes  the question was repeated before he answered it  yes said he in a low voice they say it is to be foundbut i have never found it  have you sought much for it  i have sought for it  the answer was not given promptly and lewis found with some surprise that the subject appeared to be distasteful to the hunter  he therefore dropped it and walked on in silence  walking at the time was comparatively easy for a sharp frost had hardened the surface of the snow and the gemlike lights of heaven enabled them to traverse valleys of ice clamber up snowslopes and cross crevasses without danger except in one or two places where the natural snowbridges were frail and the chasms unusually wide  at one of these crevasses they were brought to a complete standstill it was too wide to be leaped and no bridge was to be found  the movements of a glacier cause the continual shifting of its parts so that although rugged or smooth spots are always sure to be found at the same parts of the glacier each year there is nevertheless annual variety in minute detail  hence the most expert guides are sometimes puzzled as to routes  the crevasse in question was a new one and it was antoines first ascent of mont blanc for that year so that he had to explore for a passage just as if he had never been there before  the party turned to the left and marched along the edge of the chasm some distance but no bridge could be found  the ice became more broken up smaller crevasses intersected the large one and at last a place was reached where the chaos of dislocation rendered further advance impossible  lost your bearins antoine asked captain wopper  no i have only got into difficulties replied the guide with a quiet smile  just sobreakers ahead  well i suppose youll bout ship an run along the coast till we find a channel  this was precisely what antoine meant to do and did but it was not until more than an hour had been lost that a safe bridge was found when they had crossed the configuration of the ice forced them to adopt a route which they would willingly have avoided  a steep incline of snow rose on their right on the heights above which loose icegrags were poised as if on the point of falling  indeed two or three tracks were passed down which probably at no distant period some of these avalanches had shot  it was nervous work passing under them  even antoine looked up at them with a grave inquiring glance and hastened his pace as much as was consistent with comfort and dignity  soon after this the sun began to rise and the upper portions of the snow were irradiated with pink splendour but to our travellers he had not yet risen owing to the intervening peaks of the aiguille du midi in the brightening light they emerged upon a plain named the petit plateau which forms a reservoir for the avalanches of the dome du goute  above them rose the mountaincrest in three grand masses divided from each other by rents which exposed that peculiar stratified form of the glacier caused by the annual bedding of the snow  from the heights innumerable avalanches had descended strewing the spot where they stood with huge blocks of ice and masses of rock  threading their way through these impediments was a matter not only of time but of difficulty for in some parts the spaces between the boulders and blocks were hollow and covered with thin crusts of snow which gave way the instant a foot was set on them plunging up to their waists the unfortunates who trod there with a shock which usually called forth shouts of astonishment not unmingled with consternation  here then we draw near to the grand summit said the professor pointing to the snowcliffs on the right whence originates the icefountain that supplies such mighty icerivers as the glacier des bossons and the mer de glace  oui monsieur replied antoine smiling we draw near but we are not yet near  we are nearer to the summit however than we are to the plain retorted the professor  truly yes assented the guide  i should think no one could doubt that observed slingsby looking upwards  it looks quite near now said lewis  not so near however as you think and as you shall find rejoined the guide as they resumed their upward march  this was indeed true  nothing is more deceptive to an inexperienced eye than the apparent distance of a high mountaintop  when you imagine that the plain below is miles and miles away and the peak above close at hand you find perhaps on consulting your watch that the plain cannot be very far distant and that the greater part of your work still lies before you  it requires no small amount of resolution to bear up against the depression of spirit caused by frequent mistakes in this matter  owing to the increasing height and power of the sun the snow beyond the petit plateau soon became soft and the steepness of the ascent increasing their advance became slower and their work much more laborious  a pleasant break was however at hand for on reaching the grand plateau they were cheered by the suns rays beaming directly on them and by the information that they had at length reached their breakfastpoint  it may not be a very romantic but it is an interesting fact that the joys connected with intellectual and material food are intimately blended  man without intellectual food becomes a lower animal what intellectual man is without material food even for part of a day let those testify who have had the misfortune to go on a picnic and discover that an essential element of diet had been forgotten  it is not merely that food is necessary to maintain our strength were that so a five minutes pause or ten at the outside would suffice in captain woppers phraseology to take in cargo or coal the human engine but we rejoice in food and we believe that none enjoy it so much as those whose intellectual appetite is strong  if any doubters of these truths had witnessed the professor and his friends at breakfast that morning on the grand plateau they must have infallibly been convinced  what a gourmand he is whispered lewis to the captain in reference to the man of science and such a genial outflow of wit to correspond with his amazing indraught of wittles  the captains teeth were at the moment fixed with almost tigerish ferocity in a chicken drumstick but the humour and the amazing noveltyto say nothing of the truthof lewiss remark made him remove the drumstick and give vent to a roar of laughter that shook the very summit of mont blancat all events the professor said it did and he was a man who weighed his words and considered well his sentiments  do not imagine that i exaggerate he said as distinctly as was compatible with a very large mouthful of ham and bread sound is a motion of vibration not of translation  that delightfully sonorous laugh emitted by captain wopper pass the wine slingsbythanks was an impulse or push delivered by his organs of respiration to the particles of air in immediate contact with his magnificent beard  the impulse thus given to the air was redelivered or passed on not as i pass the mutton to dr lawrence whose plate is almost empty but by each particle of air passing the impulse to its neighbour thus creating an aerial wave or multitude of waves which rolled away into space  those of the waves which rolled in the direction of mont blanc communicated their vibrations to the more solid atoms of the mountain these passed the motion on to each other of course with slightinconceivably slightbut actual force and thus the tremor passed entirely through the mountain out on the other side greatly diminished in power no doubt and right on throughout spacehand me the bread lewis and dont sit grinning there like a cheshire cat with ticdouloureux in its tail  at this slingsby laughed and shook the mountain again besides overturning a bottle of water and upsetting the gravity of antoine grennon who chanced to be looking at him for the artists mouth being large and also queerly shaped appeared to the guide somewhat ludicrous  sympathy like waves of sound is easily transmitted  thus on the captain making to antoine the very simple remark that the mootong was mannyfeek there was a general roar that ought to have brought mont blanc down about their ears  but it didntit only shook him  laughter and sympathy combined improve digestion and strengthen appetite  thus the professors brilliant coruscations and the appreciative condition of his audience created an enjoyment of that mornings meal which was remembered with pleasure long after the event and induced an excessive consumption of food which called forth the remonstrances of the guide who had to remind his uproarious flock that a portion must be reserved for the descent  to the propriety of this lewis not only assented but said that he meant to continue the ascent and rose for that purpose whereupon the doctor said that he dissented entirely from the notion that bad puns increased the hilarity of a party and the captain giving an impulse to the atmosphere with his respiratory organs produced the sound avast and advised them to clap a stopper in their potatotraps  even at these sallies they all laughedproving among other things that mountain air and exercise combined with intellectual and physical food are conducive to easygoing good humour  it is not impossible that the tremors to which mont blanc had been subjected that morning had put him a little out of humour for our mountaineers had scarcely recommenced their upward toil when he shrouded his summit in a few fleecy clouds  the guide shook his head at this  i fear the weather wont hold he said  wont hold exclaimed the captain why its holdin now as hard as it can grip  true observed the professor but weather in these regions is apt to change its mood rather suddenly  yet there seems to me no sign of an unfavourable change said lawrence looking up at the blue and almost cloudless sky  fleecy clouds are fleeting at times returned the professor pointing to the summit which again showed its cap of clear dazzling white but at other times they are indicative of conditions that tend to storm however we must push on and hope for the best  they did push on accordingly and all except the guide had no difficulty in hoping  as they passed over the plateau the sun poured floods of light on the snow from the little crystals of which it shone with prismatic colours as though the place had been strewn with diamonds  the spirit of levity was put to flight by this splendid spectacle and the feelings of the travellers were deepened to solemnity when the guide pointed to a yawning crevasse into which he said three guides were hurled by an avalanche in the year 1820  he also related how on one occasion a party of eleven tourists perished not far from where they then stood during a terrible storm and how an english lady and her guide were at another time lost in a neighbouring crevasse  by this time all except the chief among the surrounding heights were beginning to look insignificant by comparison and the country assumed a sort of rugged flatness in consequence of being looked down upon from such an elevation  passing the grand plateau they reached a steep incline which rose towards a tremendous iceprecipice  from the upper edge of this there hung gigantic icicles  up the incline they went slowly for the crust of the snow broke down at every step and the captain being heavy began to show symptoms of excessive heat and labouring breath but he grew comparatively cool on coming to a snowbridge which had to be passed in order to get over a crevasse  itll never bear my weight he said looking doubtfully at the frail bridge and at the blue gulf which appeared to be a bottomless pit  antoine however thought it might prove strong enough  he patted the snow gently as on previous occasions of a similar kind and advanced with caution while his followers fixed their heels in the snow and held tight to the rope to save him if he should break through  he passed in safety and the others followed but new difficulties awaited them on the other side  just beyond this bridge they came to a slope from which the snow had been completely swept leaving the surface of hard ice exposed  it was so steep that walking on it was impossible antoine therefore proceeded to cut steps along its face  two swings of his ponderous mountainaxe were sufficient to cut each step in the brittle ice and in a few minutes the whole party were on the slope every man having a coil of the rope round his waist while with the spike of his alpenstock driven firmly into the ice he steadied himself before taking each successive step  there would have been no difficulty in crossing such a slope if its base had terminated in snow but as it went straight down to the brow of an iceprecipice and then abruptly terminated in a cornice from which the giant icicles before mentioned hung down into an unfathomable abyss each man knew that a false step a slip or the loss of balance might result in the instant destruction of the whole party  they moved therefore very slowly keeping their eyes steadily fixed on their feet  the mercurial temperament of mr slingsby was severely tried at this point  his desire to look up and revel in the beauties of nature around him proved too strong a temptation  while gazing with feelings of awe at the terrible edge or cornice below he became for the first time fully alive to his situationthe smallness of the step of ice on which he stood the exceeding steepness of the glassy slope below the dread abyss beyond  he shut his eyes a giddy feeling came over hima rush of horror  take care monsieur was uttered in a quick deep tone behind him  it was the warning voice of le croix who observed his condition  the warning came too late  slingsby wavered threw up his arms slipped and fell with an appalling shriek  le croix however was prepared  in an instant he had fixed his staff and heels firmly and had leaned well back to resist the pull  the porter in front was not less prompt the stout rope stood the strain and in another moment the artist was restored to his position panting pale and humbled  a few minutes sufficed to restore his confidence sufficiently to admit of his proceeding and with many warnings to be more cautious the advance was continued  up to this point the weather had favoured them but now mont blanc seemed as if inclined to resent the free and easy way in which these men of mingled muscle and science had attacked his crown  he drew several ominous clouds around him and shook out a flood of hoary locks from his white head which caught up by a blast created apparently for the purpose were whirled aloft in wild confusion and swooped down upon the mountaineers with bitter emphasis in the form of snowdrift as if they had come direct from captain woppers favourite place of reference nova zembla  coats which had hitherto been carried on the arm or thrown open were put on and buttoned and heads were bent to meet the blast and repel the snowdrift  little was said save a murmured doubt by antoine as to the possibility of gaining the summit even although they were now so near it for the day was far spent by that time and the rugged nature of the route over they had passed precluded the possibility of a rapid return to the hut at the grands mulets  they pushed steadily on however for the professor was anxious to bury his thermometer in the snow at the top the guide was anxious to maintain his credit for perseverance and the others were anxious to be able to say they had reached the highest height in europe  in any weather the ascent of mont blanc requires somewhat more than the average share of physical vigour and perseverance in bad weather it demands unusual strength and resolution  when therefore a severe storm of wind arose most of the party began to show symptoms of distress  the labour of ascending being coupled with that of forcing way against the blast was very exhausting to the muscles while the extreme cold reduced the physical energy and cooled the most sanguine spirit  antoine alone seemed to be proof against all influences but the responsibility lying on him clouded his usually open countenance with a careworn expression  prudence counselled immediate return ambition as they were now so near the top urged prolonged effort  the guide expressed his anxieties but meeting with no response followed the dictates of his feelings and pushed on  like pillars of living snow they toiled patiently upwards  breath became too precious to waste in words  they advanced in silence  the wind howled around them and the snow circled in mad evolutions as if the demon of wintry storms dwelt there and meant to defend his citadel to the bitter end  there are two rocks near the summit which crop through the ice like rugged jewels in the monarchs diadem  the lower is named the petits mulets the upper the derniers roches  on reaching the latter of these they paused a few moments to rest  a feeling of certainty that the end would be gained now began to prevail but the guide was a little alarmed and the professor horrified on looking at their companions faces to observe that they were pinched haggard and oldlooking as if they all had aged somewhat during the last few hours captain woppers rubicund visage was pale and his nose blue the face of lewis was white all over and drawn as if he were suffering pain dr lawrences countenance was yellow and slingsbys was green  the professor himself was as bad as his comrades and the porters were no better  we shant be beaten now said the man of science with a ghastly smile  go head nevr sdie slngs thrs shot n th locker replied the captain in the tone of a man who would rather avoid speaking if possible  what a face youve got stoutley said the artist  youre another replied lewis with a horrible grin  allons exclaimed the guide bending once more against the storm  once for a few minutes the wind ceased and the clouds lifted  captain wopper uttered a cheer and rushed forward in advance of the guide took off his hat and threw it into the air  they had reached the round summit without being aware of it  they stood 15781 feet above the sealevel  no envious peak rose above their heads  the whole world lay below them bathed too in bright sunshine for the storm which had so suddenly swooped upon them was confined like an elemental bodyguard to the head of the mountainking  but clear though it was at the moment they were too high in the air to see anything quite distinctly yet this hazy aspect had a charm of its own for it increased the feeling and idea of vastness in connection with surrounding space around and now beneath stood the mountain nobility of the land looking however somewhat reduced in size and majesty as seen from the royal presence  scarcely had the mountaineers assembled and glanced at the wondrous panorama when the envious clouds swooped down again and mingled with the snowdrift which once more rose to meet them  we must be quick monsieur said antoine taking a shovel from one of the porters while le croix grasped another  where shall we dig  the professor fixed on a spot and while the grave of the thermometer was being dug a plaid was set up on a couple of alpenstocks in the shelter of which the others consumed the bread and wine that had been saved from breakfast  it did them little good however the cold was too intense  the captains beard was already fringed with icicles and the whiskers of those who had them were covered with hoarfrost while the breath issued from their mouths like steam  before the thermometer was buried all had risen and were endeavouring to recover heat by rubbing their hands beating their arms across their breasts and stamping violently  come said the professor quickly when the work was done we must start at once  oui monsieur assented the guide and without more words the whole party began to descend the mountain at a run  there was cause for haste  not only did the storm increase in violence but evening drew on apace and all of them were more or less exhausted by prolonged muscular exertion and exposure to severe cold  suddenly having gone a considerable way down the mountain they emerged from fog and snowdrift into blazing sunshine  the strife of elements was confined entirely to the summit  the inferior iceslopes and the valleys far below were bathed in the golden glories of a magnificent sunset and before they reached the huts at the grands mulets they had passed from a condition of excessive cold to one of extreme heat insomuch that the captain and professor were compelled to walk with their coats slung over their shoulders while perspiration streamed from their bare brows  that night the party slept again at the grands mulets and next day they reached chamouni fagged no doubt and bearing marks of mountaineering in the shape of sunburnt cheeks and peeled noses but hearty nevertheless and not a little elated with their success in having scaled the mighty sides and the hoary summit of mont blanc    chapter sixteen  tells how lewis distinguished himself  seated one morning on an easy chair in susan quicks apartment and swinging his little blue legs to and fro in a careless negligent manner gillie white announced it as his opinion that mister lewis had gone or was fast going mad  why do you think so asked susan with a smile looking up for a moment from some portion of lewiss nether integuments which mont blanc had riven almost to shreds  wy do i think so repeated gillie wy cos hes not content with havin busted his boots an his close an all but busted hisself in goin to the top o mont blang an monty rosa an all the other montythingumbobs about but hes agoin off to day with that queer fish laycrwa to hunt some where up above the cloudsin among the stars i fancyfor shamwas  indeed said susan with a neat little laugh  yes indeed  hes mountainmadmad as a swiss march hare if not madderby the way susan wot dee think o the french  gillie propounded this question with the air of a philosopher  dyou mean french people  no i means the french lingo as my friend cappen wopper calls it  well i cant say that i have thought much about it yet  missis keeps me so busy that i havent time  ah said gillie youre wastin of precious opportoonities susan ive bin astuddyin of that lingo myself now for three weeksoff and on  indeed exclaimed susan with an amused glance and what do you think of it  think of it  i think its the most outrageous stuff as ever was  the man who first inwented it must ave ad pralersis o the brain besides a bad cold in is ead for most o the enns an gees come tumblin through the nose but only git half out after all as if the speaker was afraid to let em go lest he shouldnt git hold of em again  theres that there mountain now  they cant call it mont blang with a good strong outanout bang like a briton would do but they catches hold o the gee when its got about as far as the bridge o the nose half throttles it and shoves it right back so that you can scarce hear it at all  an the best joke is there aint no gee in the word at all  no said susan in surprise  no repeated gillie  ive bin studdyin the spellin o the words in shopwinders an posters an would you blieve it they end the word blang with a c  you dont say so  yes i do an how dee think they spell the name o that feller laycrwa  im sure i dont know answered susan  they spells it returned gillie with a solemn look lecroix now if i had spelt it that way id have pronounced it laycroiks wouldnt you  well yes i think i should said susan  it seems to me continued gillie that they goes on the plan of spellin one way an purnouncin anotheralways takin care to choose the most difficult way an the most unnattral so that a feller has no chance to come near it except by corkin up one nostril tight an borin a small extra hole in the other about halfway up  if you was to mix a sneeze with what you said an paid little or no attention to the sense praps it would be frenchbut i aint sure  i only wish you heard cappen wopper hoistin french out of hisself as if he was a wessel shorthanded an every word was a heavy bale  hes werry shy about it is the cappen an wouldnt for the world say a word if he thought any one was near but when he thinks hes alone with antoinethats our guide you knowhe sometimes lets fly a broadside o french that wellnigh takes my breath away  the urchin broke into a laugh here at the memory of the captains efforts to master what he styled a furrin tongue but susan checked him by saying slily how could you know gillie if the captain was alone with antoine  oh dont you know replied gillie trying to recover his gravity the cappen hes wery fond o me and i like to gratify his feelins by keepin near him  sometimes i keep so nearunder the shadow of his huge calf dee seethat he dont observe me on lookin round an thinkin hes all alone lets fly his french broadsides in a way that amost sends antoine on his beamends  but antoine is tough he is  he ginrally says i not unrstan english ver well shakes his head an grins but the cappen never listens to his answers bein too busy loadin and primin for another broadside  the man to whom he referred cut short the conversation at this point by shouting down the stair  hallo  gillie you powdermonkey where are my shoes  here they are cappen all ready fit to do dooty as a lookinglass to shave yerself cried the powdermonkey leaping up and leaving the room abruptly  gillies opinion in regard to the madness of lewis was shared by several of his friends above stairs  doctor lawrence especially felt much anxiety about him having overheard one or two conversations held by the guides on the subject of the young englishmans recklessness  really lewis said the doctor on one occasion you must listen to a lecture from me because you are in a measure under my charge  im all attention sir said lewis meekly as he sat down on the edge of his bed and folded his hands in his lap  well then to begin said the doctor with a halfserious smile i wont trouble you with my own opinion to which you attach no weight  pardon me lawrence i attach great weight to itor rather it has so much weight that i can scarcely bear it  just so and therefore you shant have it  but you must admit that the opinion of a good guide is worth something  now i heard antoine grennon the other day laying down some unquestionable principles to the professor  what lecturing the professor interrupted lewis how very presumptuous  he said continued the doctor that the dangers connected with the ascent of these swiss mountains are real and unless properly provided against may become terrible if not fatal  he instanced your own tendency to go roving about among the glaciers alone  with a comrade or a guide attached to you by a rope there is no danger worth speaking of but it must be as clear to you as it is to me that it when out on the mountains alone you step on a snowcovered crevasse and break through your instant death is inevitable  yes but objected lewis with that unwillingness to be convinced which is one of the chief characteristics of youth i always walk when alone on the glaciers with the utmost caution sounding the snow in front of me with the long handle of my axe at every step as i go  if the guides do not find this always a sufficient protection for themselves by what amazing power of selfsufficiency do you persuade yourself that it is sufficient for you demanded lawrence  your question suffices doctor said lewis laughing go on with your lecture im all attention and and humility  not my lecture retorted lawrence the guides  he was very strong i assure you on the subject of men going on the high glaciers without a rope or which comes to the same thing alone and he was not less severe on those who are so foolhardy or so ignorant as to cross steep slopes of ice on newfallen snow  nothing is easier the new snow affording such good foothold as you told us the other day when describing your adventures under the cliffs of monte rosa and yet nothing is more dangerous says antoine for if the snow were to slip as it is very apt to do you would be smothered in it or swept into a crevasse by it  lives are lost in the alps every year i am told owing to indifference to these two points  the guides sayand their opinions are corroborated by men of science and alpine experiencethat it is dangerous to meddle with any slope exceeding 30 degrees for several days after a heavy fall and yet it is certain that slopes exceeding this angle are traversed annually by travellers who are ignorant or reckless or both  did you not say that the slope which you crossed the other day was a steeper angle than this and the snow on it not more than twentyfour hours old  guilty exclaimed lewis with a sigh  i condemn you then said lawrence with a smile to a continuation of this lecture and be assured the punishment is much lighter than you deserve  listenthere are three unavoidable dangers in alpine climbing  please dont be long on each head pleaded lewis throwing himself back in his bed while his friend placed the point of each finger of his right hand on a corresponding point of the left and crossed his legs  i wont  i shall be briefbrief as your life is likely to be if you dont attend to me  the three dangers are as i have said unavoidable but two of them may be guarded against the other cannot  first there is danger from falling rocks  this danger may be styled positive  it hangs over the head like the sword of damocles  there is no avoiding it except by not climbing at all for boulders and iceblocks are perched here and there and everywhere and no one can tell the moment when they shall fall  secondly there is danger from crevassesthe danger of tumbling into one when crossing a bridge of snow and the danger of breaking through a crust of snow which conceals one  this may be called a negative danger  it is reduced to almost nothing if you are tied to your comrade by a rope and if the leader sounds with his staff as he walks along but it changes from a negative to a positive danger to the man who is so mad as to go out alone  thirdly there is danger from new snow on steep slopes which is positive if you step on it when recently fallen and when the slope is very steep but is negative when you allow sufficient time for it to harden  while however it is certain that many deaths occur from these three dangers being neglected it is equally true that the largest number of accidents which occur in the alps arise chiefly from momentary indiscretions from false steps the result of carelessness or selfconfidence and from men attempting to do what is beyond their powers  men who are too old for such fatigue and men who though young are not sufficiently strong usually come to grief  i close my lecture with a quotation from the writings of a celebrated mountaineerin all cases the man rather than the mountain is at fault  there is truth in what you say observed lewis rising with a yawn  nay but returned his friend seriously your mother who is made very anxious by your reckless expeditions begged me to impress these truths on you  will you promise me like a good fellow to consider them  i promise said lewis becoming serious in his turn and taking his friends hand but you must not expect sudden perfection to be exemplified in mecome lets go have a talk with le croix about his projected expedition after the chamois  up in the mountains nowabove some of the clouds undoubtedly almost mong the stars as gillie put itlewis wanders in company with baptist le croix halfforgetful of his promise to lawrence  below them lies a world of hills and valleys above towers a fairyland of ice cliff and cloud  no human habitation is near  the only indications of mans existence are so faint and so far off in the plains below that houses are barely visible and villages look like toys  a sea of cloud floats beneath them and it is only through gaps in this sea that the terrestrial world is seen  piercing through it are the more prominent of the alpine peaksthe dark tremendous obelisk of the matterhorn towering in one direction the not less tremendous and far grander head of mont blanc looming in another  the sun shines brightly over all piercing and rendering semitransparent some of the clouds gilding the edges and deepening the shadows of others  do you see anything le croix asked lewis as he reclined on a narrow ledge of rock recovering breath after a fatiguing climb while his comrade peered intently through a telescope into the recesses of a dark mountain gorge that lay a little below them  for some moments the hunter made no reply  presently he closed the glass and with an air of satisfaction said chamois  where asked lewis rising eagerly and taking the glass  le croix carefully pointed out the spot but no effort on the part of the inexperienced youth could bring anything resembling the light and graceful form of a chamois into the field of vision  never mind le croix he said quickly returning the glass and picking up his rifle come along lets have at them  softly returned the hunter we must get well to leeward of them before we can venture to approach  lead where you will youll find me a quiet and unquestioning follower  the hunter at once turned and descending the mountain by a precipice which was so steep that they had in some places to drop from ledge to ledge at last gained a position where the light air that floated but scarce moved the clouds came direct from the spot where the chamois lay  he then turned and made straight towards them  as they advanced the ground became more rugged and precipitous so that their progress was unavoidably slow and rendered more so by the necessity that lay on them of approaching their game without noise  when they had reached a spot where a sheer precipice appeared to render further progress impossible the hunter stopped and said in a low tone look they are too far off a bullet could not reach them  lewis craned his neck over the cliff and saw the chamois grazing quietly on a small patch of green that lay among brown rocks below  whats to be done he asked anxiously  couldnt we try a long shot  useless  your eyes are inexperienced  the distance is greater than you think  what then shall we do  le croix did not answer  he appeared to be revolving some plan in his mind  turning at last to his companion he said  i counsel that you remain here  it is a place near to which they must pass if driven by some one from below  i will descend  but how descend asked lewis  i see no path by which even a goat could get down  leave that to me replied the hunter  keep perfectly still till you see them within range  have your rifle ready do not fire in haste there will be time for a slow and sure aim  most bad hunters owe their illluck to haste  with this advice le croix crept quietly round a projecting rock and dropping apparently over the precipice disappeared  solitude is suggestive  as long as his companion was with him lewis felt careless and easy in mind but now that he was left alone in one of the wildest and grandest scenes he had yet beheld he became solemnised and could not help feeling that without his guide he would be very helpless in such a place  being alone in the mountains was not indeed new to him  as we have already said he had acquired the character of being much too reckless in wandering about by himself but there was a vast difference between going alone over ground which he had traversed several times with guides in the immediate neighbourhood of chamouni and being left in a region to which he had been conducted by paths so intricate tortuous and difficult that the mere effort to trace back in memory even the last few miles of the route confused him  there was a mysterious stillness too about everything around him and the fogs which floated in heavy masses above and below gave a character of changeful wildness to the scenery  what a place to get lost in and benighted he thought  then his mind with that curious capacity for sudden flight which is one of the chief characteristics of thought leaped down the precipices up which he had toiled so slowly sped away over hill and dale and landed him in chamouni at the feet of nita horetzki  once there he had no desire to move  he kept looking steadily in her pretty face speculated as to the nature of the charm that rendered it so sweet wondered what was the cause of the lines of care that at times rippled her smooth white brow longed to become the sharer of her grief and her comforter and pondered the improbability of his ever being in a position to call her nitadarling nitasweetest nitaexquisite nita  he was still engaged in creating adjectives at chamouni when he was brought suddenly back to the alpine heights by the sound of a shot  it was repeated in a hundred echoes by the surrounding cliffs as he seized his rifle and gazed over the precipice  a puff of smoke hanging like a cloudlet guided his eyes  not far in front of it he saw the fawnlike form of a chamois stretched in death upon the ground while two others were seen bounding with amazing precision and elasticity over the rocks towards him  he turned at once to an opening among the rocks at his right for even to his unpractised eye it was obviously impossible that anything without wings could approach him in front or at his left  coolness and promptitude were characteristics of the youth so that he sat crouching with the rifle resting in the palm of his left hand over one knee as motionless as if he had been chiselled from the rock against which he leaned but his natural coolness of deportment could not prevent though it concealed a throbbing of anxiety lest the game should pass out of reach or behind rocks which would prevent his seeing it  for an instant he halfrose intending to rush to some more commanding elevation but remembering the parting advice of le croix he sank down again and remained steady  scarcely had he done so when the clatter of bounding hoofs was heard he knew well that the open space across which he now felt sure the chamois must pass was only broad enough to afford the briefest possible time for an aim  he raised the rifle more than halfway to the shoulder  another instant and a chamois appeared like an arrow shooting athwart the hillside before him  he fired and missed  the bullet however which had been destined for the heart of the first animal was caught in the brain of that which followed  it sprang high into the air and rolling over several times lay stretched at full length on the rocks  we need not pause to describe the rejoicing of the young sportsman over his first chamois or to detail lecroixs complimentary observations thereon  having deposited their game in a place of safety the hunter suggested that as there was no chance of their seeing any more in that locality it would be well to devote the remainder of the day to exploring the higher slopes of a neighbouring glacier for familiar as he was with all the grander features of the region there were some of the minuter details he said with which he was unacquainted  lewis was a little surprised at the proposal but being quite satisfied with his success and not unwilling to join in anything that smacked of exploration he readily assented and ere long the two aspiring spirits were high above the spot where the chamois had fallen and struggling with the difficulties of couloir and crevasse  before quitting the lower ground they had deposited their game and rifles in a cave well known to le croix in which they intended to pass the night and they now advanced armed only with their longhandled alpine hatchets without which implements it is impossible to travel over glaciers  being both of them strong in wind and limb they did not pause often to rest though lewis occasionally called a momentary halt to enjoy the magnificent prospect  during one of these pauses a dark object was seen moving over the ice far below them  le croix pointed to it and said that it approached them  what is ita crow asked lewis  more like a man but it is neither returned the hunter adjusting his telescope yes it is as i fancied a chamois  then it cannot have seen us said lewis else it would not approach  nay it approaches because it has seen us  it mistakes us for relatives  let us sit down to deceive it a little  they crouched beside a piece of ice and the chamois advanced until its pretty form became recognisable by the naked eye  its motions however were irregular  it was evidently timid  sometimes it came on at full gallop then paused to look and uttered a loud piping sound advancing a few paces with caution and pausing to gaze again  le croix replied with an imitative whistle to its call  it immediately bounded forward with pleasure but soon again hesitated and stopped  at last it seemed to become aware of its mistake for turning at a tangent it scoured away over the ice like wind swooping down from the mountainsummits bounded over the crevasses like an indiarubber ball and was quickly out of sight  while gazing with profound interest at this graceful creature the explorers were not at first aware that a dark mass of inky cloud was rapidly bearing down on them and that one of those wild storms which sweep frequently over the high alps seemed to be gathering  we must make haste if we would gain the shelter of our cave said le croix rising  as he spoke a low rumbling sound was heard behind them  they turned just in time to see a small avalanche of rocks hopping down the cliffs towards them  it was so far off and looked such an innocent rolling of pebbles that lewis regarded it as an insignificant phenomenon  his companion formed a better estimate of its character but being at least five hundred yards to one side of the couloir or snowslope down which it rushed he judged that they were safe  he was mistaken  some of the largest stones flew past quite near them several striking the glacier as they passed and sending clouds of icedust over them and one as large as a hogshead bounding with awful force straight over their heads  they turned instantly to hasten from so dangerous a spot but were arrested by another and much louder rumbling sound  quick fly monsieur exclaimed le croix setting his young companion the example  truly there was cause for haste  a subglacial lake among the heights above had burst its icy barriers and down the same couloir from which the smaller avalanche had sprung a very ocean of boulders mud ice and debris came crashing and roaring with a noise like the loudest thunder with this difference that there was no intermission of the roar for full quarter of an hour only at frequent intervals a series of preeminent peals were heard when boulders from six to ten feet in diameter met with obstacles and dashed them aside or broke themselves into atoms  our hunters fled for their lives and barely gained the shelter of a giant boulder when the skirts of the hideous torrent roared past leaped over an icecliff and was swallowed up by the insatiable crevasses of the glacier below  for several minutes after they had reached and stood panting in a position of safety they listened to the thunderous roar of alpine artillery until it died slowly awayas if unwillingly in the light pattering of pebbles  gratitude to the almighty for deliverance from a great danger was the strongest feeling in the heart of the chamoishunter  profound astonishment and joy at having witnessed such an amazing sight quickened the pulse of lewis  that was a narrow escape le croix  it was  i never see such a sight without a shudder because i lost a brother in such an avalanche  it was on the slopes of the jungfrau  he was literally broken to fragments by it  lewis expressed sympathy and his feelings were somewhat solemnised by the graphic recital of the details of the sad incident with which the hunter entertained him as they descended the mountain rapidly  in order to escape an impending storm which was evidently brewing in the clouds above lewis suggested that they should diverge from the route by which they had ascended and attempt a short cut by a steeper part of the mountains  le croix looked round and pondered  i dont like diverging into unknown parts when in a hurry and with the day far spent he said one never knows when a sheer precipice will shut up the way in places like this  the youth however was confident and the man of experience was too amiable and yielding  there was also urgent reason for haste  it was therefore decided that the steeper slopes should be attempted  they began with a glissade  a very steep snowslope happened to be close at hand  it stretched uninterruptedly down several hundred feet to one of the terraces into which the precipitous mountainside at that place was cut  will you try asked le croix looking doubtfully at his companion  of course i will replied lewis shortly  where you choose to go i will follow  have you ever done such work before  yes often though never on quite so steep or long a slope  le croix was apparently satisfied  he sat down on the summit of the slope fixed the spiked end of his axe in the snow resting heavily on the handle in order to check his descent and hitched himself forward  keep steady and dont roll over he cried as he shot away  the snow rose and trailed like a white tail behind him  his speed increased almost to that of an avalanche and in a few seconds he was at the bottom  lewis seated himself in precisely the same manner but overbalanced himself when halfway down swung round lost selfcommand let slip his axe and finally went head over heels with legs and arms flying wildly  le croix halfexpecting something of the kind was prepared  he had reascended the slope a short way and received the human avalanche on his right shoulder was knocked down violently as a matter of course and the two went spinning in a heap together to the bottom  not hurt i hope cried lewis jumping up and looking at his comrade with some anxiety  no monsieur replied le croix quietly as he shook the snow from his garmentsand you  oh  im all right  that was a splendid beginning  we shall get down to our cave in no time at this rate  the hunter shook his head  it is not all glissading he said as they continued the descent by clambering down the face of a precipice  some thousands of feet below them lay the tortuous surface of a glacier on which they hoped to be able to walk towards their intended nightbivouac but the cliffs leading to this grew steeper as they proceeded  some hours work was before them ere the glacier could be reached and the day was already drawing towards its close  a feeling of anxiety kept them both silent as they pushed on with the utmost possible speed save when it was necessary for one to direct the other as to his foothold  on gaining each successive ledge of the terraced hillside they walked along it in the hope of reaching better ground or another snowslope but each ledge ended in a precipice so that there was no resource left but to scramble down to the ledge below to find a similar disappointment  the slopes also increased rather than decreased in steepness yet so gradually that the mountaineers at last went dropping from point to point down the sheer cliffs without fully realising the danger of their position  at a certain point they came to the head of a slope so steep that the snow had been unable to lie on it and it was impossible to glissade on the pure ice  it was quite possible however to cut footholes down  le croix had with him a stout manilla rope of about three hundred feet in length  with this tied round his waist and lewis firmly planted holding on to it he commenced the staircase two blows sufficed for each step yet two hours were consumed before the work was finished  reascending he tied the rope round lewis and thus enabled him to descend with a degree of confidence which he could not have felt if unattached  le croix himself descended without this moral support but being as surefooted as a chamois it mattered little  pretty well exhausted by their exertions they now found themselves at the summit of a precipice so perpendicular and unbroken that a single glance sufficed to convince them of the utter impossibility of further descent in that quarter  the ledge on which they stood was not more than three feet broad  below them the glacier appeared in the fading light to be as far off as ever  above the cliffs frowned like inaccessible battlements  they were indeed like flies clinging to a wall and to add to their difficulties the storm which had threatened now began in earnest  a cloud as black as pitch hung in front of them  suddenly from its heart there gushed a blinding flash of lightning followed almost without interval by a crash of thunder  the echoes took up the sounds hurling them back and forward among the cliffs as if cyclopean mountain spirits were playing tennis with boulders  rain also descended in torrents and for some time the whole scene became as dark as if overspread with the wing of night  crouching under a slight projection of rock the explorers remained until the first fury of the squall was over  fortunately it was as shortlived as violent but its effects were disagreeable for cataracts now poured on them as they hurried along the top of the precipice vainly looking for a way of escape  at last on coming to one of those checks which had so often met them that day le croix turned and said  there is no help for it monsieur we must spend the night here  here exclaimed lewis glancing at the cliffs above and the gulf below  it is not a pleasant restingplace replied the hunter with a sad smile but we cannot go on  it will be quite dark in half an hour when an effort to advance would insure our destruction  the little light that remains must be spent in seeking out a place to lie on  the two men who were thrown thus together in such perilous circumstances were possessed of more than average courage yet it would be false to say that fear found no place in their breasts  on the contrary each confessed to the other the following day that his heart had sunk within him as he thought of the tremendous cliffs against which they were stuck with descent and ascent equally impossible a narrow ledge on the precipiceedge for their bed and a long wild night before them  cowardice does not consist in simple fear  it consists in the fear of trifles in unreasonable fear and in such fear as incapacitates a man for action  the situation of our explorers was not one of slight danger  they had the best of reason for anxiety because they knew not whether escape even in daylight were possible  as to incapacity for action the best proof that fear had not brought them to that condition lay in the fact that they set about preparations for spending the night with a degree of vigour amounting almost to cheerfulness  after the most careful survey only one spot was found wider than the rest of the ledge and it was not more than four feet wide the difference being caused by a slight hollow under the rock which thus might overhang themone of them at leastand form a sensation of canopy  at its best a bed only four feet wide is esteemed narrow enough for one and quite inadequate for two but when it is considered that the bed now selected was of hard granite rather roundbacked than flat with a sheer precipice descending a thousand feet more or less on one side of it and a slope in that direction there will be no difficulty in conceiving something of the state of mind in which lewis stoutley and baptist le croix lay down to repose till morning in wet garments with the thermometer somewhere between thirtytwo and zero fahrenheit  to prevent their rolling off the ledge when asleep they built on the edge of the cliff a wall of the largest loose stones they could find it was but an imaginary protection at best for the slightest push sent some of the stones toppling over and it necessarily curtailed the available space  no provisions save one small piece of bread had been brought as they had intended returning to their cave to feast luxuriously  having eaten the bread they prepared to lie down  it was agreed that only one at a time should sleep the other was to remain awake to prevent the sleeper from inadvertently moving  it was also arranged that he whose turn it was to sleep should lie on the inner side  but here arose a difference  le croix insisted that lewis should have the first sleep  lewis on the other hand declared that he was not sleepy that the attempt to sleep would only waste the time of both and that therefore le croix should have the first  the contention was pretty sharp for a time but the obstinacy of the englishman prevailed  the hunter gave in and at once lay down straight out with his face to the cliff and as close to it as he could squeeze lewis immediately lay down outside of him and throwing one arm over his lecroixs broad chest gave him a halfjocular hug that a bear might have enjoyed and told him to go to sleep  in doing this he dislodged a stone from the outer wall which went clattering down into the dark gulf  almost immediately the deep regular breathing of the wearied hunter told that he was already in the land of nod  it was a strange romantic position and lewis rejoiced in the midst of his anxieties as he lay there wakefully guarding the chamoishunter while he slept  it appeared to lewis that his companion felt the need of a guardian for he grasped with both hands the arm which he had thrown round him  how greatly he wished that his friends at chamouni could have even a faint conception of his position that night  what would lawrence have thought of it  and the captainhow would he have conducted himself in the circumstances  his mother emma the count antoine gillie susanevery one had a share in his thoughts as he lay wakeful and watching on the giddy ledgeand nita as a great undercurrent like the subglacial rivers kept flowing continually and twining herself through all  mingled with these thoughts was the sound of avalanches which ever and anon broke in upon the still night with a muttering like distant thunder or with a startling roar as masses of ice tottered over the brinks of the cascades or boulders loosened by the recent rain lost their hold and involved a host of smaller fry in their fall  twining and tying these thoughts together into a wild entanglement quite in keeping with the place the youth never for one moment lost the sense of an ever present and imminent dangerhe scarce knew whatand the necessity for watchfulness  this feeling culminated when he beheld nita horetzki suddenly appear standing close above him on a most dangerouslooking ledge of rock  uttering a loud cry of alarm he sought to start up and in so doing sent threequarters of the protecting wall down the precipice with an appalling rush and rumble  unquestionably he would have followed it if he had not been held by the wrist as if by a vice  hallo take care monsieur cried le croix in a quick anxious tone still holding tightly to his companions arm  why what  le croixi sawiisawwell welli do really believe i have beenim ashamed to say  yes monsieur youve been asleep said the hunter with a quiet laugh gently letting go his hold of the arm as he became fully persuaded that lewis was by that time quite awake and able to take care of himself  have you been asleep too asked lewis  truly no replied the hunter rising with care but you have had full three hours of it so its my turn now  you dont say so exclaimed lewis  indeed i do and now please get next the cliff and let me lie outside so that i may rest with an easy mind  lewis opposed him no longer  he rose and they both stood up to stamp their feet and belabour their chests for some timethe cold at such a height being intense while their wet garments and want of covering rendered them peculiarly unfitted to withstand it  the effort was not very successful  the darkness of the night the narrowness of their ledge and the sleepiness of their spirits rendering extreme caution necessary  at last the languid blood began to flow a moderate degree of warmth was restored and lying down again side by side in the new position the hunter and the student sought and found repose    chapter seventeen  danger and death on the glacier  daylightblessed daylight  how often longed for by the sick and weary how imperfectly appreciated by those whose chief thoughts and experiences of night are fitly expressed by the couplet    bed bed delicious bed   haven of rest for the weary head  daylight came at last to the intense relief of poor lewis who had become restless as the interminable night wore on and the cold seemed to penetrate to his very marrow  although unable to sleep however he lay perfectly still being anxious not to interrupt the rest of his companion  but le croix like the other did not sleep soundly he awoke several times and towards morning began to dream and mutter short sentences  at first lewis paid no attention to this but at length becoming weary of his own thoughts he set himself with a halfamused feeling to listen  the amusement gave place to surprise and to a touch of sadness when he found that the word gold frequently dropped from the sleepers lips  can it be he thought that this poor fellow is really what they say a halfcrazed goldhunter  i hope not  it seems nonsensical  i never heard of there being gold in these mountains  yet it may be so and too much longing after gold is said to turn people crazy  i shouldnt wonder if it did  thoughts are proverbial wanderers and of a wayward spirit and not easy of restraint  they are often very honest too and refuse to flatter as the youth lay on his back gazing dreamily from that giddy height on the first faint tinge of light that suffused the eastern sky his thoughts rambled on in the same channel  strange that a chamoishunter should become a goldhunter  how much more respectable the former occupation and yet how many goldhunters there are in the world  gamblers are goldhunters and i was a gambler once  aha  mr lewis the cap once fitted you  fitted did i say  it fits still  have i not been playing billiards every night nearly since i came here despite captain woppers warnings and the lesson i got from poor leven  poor leven indeed its little gold that he has and i robbed him  however i paid him back thats one comfort and my stakes now are mere triflesjust enough to give interest to the game  yet shame on you lewie cant you take interest in a game for its own sake the smallest coin staked involves the spirit of gambling  you shouldnt do it my boy you know that well enough if youd only let your conscience speak out  and nita seems not to like it tooah nita shes as good as goldas good ten million times better than the finest gold  i wonder why that queer careworn look comes over her angel face when she hears me say that ive been having a game of billiards  i might whisper some flattering things to myself in reference to this were it not that she seems just as much put out when any one else talks about it  ah nita  it is unnecessary to follow the youths thoughts further for having got upon nita they immediately ceased their wayward wandering practices and remained fixed on that theme  soon afterwards the light being sufficient the mountaineers rose and continued their descent which was accomplished after much toil and trouble and they proceeded at a quick pace over the glacier towards the place where the chamois had been left the previous day  why are you so fond of gold le croix said lewis abruptly and in a halfjesting tone as they walked along  the hunters countenance flushed deeply and he turned with a look of severity towards his companion  who said that i was fond of it  a very good friend of mine replied lewis with a light laugh  he can be no friend of mine returned the hunter with contracted brows  im not so sure of that said the other at least if you count yourself a friend  you whispered so much about gold in your dreams this morning that i came to the conclusion you were rather fond of it  the expression of the hunter changed completely  there seemed to be a struggle between indignation and sorrow in his breast as he stopped and facing his companion said with vehemence  monsieur i do not count myself a friend  i have ever found self to be my greatest enemy  the good god knows how hard i have fought against self for years and how oftenoh how ofteni have been beaten down and overcome  god help me  it is a weary struggle  lecroixs countenance and tones changed as rapidly as the cloudforms on his own mountain peaks  his last words were uttered with the deepest pathos and his now pale face was turned upward as if he sought for hope from a source higher than the everlasting hills  lewis was amazed at the sudden burst of feeling in one who was unusually quiet and sedate and stood looking at him in silence  young man resumed the hunter in a calmer tone laying his large brown hand impressively on the youths shoulder you have heard aright i have loved gold too much  if i had resisted the temptation at the first i might have escaped but i shall yet be saved ay despite of self for there is a saviour  for years i have sought for gold among these mountains  they tell me it is to be found there but i have never found it  today i intended to have visited yonder yellow cliffs high up on the shoulder of the pass  do you see them  he pointed eagerly and a strange gleam was in his blue eyes as he went on to say rapidly and without waiting for an answer  i have not yet been up there  it looks a likely placea very likely placebut your words have turned me from my purpose  the evil spirit is gone for todayperhaps for ever  come he added in a tone of firm determination we will cross this crevasse and hasten down to the cave  he wrenched himself round while he spoke as if the hand of some invisible spirit had been holding him and hurried quickly towards a wide crevasse which crossed their path at that place  had we not better tie ourselves together before attempting it suggested lewis hastening after him  le croix did not answer but quickened his pace to a run  not there exclaimed lewis in sudden alarm  it is almost too wide for a leap and the snow on the other side overhangs  stop for gods sakenot there  he rushed forward but was too late  le croix was already on the brink of the chasm next moment with a tremendous bound he cleared it and alighted on the snow beyond  his weight snapped off the mass his arms were thrown wildly aloft and with a shout rather than a cry he fell headlong into the dark abyss  horrorstricken unable to move or cry out lewis stood on the edge from far down in the blue depths of the crevasse there arose a terrible sound as if of a heavy blow  it was followed by the familiar rattling of masses of falling ice which seemed to die away in the profound heart of the glacier  the weary struggle had come to an end at last  the chamoishunter had found a tomb like too many alas of his boldhearted countrymen among those great fields of ice over which he had so often sped with sure foot and cool head in days gone by  lewis was as thoroughly convinced that his late comrade was dead as if he had seen his mangled corpse before him but with a sort of passionate unbelief he refused to admit the fact  he stood perfectly motionless as if transfixed and frozen in the act of bending over the crevasse he listened intently and long for a sound which yet he knew could never come  an oppressive sickening silence reigned around him which he suddenly broke with a great and terrible cry as recovering from his stupor he hurried wildly to and fro seeking for some slope by which he might descend to the rescue of his friend  vainly he sought  both walls of the crevasse were sheer precipices of clear ice  at one spot indeed he found a short slope and madly seizing his axe he cut footholds down it descending quite regardless of danger until the slope became too perpendicular to admit of farther progress  struck then with alarm for himself he returned cautiously to the top while beads of cold perspiration stood on his pale brow  a few minutes more and he became sufficiently calm to realise the fact that poor le croix was indeed beyond all hope  as the truth was forced into his heart he covered his face with his hands and wept bitterly  it was long ere the passionate burst of feeling subsided  lewis was very impressionable and his young heart recoiled in agony from such a shock  although the hunter had been to him nothing but a pleasant guide he now felt as if he had lost a friend  when his mind was capable of connected thought he dwelt on the unfortunate mans kindly modest and bold disposition and especially on the incidents of the previous night when they two had lain side by side like brothers on their hard couch  at last he rose and with a feeling of dead weight crushing his spirit began to think of continuing his descent  he felt that although there was no hope of rescuing life still no time should be lost in rousing the guides of chamouni and recovering if possible the remains  other thoughts now came upon him with a rush  he was still high up among the great cliffs and alone  the vale of chamouni was still far distant and he was bewildered as to his route for in whatever direction he turned nothing met his eye save wildlyriven glaciers or jagged cliffs and peaks  he stood in the midst of a scene of savage grandeur which corresponded somewhat with his feelings  his knowledge of icecraft if we may use the expression was by that time considerable but he felt that it was not sufficient for the work that lay before him besides what knowledge he possessed could not make up for the want of a companion and a rope while to add to his distress weakness resulting partly from hunger began to tell on him  perhaps it was well that such thoughts interfered with those that unmanned him for they served to rouse his spirit and nerve him to exertion  feeling that his life under god depended on the wisdom vigour and promptitude of his actions during the next few hours he raised his eyes upward for a moment and perhaps for the first time in his life asked help and guidance of his creator with the feeling strong upon him that help and guidance were sorely needed  almost at the commencement of his descent an event occurred which taught him the necessity of extreme caution  this was the slipping of his axe he had left the fatal crevasse only a few hundred yards behind him when he came to a fracture in the ice that rendered it impossible to advance in that direction any longer he therefore turned aside but was met by a snow slope which terminated in another yawning crevasse  while standing on the top of this endeavouring to make up his mind as to the best route to be followed he chanced to swing his axe carelessly and let it fall  instantly it turned over the edge and shot like an arrow down the slope  he was iceman enough to know that the loss of his axe in such circumstances was equivalent to the signing of his deathwarrant and his face flushed with the gush of feeling that resulted from the accident  fortunately the head of the weapon caught on a lamp of ice just at the edge of the crevasse and the handle hung over it something akin to desperation now took possession of the youth  the slope was far too steep to slide down  not having his axe it was impossible to cut the necessary steps  in any case it was excessively dangerous for although the snow was not new it lay on such an incline that the least weight on it might set it in motion in which case inevitable death would have been the result  the case was too critical to admit of delay or thought  at all hazards the axe must be recovered he therefore lay down with his face to the slope and began to kick footholds with the toe of his boots  it was exceedingly slow and laborious work for he dared not to kick with all his force lest he should lose his balance and indeed he only retained it by thrusting both arms firmly into the upper holes and fixing one foot deep in a lower hole while with the other he cautiously kicked each new step in succession  at last after toiling steadily thus for two hours he regained his axe  the grip with which he seized the handle and the tender feeling with which he afterwards laid it on his shoulder created in him a new idea as to the strange affection with which man can be brought to regard inanimate objects and the fervency with which he condemned his former flippancy and vowed never more to go out on the high alps alone formed a striking commentary on the adage experience teaches fools  for some time after this lewis advanced with both speed and caution  at each point of vantage that he reached he made a rapid and careful survey of all the ground before him decided on the exact route which he should take as far as the eye could range and then refused every temptation to deviate from it save when insurmountable obstacles presented themselves in the shape of unbridged crevasses or sheer iceprecipices such obstacles were painfully numerous but by indomitable perseverance and sometimes by a desperate venture he overcame them  once he got involved in a succession of crevasses which ran into each other so that he found himself at last walking on the edge of a wedge of ice not a foot broad with unfathomable abysses on either side  the wedge terminated at last in a thin edge with a deep crevasse beyond  he was about to retrace his stepsfor the tenth time in that placewhen it struck him that if he could only reach the other side of the crevasse on his right he might gain a level patch of ice that appeared to communicate with the sounder part of the glacier beyond  he paused and drew his breath  it was not much of a leap  in ordinary circumstances he could have bounded over it like a chamois but he was weak now from hunger and fatigue besides which the wedge on which he stood was rotten and might yield to his bound while the opposite edge seemed insecure and might fail him like the mass that had proved fatal to le croix  he felt the venture to be desperate but the way before him was yet very long and the day was declining  screwing up his courage he sprang over and a powerful shudder shook his frame when he alighted safe on the other side  farther down the glacier he came to a level stretch and began to walk with greater speed neglecting for a little the precaution of driving the end of his axehandle into the snow in front at each step  the result was that he stepped suddenly on the snow that concealed a narrow crevasse  it sank at once sending something like a galvanic shock through his frame  the shock effected what his tired muscles might have failed to accomplish  it caused him to fling himself backward with catlike agility and thus he escaped narrowly  it is needless to say that thereafter he proceeded with a degree of care and caution that might have done credit even to a trained mountaineer  at last lewis found it necessary to quit the glacier and scale the mountains by way of a pass which led into the gorge from which he hoped to reach the vale of chamouni  he was in great perplexity here for the aspect of the country being unfamiliar to his eye he feared that he must have lost his way  nothing but decision however and prompt action could serve him now  to have vacillated or retraced part of his steps would have involved his spending a second night among the icy solitudes without shelter and this he felt fatigued and fasting as he was would have been quite beyond his powers of endurance  he therefore crossed the bergschrund or crevasse between the glacier and the cliffs on a snowbridge faced the mountainside once more and toiling upwards reached the summit of the pass a little before sunset fortunately the weather continued fine and the country below appeared much less rugged than that over which he had passed but he had not yet got clear of difficulties  just below him lay the longest iceslope or couloir he had hitherto encountered  the snow had been completely swept off its surface and it bore evidence of being the channel down which rushed the boulders and obelisks of ice that strewed the plain below  to reach that plain by any other route would have involved a circuit of unknown extent  the risk was great but the danger of delay was greater  he swung the heavy axe round his head and began at once the tedious process of cutting steps  being an apt scholar he had profited well from the lessons taught by le croix and others  quick yet measured and firm was each stroke  a forced calmness rested on his face for while the iceblocks above apparently nodding to their fall warned him to make haste the fear of slipping a foot or losing balance compelled him to be very cautious  in such a case a rope round the waist and a friend above would have been of inestimable value  when about twothirds of the way down the exhausted youth was forced to stop for a few seconds to rest  just then several pieces of ice the size of a mans head rushed down the couloir and dashed close past him they served to show the usual direction of an avalanche  fearing they were the prelude to something worse he quickly cut his way to the side of the couloir  he was not a moment too soon  glancing up in alarm he saw the foundations of one of the largest icemasses give way  the top bent over slowly at first then fell forward with a crash and broke into smaller fragments which dashed like lightning down the slope leaping from side to side and carrying huge rocks and masses of debris to the plain with horrible din  poor lewis felt his spirit and his body shrink  he had however chosen his position well  nothing save a cloud of dust and snow reached him but the part of the slope down which he had passed was swept clean as with the besom of destruction  it was an awful ordeal for one so young and inexperienced for the risk had to be encountered again  the sooner the better thought he and immediately swayed aloft his axe again lifting as he did so his heart to his maker for the second time that day  a few minutes more and he stood at the foot of the couloir  without a moments pause he hurried on and finally reached the lower slopes of the mountains  here to his inexpressible joy and thankfulness he fell in with a sheeptrack and following it up was soon on the highroad of the valley  but it was not till far on in the night that he reached chamouni scarce able to drag himself along  he went straight to the bureau of guides where a profound sensation was created by the sad tidings which he brought  antoine grennon happened to be there and to him lewis told his sad tale at the same time eagerly suggesting that an immediate search should be made for the body and offering to go back at once to guide them to the scene of the accident  antoine looked earnestly in the youths face  ah monsieur he said shaking his head you are not fit to guide any one tonight  besides i know the place well  if poor le croix has fallen into that crevasse he is now past all human aid  but why not start at once said lewis anxiously if there is but the merest vestige of a chance  there is no chance monsieur if your description is correct besides no man could find the spot in a dark night  but rest assured that we will not fail to do our duty to our comrade  a party will start off within an hour proceed as far as is possible during the night and at the first gleam of day we will push up the mountains  we need no one to guide us but you need rest  go in the morning you may be able to follow us  we need scarcely say that the search was unavailing  the body of the unfortunate hunter was never recovered  in all probability it still lies entombed in the ice of the great glacier    chapter eighteen  a mystery cleared up  is nita unwell emma asked lewis early one morning not long after the sad event narrated in the last chapter  i think not  she is merely depressed as we all are by the melancholy death of poor le croix  i can well believe it returned lewis  nevertheless it seems to me that her careworn expression and deep despondency cannot be accounted for by that event  you know that her father left last week very suddenly said emma perhaps there may be domestic affairs that weigh heavily on her  i know not for she never refers to her family or kindred  the only time i ventured to do so she appeared unhappy and quickly changed the subject  the cousins were sauntering near their hotel and observed dr lawrence hurry from the front door  hallo  lawrence called out lewis  ah the very man i want exclaimed the doctor hastening to join them do you know that miss horetzki is ill  how strange that we should just this moment have referred to her looking ill  not seriously ill i trust said emma with a troubled look in her sympathetic eyes  i hope not but her case puzzles me more than any that i have yet met with  i fancy it may be the result of an overstrained nervous system but there appears no present cause for that  she evidently possesses a vigorous constitution and every one here is kind to herher father particularly so  even if she were in love which she doesnt seem to be a faint twinkle in the doctors eye here that would not account for her condition  i cant help thinking observed lewis with a troubled look that her father is somehow the cause of her careworn looks  no doubt he is very kind to her in public but may there not be a very different state of things behind the scenes  i think not  the counts temper is gentle and his sentiments are good  if he were irascible there might be something behind the scenes for when restraint is removed and temper gets headway good principles may check but cannot always prevent unkindness  now emma i have sought you and lewis to ask for counsel  i do not say that nita is seriously ill but she is ill enough to cause those who love heras i know you dosome anxiety  it is very evident to me from what she says that she eagerly desires her father to be with her and yet when i suggest that he should be sent for she nervously declines to entertain the proposal  if this strange state of mind is allowed to go on it will aggravate the feverish attack from which she now suffers  i wish therefore to send for the count without letting her know  do you think this a wise step  undoubtedly but why ask such a question of me said emma with a look of surprise  first because you are nitas friendnot perhaps a friend of long standing but if i mistake not a very loving one and secondly as well as chiefly because i want you to find out from her where her father is at present and let me know  there is something disagreeably underhand in such a proceeding objected emma  you know that a doctor is or ought to be considered a sort of pope returned lawrence  i absolve you from all guilt by assuring you that there is urgent need for pursuing the course i suggest  well i will at all events do what i can to help you said emma shall i find her in her own room  yes in bed attended with mrs stoutleys permission by susan quick get rid of the maid before entering on the subject  in a few minutes emma returned to the doctor who still walked up and down in earnest conversation with lewis  she had succeeded she said in persuading nita to let her father be sent for and the place to which he had gone for a few days was saxon in the rhone valley  the counts address had also been obtained but nita had stipulated that the messenger should on no account disturb her father by entering the house but should send for him and wait outside  strange prohibition exclaimed lawrence  however we must send off a messenger without delay  stay said lewis detaining his friend there seems to be delicacy as well as mystery connected with this matter you must therefore allow me to be the messenger  lawrence had no objection to the proposal and in less than an hour lewis guided by antoine grennon was on the road to martigny by way of the celebrated pass of the tetenoire  the guide was one of natures gentlemen  although low in the social scale and trained in a rugged school he possessed that innate refinement of sentiment and feelinga gift of god sometimes transmitted through a gentle motherwhich makes a true gentleman  among men of the upper ranks this refinement of soul may be counterfeited by the superficial polish of manners among those who stand lower in the social scale it cannot be counterfeited at all but still less can it be concealed  as broadcloth can neither make nor mar a true gentleman so fustian cannot hide one  if antoine grennon had been bred at court and arrayed in sumptuous apparel he could not have been more considerate than he was of the feelings and wishes of others or more gentle yet manly in his demeanour  if on an excursion you wished to proceed in a certain direction antoine never suggested that you should go in another unless there were insurmountable difficulties in the way  if you chanced to grow weary you could not have asked antoine to carry your topcoat because he would have observed your condition and anticipated your wishes  if you had been inclined to talk he would have chatted away by the hour on every subject that came within the range of his knowledge and if you had taken him beyond his depth he would have listened by the hour with profound respect obviously pleased and attempting to understand you yet he would not have bored you  he possessed great tact  he would have allowed you to lead the conversation and when you ceased to do so he would have stopped  he never looked sulky or displeased  he never said unkind things though he often said and did kind ones and with all that was as independent in his opinions as the whistling wind among his native glaciers  in fact he was a prince among guides and a preeminently unselfish man  heigho if all the worldyou and i reader includedbore a stronger resemblance to antoine grennon we should have happy times of it  well well dont let us sigh despairingly because of our inability to come up to the mark  it is some comfort that there are not a few such men about us to look up to as exemplars  we know several such both men and women among our own friends  lets be thankful for them  it does us good to think of them  from what we have said the reader will not be surprised to hear that after the first words of morning salutation lewis stoutley walked smartly along the high road leading up the valley of chamouni in perfect silence with antoine trudging like a mute by his side  lewis was too busy with his thoughts to speak at first  nitas illness and the mystery connected somehow with the count afforded food not only for meditation but anxiety and it was not until the town lay far behind them that he looked at his guide and said  the route over the tetenoire is very grand i am told  very grand monsieurmagnificent  you are well acquainted with it doubtless  yes i have passed over it hundreds of times  does monsieur intend to make a divergence to the col de balme  no i have urgent business on hand and must push on to catch the railway  would the divergence you speak of take up much time  is the col de balme worth going out of ones way to see  it is well worthy of a visit said the guide replying to the last query first as you can there have a completely uninterrupted viewone of the very finest views of mont blanc and all its surroundings  the time required for the divergence is little more than two hours with monsieurs walking powers perhaps not so much besides there is plenty of time as we shall reach martigny much too soon for the train  in that case we shall make the detour said lewis  are the roads difficult  no quite easy  it is well that monsieur dispensed with a mule as we shall be more independent and a mule is not so quick in its progress as an active man  while they chatted thus walking at a quick pace up the valley antoine observing that his young charge was now in a conversational frame of mind commented on the magnificent scenery and drew attention to points of interest as they came into view  their route at first lay in the low ground by the banks of the river arve which rushed along wild and muddy as if rejoicing in its escape from the superincumbent glaciers that gave it birth  the great peaks of the mont blanc range hemmed them in on the right the slopes of the brevent on the left  passing the village of argentiere with rapid strides and pausing but a few moments to look at the vast glacier of the same name which pours into the valley the icefloods gendered among the heights around the aiguille verte and the aiguille du chardonnet which rise respectively to a height of above 13400 and 12500 feet they reached the point where the tetenoire route diverged to the left at that time in the form of a mere bridlepath and pushed forward towards the col or pass  on the way antoine pointed out heaps of slabs of black slate  these he said were collected by the peasants who in spring covered their snowclad fields with them the sun heating the slabs caused the snow beneath to melt rapidly and thus by a very simple touch of art they managed to wrest from nature several weeks that would otherwise have been lost  as they rose into the higher grounds heaps and rude pillars of stone were observed  these were the landmarks which guided travellers through that region when it was clad in its wintry robe of deep snow and all paths obliterated  at last they stood on the col de balme  there was a solitary inn there but antoine turned aside from it and led his companion a mile or so to one side to a white stone which marked the boundary between switzerland and france  it is vain to attempt in words a description of scenes of grandeur ink at the best is impotent in such matters even paint fails to give an adequate idea  we can do no more than run over a list of names from this commanding point of view mont blanc is visible in all his majestyvast boundless solemn incomprehensiblewith his aiguilles de tour dargentiere verte du dru de charmoz du midi etcetera around him his white head in the clouds his glacial drapery rolling into the vale of chamouni his rocks and his pineclad slopes toned down by distance into fine shadows  on the other side of the vale rise the steeps of the aiguilles rouges and the brevent  to the north towers the croix de fer and to the northeast is seen the entire chain of the bernese alps rising like a mighty white leviathan with a bristling back of pinnacles  splendid though the view was however lewis did not for a moment forget his mission  allowing himself only a few minutes to drink it in he hastened back to the tetenoire path and soon found himself traversing a widely different scene  on the col he had as it were stood aloof and looked abroad on a vast and glorious region now he was involved in its rocky ridgy woody details  here and there long vistas opened up to view but for the most part his vision was circumscribed by towering cliffs and deep ravines  sometimes he was down in the bottom of mountain valleys at other times walking on ledges so high on the precipicefaces that cottages in the vales below seemed little bigger than sheep  now the country was wooded and soft anon it was barren and rocky but never tame or uninteresting  at one place where the narrow gorge was strewn with huge boulders antoine pointed out a spot where two swiss youths had been overwhelmed by an avalanche  it had come down from the red gorges of the aiguilles rouges at a spot where the vale or pass was comparatively wide perhaps its width had induced the hapless lads to believe themselves quite safe from anything descending on the other side of the valley  if so they were mistaken the dreadful rush of rock and wrack swept the entire plain and buried them in the ruin  towards evening the travellers reached martigny in good time for the train which speedily conveyed them to saxon  this town is the only one in switzerlandthe only one indeed in europe with the exception of monacowhich possesses that great blight on civilisation a public gamblingtable  that the blight is an unusually terrible one may be assumed from the fact that every civilised european nation has found it absolutely necessary to put such places down with a strong hand  at the time lewis stoutley visited the town however it was not so singular in its infamy as it now is  he was ignorant of everything about the place save its name  going straight to the first hotel that presented itself he inquired for the count horetzki  the count he was told did not reside there perhaps he was at the casino  to the casino lewis went at once  it was an elegant swiss building the promenade of which was crowded with visitors  the strains of music fell sweetly on the youths ear as he approached  leaving antoine outside he entered and repeated his inquiries for the count  they did not know the count was the reply but if monsieur would enter the rooms perhaps he might find him  lewis remembering the expressed desire of nita hesitated but as no one seemed inclined to attend to his inquiries beyond a civil reply that nothing was known about the count he entered not a little surprised at the difficulty thrown in his way  the appearance of the salon into which he was ushered at once explained the difficulty and at the same time sent a sudden gleam of light into his mind  crowds of ladies and gentlemensome eager some anxious others flippant or dogged and a good many quite calm and cool surrounded the brilliantlylighted gaming tables  every one seemed to mind only his own business and each mans business may be said to have been the fleecing of his neighbour to the utmost of his powernot by means of skill or wisdom but by means of mere chance and through the medium of professional gamblers and rougeetnoir  with a strange fluttering at his heart for he remembered his own weakness lewis hurried forward and glanced quickly at the players almost the first face he saw was that of the count  but what a changed countenance  instead of the usual placid smile and goodhumoured though sad expression about the eyes there was a terrible look of intense fixed anxiety with deepknotted lines on his brow and a horribly drawn look about the mouth  make your play gentlemen said the presiding genius of the tables as he spun round the board on the action of which so much depended  the count had already laid his stake on the table and clutched his rake with such violence as almost to snap the handle  other players had also placed their stakes some with cool calculating precision a few with nervous uncertainty many with apparent indifference  with the exception of the count and a lady near him however there was little of what might indicate very strong feeling on any countenance  one young and pretty girl after placing her little pile of silver stood awaiting the result with calm indifference possibly assumed  whatever might be the thoughts or feelings of the players there was nothing but businesslike gravity stamped on the countenances of the four men who presided over the revolving board each with neatlyarranged rows of silver fivefranc pieces in front of him and a wooden rake lying ready to hand  each player also had a rake with which he or she pushed the coins staked upon a certain space of the table or on one of the dividing lines which gave at least a varied if not a better chance  the process of play was short and sharp  for a few seconds the board spun the players continuing to place or increase or modify the arrangement of the stakes up to nearly the last moment  as the board revolved more slowly a pea fell into a holered or blackand upon this the fate of each hung  a notable event truly on which untold millions of money have changed hands innumerable lives have been sacrificed and unspeakable misery and crime produced in days gone by  the decision of the peaif we may so express itwas quietly stated and to an ignorant spectator it seemed as if the guardians of the table raked all the stakes into their own maws  but here and there like white rocks in a dark sea several little piles were left untouched  to the owners of these a number of silver pieces were tossedtossed so deftly that we might almost say it rained silver on those regions of the table  no wizard of legerdemain ever equalled the sleight of hand with which these men pitched reckoned manipulated and raked in silver pieces  the counts pile remained untouched and a bright flush suffused his hitherto pale cheeks while the silver rain was falling on his square but to the surprise of lewis he did not rake it towards him as did the others  he left the increased amount on exactly the same spot merely drawing it gently together with his rake  as he did so the knotted haggard look returned to his once again bloodless brow and face  not less precise and silent were his companions  the board again spun round the inexorable pea fell the raking and raining were repeated and again the counts stake lay glittering before him  his eyes glittered even more brightly than the silver  lewis concluded that he must have been brought down to desperate poverty and meant to recover himself by desperate means for he left the whole stake again on the same spot  this time the pea fell into black  the colour was symbolic of the counts feelings for next moment the silver heap was raked from before him along with other heaps as if nothing unusual had happened and in truth nothing had  wholesale ruin and robbery was the daily occupation there  for a few seconds the count gazed at the blank space before him with an expression of stony unbelief then springing suddenly to his feet he spurned his chair from him and rushed from the room  so quick was the movement that he had reached the door and passed out before lewis could stop him  springing after him with a feeling of great alarm the youth dashed across the entrancehall but turned in the wrong direction  being put right by a porter he leaped through the doorway and looked for antoine who he knew must have seen the count pass but antoine was not there  as he quickly questioned one who stood near he thought he saw a man running among the adjacent shrubbery  he could not be sure the night being dark but he promptly ran after him  on dashing round a turn in the gravelwalk he found two men engaged in what appeared to be a deadly struggle  suddenly the place was illumined by a red flash a loud report followed and one of the two fell  ah  monsieur exclaimed antoine as lewis came forward aid me here he is not hurt i think  hurt  do you mean that he tried to shoot himself  he had not time to try but im quite sure that he meant to said antoine so i ran after him and caught his hand  the pistol exploded in the struggle  as the guide spoke the count rose slowly  the starlight was faint but it sufficed to show that the stony look of despair was gone and that the gentle expression natural to him had returned  he was deadly pale and bowed his head as one overwhelmed with shame  oh pardon monsieur exclaimed poor antoine as he thought of the roughness with which he had been compelled to treat him  i did not mean to throw you  you did not throw me friend  i tripped and fell replied the count in a low husky voice  mr stoutley he added turning to lewis by what mischance you came here i know not but i trust that you were not were notpresent  i meando you know the cause of my conductthis  he stopped abruptly  my dear sir said lewis in a low kind voice at the same time grasping the counts hand and leading him aside i was in the rooms i saw you there but believe me when i assure you that no feeling but that of sympathy can touch the heart of one who has been involved in the meshes of the same net  the counts manner changed instantly  he returned the grasp of the young man and looked eagerly in his face as he repeated  has been involved  how then did you escape  im not sure that i have escaped answered lewis sadly  not sure  oh young man make sure  give no rest to your soul till you are quite sure  it is a dreadful netterrible  when once wrapped tightly round one there is no escapeno escape  in this it resembles its sister passionthe love of strong drink  the count spoke with such deep pathos and in tones so utterly hopeless that lewiss ready sympathies were touched and he would have given anything to be able to comfort his friend but never before having been called upon to act as a comforter he felt sorely perplexed  call it not a passion he said  the love of gaming as of drink is a disease and a disease may be curedhas been cured even when desperate  the count shook his head  you speak in ignorance mr stoutley  you know nothing of the struggles i have made  it is impossible  with god all things are possible replied lewis quoting almost to his own surprise a text of scripture  but forgive my delay he added i came here on purpose to look for you  your daughter nita is illnot seriously ill i believe he said on observing the counts startled look but ill enough to warrant your being sent for  i knowi know cried the count with a troubled look as he passed his hand across his brow  i might have expected it  she cannot sustain the misery i have brought on her  oh why was i prevented from freeing her from such a father  is she very ill  did she send for me did she tell you what i am  the excited manner and wild aspect of the gambler more than the words told of a mind almost if not altogether unhinged  observing this with some anxiety lewis tried to soothe him  while leading him to an hotel he explained the nature of nitas attack as well as he could and said that she had not only refrained from saying anything about her father but that she seemed excessively unwilling to reveal the name of the place to which he had gone or to send for him  no one knows anything unfavourable about count horetzki said lewis in a gentle tone save his fellowsinner who now assures him of his sincere regard  as for antoine grennon he is a wise and can be a silent man  no brother could be more tender of the feelings of others than he  come you will consent to be my guest tonight  you are unwell i shall be your amateur physician  my treatment and a night of rest will put you all right and tomorrow by break of day we will hie back to chamouni over the tetenoire    chapter nineteen  mountaineering in general  a week passed away during which nita was confined to bed and the count waited on her with the most tender solicitude  as their meals were sent to their rooms it was not necessary for the latter to appear in the salleamanger or the salon  he kept himself carefully out of sight and intelligence of the invalids progress was carried to their friends by susan quick who was allowed to remain as sicknurse and who rejoiced in filling that office to one so amiable and uncomplaining as nita  of course lewis was almost irresistibly tempted to talk with susan about her charge but he felt the impropriety of such a proceeding and refrained  not so gillie white  that sapient blue spider sitting in his wonted chair resplendent with brass buttons and brazen impudence availed himself of every opportunity to perform an operation which he styled pumping but susan although ready enough to converse freely on things in general was judicious in regard to things particular whatever might have passed in the sickroom the pumping only brought up such facts as that the count was a splendid nurse as well as a loving father and that he and his daughter were tenderly attached to each other  well susan observed gillie with an approving nod im glad to hear wot you say for its my blief that tender attachments is the right sort o thing  ive got one or two myself  indeed said susan who for i wonder  wy for one replied the spider ive had a wery tender attachment to my mother ever since that blessed time wen i was attached to her buzzum in the rampagin hunger of infancy  then ive got another attachmentnot quite so old but wery strong oh uncommon powerfulfor a young lady named susan quick  dyou happen to know her  oh gillie youre a sad boy said susan  well i make a pint never to contradict a ooman believin it to be dangerous returned gillie but i cant say that i feel sad  im raither jolly than otherwise  a summons from the sickroom cut short the conversation  during the week in question it had rained a good deal compelling the visitors at chamouni to pass the time indoors with books billiards draughts and chess  towards the end of the week lewis met the count and discovered that he was absolutely destitute of fundsdid not in fact possess enough to defray the hotel expenses  mother said lewis during a private audience in her bedchamber the same evening i want twenty pounds from you  certainly my boy but why do you come to me  you know that dr lawrence has charge of and manages my money  how i wish there were no such thing as money and no need for it  mrs stoutley finished her remark with her usual languid smile and pathetic sigh but if her physician dr tough had been there he would probably have noted that mountainair had robbed the smile of half its languor and the sigh of nearly all its pathos  there was something like seriousness too in the good ladys eye  she had been impressed more than she chose to admit by the sudden death of le croix whom she had frequently seen and whose stalwart frame and grave countenance she had greatly admired  besides this one or two accidents had occurred since her arrival in the swiss valley for there never passes a season without the occurrence of accidents more or less serious in the alps on one occasion the news had been brought that a young lady recently married whose good looks had been the subject of remark more than once was killed by falling rocks before her husbands eyes  on another occasion the spirits of the tourists were clouded by the report that a guide had fallen into a crevasse and though not killed was much injured  mrs stoutley chanced to meet the rescueparty returning slowly to the village with the poor shattered frame of the fine young fellow on a stretcher  it is one thing to read of such events in the newspapers  it is another and a very different thing to be near or to witness themto be in the actual presence of physical and mental agony antoine grennon too had made a favourable impression on mrs stoutley and when in passing one day his extremely humble cottage she was invited by antoines exceedingly pretty wife to enter and partake of bread and milk largely impregnated with cream which was handed to her by antoines excessively sweet blueeyed daughter the lady who had hitherto spent her life among the bright icepinnacles of society was forced to admit to emma gray that dr tough was right when he said there were some beautiful and precious stones to be found among the moraines of social life  i know that lawrence keeps the purse said lewis but i want your special permission to take this money because i intend to give it away  twenty pounds is a pretty large gift lewis said his mother raising her eyebrows  who is it that has touched the springs of your liberality  not the family of poor le croix  no le croix happily leaves no family  he was an unmarried man  i must not tell you just yet mother  trust me it shall be well bestowed besides i ask it as a loan  it shall be refunded  dont talk of refunding money to your mother foolish boy  go you may have it  lewis kissed his mothers cheek and thanked her  he quickly found the count but experienced considerable difficulty in persuading him to accept the money  however by delicacy of management and by assuming as a matter of course that it was a loan to be repaid when convenient he prevailed  the count made an entry of the loan in his notebook with lewiss london address and they parted with a kindly shake of the hand little imagining that they had seen each other on earth for the last time  on the monday following a superb day opened on the vale of chamouni such a day as through the medium of sight and scent is calculated to gladden the heart of man and beast  that the beasts enjoyed it was manifest from the pleasant sounds that they sent gushing like a hymn of thanksgivingand who shall say it was notinto the bright blue sky  birds carolled on the shrubs and in the air cats ventured abroad with hair erect and backs curved to exchange greetings with each other in wary defiance of dogs kittens sprawled in the sunshine and made frantic efforts to achieve the impossible feat of catching their own shadows varying the pastime with more successful though arduous attempts at their own tails dogs bounded and danced chiefly on their hind legs round their loved companion man including woman juvenile dogs chased tumbled over barked at and gnawed each other with amiable fury wagging their various tails with a vigour that suggested a desire to shake them off tourist men and boys moved about with a decision that indicated the having of particular business on hand tourist women and girls were busily engaged with baskets and botanical boxes or flitted hither and thither in climbing costume with obtrusive alpenstocks as though a general attack on mont blanc and all his satellite aiguilles were meditated  among these were our friends the professor captain wopper emma gray slingsby lewis and lawrence under the guidance of antoine grennon  strange to say they were all a little dull notwithstanding the beauty of the weather and the pleasant anticipation of a day on the hillsnot a hard toilsome day with some awful alpine summit as its aim but what lewis termed a jolly day a picnicky day to be extended into night and to include any place or to be cut short or extended according to whim  the professor was dull because having to leave this was to be his last excursion captain wopper was dull because his cherished matrimonial hopes were being gradually dissipated  he could not perceive that lawrence was falling in love with emma or emma with lawrence  the utmost exertion of sly diplomacy of which he was capable short of straightforward advice had failed to accomplish anything towards the desirable end  emma was dull because her friend nita although recovering was still far from well  slingsby was dull for the same reason and also because he felt his passion to be hopeless  lewis was dull because he knew nitas circumstances to be so very sad and lawrence was dull becausewell we are not quite sure why he was dull  he was rather a selfcontained fellow and couldnt be easily understood  of the whole party antoine alone was not dull  nothing could put him in that condition but seeing that the others were so he was grave quiet attentive  some of the excursionists had left at a much earlier hour  four strapping youths with guides had set out for the summit of mont blanc a mingled party of ladies gentlemen guides and mules were on the point of starting to visit the mer de glace a delicate student unable for long excursions was preparing to visit with his sister the glacier des bossons  others were going or had gone to the source of the arveiron and to the brevent while the british peer having previously been conducted by a new and needlessly difficult path to the top of monte rosa was led off by his persecutor to attempt by an impossible route to scale the matterhornto reach the maintruck as captain wopper put it by going down the sternpost along the keel over the bobstay up the flyin jib across the foretopmaststay and up the maintopgallant halyards  this at least was lewis stoutleys report of the captains remark  we cannot answer for its correctness  but nothing can withstand the sweet influences of fresh mountainair and sunshine  in a short time dull care was put to flight and when our partyemma being on a mulereached the neighbouring heights past and future were largely forgotten in the enjoyment of the present  besides being sunny and bright the day was rather cool so that after dismissing the mule and taking to the glaciers and iceslope the air was found to be eminently suitable for walking  its a bad lookout murmured captain wopper when he observed that dr lawrence turned deliberately to converse with the professor leaving lewis to assist emma to alight even although he the captain had by means of laboured contrivance and vast sagacity brought the doctor and the mule into close juxtaposition at the right time  however the captains temperament was sanguine  he soon forgot his troubles in observing the curious position assumed by slingsby on the first steep slope of rocky ground they had to descend for descents as well as ascents were frequent at first  the artist walked on allfours but with his back to the hill instead of his face his feet thus being in advance  what sort of an outsidein fashion is that slingsby asked the captain when they had reached the bottom  its a way i have of relieving my knees said slingsby try it  thank ee no returned the captain  it dont suit my pecooliar build it would throw too much of my weight amidships  youve no idea said slingsby what a comfort it is to a man whose knees suffer in descending  id rather go up twenty mountains than descend one  this plan answers only on steep places and is but a temporary relief  still that is something at the end of a long day  the artist exemplified his plan at the next slope  the captain tried it but as he expressed it broke in two at the waist and rolled down the slope to the unspeakable delight of his friends  i fear you will find this rather severe said the professor to emma during a pause in a steep ascent  oh no i am remarkably strong replied emma smiling  i was in switzerland two years ago and am quite accustomed to mountaineering  yes remarked lawrence and miss gray on that occasion i am told ascended to the top of the dent du midi which you know is between ten and eleven thousand feet high and she also during the same season walked from champery to sixt which is a good days journey so we need have no anxiety on her account  although the doctor smiled as he spoke he also glanced at emma with a look of admiration  captain wopper noted the glance and was comforted at luncheon however the doctor seated himself so that the professors bulky person came between him and emma  the captain noted that also and was depressed  what between elation and depression mingled with fatigue and victuals the captain ultimately became recklessly jovial  what are yonder curious things asked emma pointing to so me gigantic objects which looked at a distance like rude pillars carved by man  these said the professor are natures handiwork  you will observe that on each pillar rests a rugged capital  the capital is the cause of the pillar  it is a hard rock which originally rested on a softer bed of friable stone  the weather has worn away the soft bed except where it has been protected by the hard stone and thus a natural pillar has arisenjust like the icepillars which are protected from the sun in the same way only the latter are more evanescent  further on the professor drew the attention of his friends to the beautiful blue colour of the holes which their alpenstocks made in the snow  once said he while walking on the heights of monte rosa i observed this effect with great interest and while engaged in the investigation of the cause got a surprise which was not altogether agreeable  some of the paths there are on very narrow ridges and the snow on these ridges often overhangs them  i chanced to be walking in advance of my guide at the time to which i refer and amused myself as i went along by driving my alpenstock deep into the snow when suddenly to my amazement i sent the end of the staff right through the snow and on withdrawing it looked down into space  i had actually walked over the ridge altogether and was standing above an abyss some thousands of feet deep  horrible exclaimed emma  you jumped off pretty quickly i dare say  nay i walked off with extreme caution but i confess to having felt a sort of cold shudder with which my frame had not been acquainted previously  while they were thus conversing a cloud passed overhead and sent down a slight shower of snow  to most of the party this was a matter of indifference but the man of science soon changed their feelings by drawing attention to the form of the flakes  he carried a magnifying glass with him which enabled him to show their wonders more distinctly it was like a shower of frozen flowers of the most delicate and exquisite kind  each flake was a flower with six leaves  some of the leaves threw out lateral spines or points like ferns some were rounded others arrowy reticulated and serrated but although varied in many respects there was no variation in the number of leaves  what amazin beauty in a snowflake exclaimed the captain many a one ive seen without knowin how splendid it was  the works of god are indeed wonderful said the professor but they must be sought outexamined with careto be fully understood and appreciated  yet there are certain philosophers observed lewis who hold that the evidence of design here and elsewhere does not at all prove the existence of god  they say that the crystals of these snowflakes are drawn together and arrange themselves by means of natural forces  they say truly replied the professor but they seem to me to stop short in their reasoning  they appear to ignore the fact that this elemental original force of which they speak must have had a creator however far they may go back into mysterious and incomprehensible elements which they choose to call blind forces they do not escape the fact that matter cannot have created itself that behind their utmost conceptions there must still be one noncreated eternal living being who created all who upholds all and whom we call god  descending again from the heights in order to cross a valley and gain the opposite mountain our ramblers quitted the glacier and about noon found themselves close to a lovely pineclad knoll the shaded slopes of which commanded an unusually fine view of rocky cliff and fringing wood with a background of glacier and snowflecked pinnacles  halting accidentally in a row before this spot they looked at it with interest  suddenly the professor stepped in front of the others and pointing to the knoll said with twinkling eyes  what does it suggest  come dux to slingsby who happened to stand at the head of the line tell me sir what does it suggest  i know sir exclaimed the captain who stood at the dunces extremity of the line holding out his fist with true schoolboy eagerness  it suggests said the artist rolling his eyes a thing of beauty and  next interrupted the professor pointing to lawrence  i know sir shouted the captain  hold your tongue sir  ay ay sir  it is suggestive said lawrence of an oasis in the desert  very poor sir said the professor severely  next  it suggests a cool shade on a hot day said emma  better but not right  next  please sir id rather not answer said lewis putting his forefinger in his mouth  you must sir  i know sir interrupted captain wopper shaking his fist eagerly  silence you boobywell boy what does it suggest to you  please sir answered lewis it suggests the mole on your professorial cheek  sir cried the professor sternly remind me to give you a severe caning tonight  yes sir  well booby what have you got to say to it  wittles shouted the captain  right cried the professor only it would have been better expressed had you saidluncheon  go up sir put yourself at the head of the class and lead it to a scene of glorious festivity  thus instructed the captain put himself at the head of the line  now then captain said lewis lets have a trueblue nautical word of commandhoist yer main topsl skyscrapers abaft the cleat o the spanker boom heave the main deck overboard and let go the painteror something o that sort  hold on to the painter you mean said slingsby  youre both wrong cried the captain my orders are those of the immortal nelsonclose action my ladsengland expects every man to hooray  with a wild cheer and waving his hat the seaman rushed up the side of the knoll followed by his obedient and willing crew  in order to render the feast more complete several members of the party had brought small private supplies to supplement the cold mutton ham bread and light claret which antoine and two porters had carried in their knapsacks  captain wopper had brought a supply of variously coloured abominations known in england by the name of comfits in scotland as sweeties  these mixed with snow and water he styled icedlemonade  emma tried the mixture and declared it excellent which caused someone to remark that the expression of her face contradicted her tongue  lewis produced a small flask full of a rich dark portwiney liquid which he said he had brought because it had formerly been one of the most delightful beverages of his childish years  it was tasted with interest and rejected with horror being liquorice water  emma produced a bottle of milk in the consumption of which she was ably assisted by the professor who declared that his natural spirits required no artificial stimulants  the professor himself had not been forgetful of the general good  he had brought with him a complex copper implement which his friends had supposed was a new species of theodolite but which turned out to be a scientific coffeepot in the development of which and its purposes as the man of science carefully explained there was called into play some of the principles involved in the sciences of hydraulics and pneumatics to which list lewis added in an undertone those of aquatics ecstatics and rheumatics  the machine was perfect but the professors natural turn for practical mechanics not being equal to his knowledge of other branches of science he failed properly to adjust a screw  this resulted in an explosion of the pot which blew its lid as lewis expressed it into the north of italy and its contents into the fire a second effort using the remains of the scientific pot as an ordinary kettle was more successful  you see my friends said the professor apologetically it is one of the prerogatives of science that her progress cannot be hindered  her resources and appliances are inexhaustible  when one style of experiment fails we turn at once to another and obtain our result as i now prove to you by handing this cup of coffee to miss gray  you had better not sweeten it mademoiselle  it is quite unnecessary to make the very trite observation that in your case no sugar is required  yes the progress of science is slow but it is sure  everything must fall before it in time  ah just soone down another come onthats your motto aint it said captain wopper who invariably during the meal delivered his remarks from a cavern filled with a compound of mutton bread and ham but i say professor are you spliced  spliced echoed the man of science  ay married i mean  yes i am wed he replied with enthusiasm  i have a beautiful wife in russia and she is good as beautiful  in roosiaeh  well its a longish way off but id advise you as a friend not to let her know that you pay such wallopin compliments to young english ladies  it might disagree with her dye see  at this point the conversation and festivities were interrupted by slingsby who having gone off to sketch had seated himself on a mound within sight of his friends in a position so doubled up and ridiculous as to call forth the remark from lawrence that few traits of character were more admirable and interesting than those which illustrated the utter disregard of personal appearance in true and enthusiastic devotees of art  to which captain wopper added that he was a rum lot an no mistake  the devotee was seen by the revellers to start once or twice and clap his hands to various pockets as though he had forgotten his indiarubber or penknife  then he was observed to drop his sketchingbook and hastily slap all his pockets as if he had forgotten fifty pieces of indiarubber and innumerable penknives  finally he sprang up and slapped himself all over wildly yelling at the same time as if he had been a maniac  he had inadvertently selected an anthill as his seat that was all but that was sufficient to check his devotion to art and necessitate his retirement to a rocky defile where he devoted himself to the study of the nude in his own person and whence he returned looking imbecile and hot  such contretemps however do not materially affect the health or spirits of the young and strong  ere long slingsby was following his companions with his wonted enthusiasm and devoteelike admiration of nature in all her varying aspects  his enthusiasm was however diverted from the study of vegetable and mineral if we may so put it to that of animal nature for one of the porters who had a tendency to go poking his staff into holes and crannies of the rocks suddenly touched a marmot  he dropped his pack and began at once to dig up earth and stones as fast as possible assisted by his comrades but the little creature was too sagacious for them  they came to its bed at last and found that while they had been busy at one end of the hole the marmot had quietly walked out at the other and made off  having pushed over the valley and once more ascended to the regions of perpetual ice the ramblers determined to attackas the phrase goes among alpine climbersa neighbouring summit  it was not a very high one and emma declared that she was not only quite able but very anxious to attempt it  the attempt was therefore made and after a couple of hours of pretty laborious work accomplished  they found themselves on a pinnacle which overlooked a large portion of the iceworld around mont blanc  while standing there one or two avalanches were observed and the professor pointed out that avalanches were not all of one character  some he said were composed of rock mud and water others entirely of ice many of them were composed of these elements mixed and others were entirely of snow  true monsieur observed the guide and the last kind is sometimes very fatal  there was one from which my wife and child had a narrow escape  they were visiting at the time a near relation who dwelt in a village in a valley not far distant from this spot  behind the village there is a steep slope covered with pines behind that the mountain rises still more steeply  the little forest stands between that village and destruction  but for it avalanches would soon sweep the village away but wood is not always a sure protector  sometimes when frost renders the snow crisp and dry the trees fail to check its descent  it was so on the last night of my wifes visit  a brother was about to set off with her from the door of our relatives house when the snow began to descend through the trees like water  it was like dry flour  there was not much noise merely a hissing sound but it came down in a deluge filled all the houses and suffocated nearly all the people in them  my brotherinlaw saw it in time  he put his horse to full speed and brought my dear wife and child away in safety but his own father mother and sister were lost  we tried to reach their house the next day but could advance through the soft snow only by taking two planks with us and placing one before the other as we went along  soon after the ramblers had begun their return journey they came to a slope which they thought might be descended by sliding or glissading it was the first time that emma had seen such work and she felt much inclined to try it but was dissuaded by antoine who led her round by an easier way  at the foot of the slope they came to a couloir or sloping gorge so steep that snow could not lie on it  its surface was therefore hard ice  although passable antoine deemed it prudent not to cross the more so that he observed some ominous obelisks of ice impending at the top of the slope  why not cross and let emma see how we manage by cutting steps in the ice said lewis  he received a conclusive though unexpected answer from one of the obelisks abovementioned which fell at the moment broke into fragments and swept the couloir from top to bottom with incredible violence  it is wonderful what a deal of experience is required to make foolish people wise  winthin the next ten minutes this warning was forgotten and lewis led his cousin into a danger which almost cost the lives of three of the party    chapter twenty  records a serious event  our ramblers had now reached a place where a great expanse of rock surface was exposed and the temptation to dilate on the action of glaciers proved too strong for the professor  he therefore led those who were willing to follow to a suitable spot and pointed out the striations flutings and polishings of the granite which showed that in former ages the glacier had passed there although at that time it was far below in the valley  the polishings he said were caused by the ice slowly grinding over the surface of the rock and the flutings and groovings were caused not by the ice itself but by stones which were embedded in its under surface and which cut the solid granite as if with chisels  meanwhile lewis and emma having taken the opportunity to search for plants had wandered on a little in advance and had come to another steep slope which was however covered with snow at its upper part below where it became steeper there was no snow only pure ice which extended downwards to an immense distance broken only here and there by a few rocks that cropped through its surface  it terminated in a rocky gorge which was strewn thickly with debris from above  let us cross this said emma with a look of glee for she possessed an adventurous spirit  wed better not answered lewis  the slope is very steep  true o cautious cousin retorted emma with a laugh but it is covered here with snow that is soft and probably kneedeep  go on it sir and try  thus commanded lewis obeyed and found that the snow was indeed kneedeep and that there was no possibility of their either slipping or falling unless one were unusually careless and even in that case the soft snow would have checked anything like an involuntary glissade  let me go first said lewis  nay i will go first returned emma you will follow and pick me up if i should fall  so saying she stepped lightly into the snow and advanced while her companion stood looking at her with a halfamused halfanxious smile  she had not made six steps and lewis was on the point of following when he observed that there was a crack across the snow just above where he stood and the whole mass began to slide  for a moment he was transfixed with horror  the next he had sprung to his cousins side and seized her arm shouting  emma  emma come back  quick  it moves  but poor emma could not obey  she would as soon have expected the mountain itself to give way as the huge mass of snow on which she stood  at first its motion was slow and lewis struggled wildly to extricate her but in vain for the snow avalanche gathered speed as it advanced and in its motion not only sank them to their waists but turned them helplessly round thus placing lewis farthest from the firm land  he shouted now with all the power of his lungs for help while emma screamed from terror  lawrence chanced to be nearest to them  he saw at a glance what had occurred and dashed down the hillside at headlong speed  a wave was driving in front of the couple who were now embedded nearly to their armpits while streams of snow were hissing all round them and the mass was beginning to rush  one look sufficed to show lawrence that rescue from the side was impossible but with that swift power of perception which is aroused in some natures by the urgent call to act he observed that some yards lower downnear the place where the iceslope began there was a rock near to the side in the track of the avalanche which it divided  leaping down to this he sprang into the sliding flood a little above it and with a powerful effort caught the rock and drew himself upon it  next moment emma was borne past out of reach of his hand  lawrence rushed deep into the snow and held out his alpenstock emma caught it  he felt himself turned irresistibly round and a sick feeling of despair chilled his lifeblood  at the same moment a powerful hand grasped his collar  hold on monsieur cried antoine in a deep yet encouraging voice ive got you safe  as he spoke emma shrieked i cannot hold on  no wonder  she had not only to resist the rushing snow but to sustain the drag of lewis who as we have said had been carried beyond his cousin and whose only chance now lay in his retaining hold of her arm ere the words had quite left her lips lewis was seen deliberately to let go his hold and throw up his armit seemed as if waving it  next moment emma was dragged on the rock where she and her companions stood gazing in horror as their companion was swept upon the iceslope and carried down headlong  the snow was by this time whirled onward in a sort of mist or spray in the midst of which lewis was seen to strike a rock with his shoulder and swing violently round while parts of his clothing were plainly rent from his body but the painful sight did not last long  a few seconds more and he was hurled apparently a lifeless form among the debris and rocks far below  death in such a case might have been expected to be instantaneous but the very element that caused the poor youths fall helped to save him during the struggle for life while clinging to emmas arm the check brief though it was sufficed to allow most of the snow to pass down before him so that he finally fell on a comparatively soft bed but it was clear that he had been terribly injured and what made matters worse he had fallen into a deep gorge surrounded by precipices which seemed to some of the party to render it quite impossible to reach him  what is to be done exclaimed lawrence with intense anxiety  he must be got at immediately  delay of treatment in his case even for a short time may prove fatal  i know it monsieur said antoine who had been quietly but quickly uncoiling his rope  one of the porters and i will descend by the precipices  they are too steep for any but wellaccustomed hands and feet  you monsieur understand pretty well the use of the axe and rope  cut your way down the iceslope with jacques  he is a steady man and may be trusted  run rollo to the third porter and fetch aid from gaspards chalet  it is the nearest  i need not say make haste  these orders were delivered in a low rapid voice  the men proceeded at once to obey them  at the same time antoine and his comrade swung themselves down the cliffs and were instantly lost to view  the young porter whom he had named rollo was already going down the mountain at a smart run and jacques was on the iceslope wielding his axe with ceaseless energy and effect while lawrence held the rope to which he was attached and descended the rude and giddy staircase behind him  it was a terrible time for those who were left above in a state of inaction and deep anxiety but there was no help for it  they had to content themselves with watching the rescue and praying for success  it was not long before the guide and porter reached the spot where poor lewis lay  he was not insensible but a deadly pallor overspread his scarred face and the position in which he lay betokened utter helplessness  he could scarcely speak but whispered that he fancied he was not so much hurt as might have been expected and expressed wonder at their having been so long in reaching him  the guide spoke to him with the tenderness of a woman  he knew well how severely the poor youth was injured and handled him very delicately while making such preliminary arrangements as were in his power  a few drops of brandy and water were administered the poor limbs were arranged in a position of greater comfort and the torn rags of clothing wrapped round him  soon they were joined by lawrence who merely whispered a few kind words and proceeded at once to examine him  his chief anxiety was as to the amount of skin that had been destroyed  the examination revealed a terrible and bloody spectacle over which we will draw a veil yet there was reason to believe that the amount of skin torn off and abraded was not sufficient to cause death  lawrence was comforted also by finding that no bones appeared to have been broken  nothing could be done in the way of attempting a removal until the return of rollo with a litter  fortunately this was not long of being brought for the young porter was active and willing and gaspard had promptly accompanied him with men and materials for the rescue  but it was a sad slow and painful process to bear the poor youths frame from that savage gorge and convey him on a litter carried by four men over glaciers and down rugged mountain sides even although done by tender hearts and strong hands  everything that ingenuity could contrive was done to relieve the sufferer and when at last after weary hours they reached the highroad of the valley a carriage was found waiting  a messenger had been sent in advance to fetch it and mrs stoutley was in it  there was something quite touching in the quiet firm air of selfrestraint with which she met the procession and afterwards tended her poor boy it was so unlike her old character  the sun was setting in a field of golden glory when they carried lewis into the hotel at chamouni and laid him on his beda mere wreck of his former self    chapter twenty one  down in the moraine at last  as the reader may suppose the terrible accident to lewis stoutley put an end to further merrymaking among our friends at chamouni  mrs stoutley would have left for england at once if that had been possible but lewis could not be moved for several weeks  at first indeed fears were entertained for his life but his constitution being good and not having been damaged by dissipation he rallied sooner than might have been expected although it was evident from the beginning that complete restoration could not be looked for until many months perhaps years had passed away  we need scarcely say that the rapid improvement of his health was largely due to the tender watchful care of his mother  since visiting switzerland that excellent ladys spirit had undergone a considerable change  without going minutely into particulars we may say that the startling events which had occurred had been made the means of opening her spiritual eyes  it had occurred to hershe scarce knew how or whythat her creator had a claim on her for more consideration than she had been in the habit heretofore of testifying by a few formalities on sundays that there must be some higher end and aim in life than the mere obtaining and maintaining of health and the pursuit of pleasure and that as there was a saviour whom she professed on sundays to follow there must be something real from which she had to be saved as well as something real that had to be done  sin she knew of course was the evil from which everybody had to be saved but being a goodnatured and easygoing woman she really did not feel much troubled by sin  little weaknesses she had no doubt but not half so many as other people she knew of  as to anything seriously worthy the name of sin she did not believe she had any at all  it had never until now occurred to her that the treating of her best friend during a lifetime with cool and systematic indifference or with mere protestations on sundays of adoration was probably as great a sin as she could commit  her thoughts on these points she did not at first mention to any one but she received great help and enlightenment as well as comfort from the quiet sensible talk of dr lawrence as he sat day after day and hour after hour at the bedside of his friend endeavouring to cheer his spirits as well as to relieve his physical painfor lawrence was well fitted to do both  he was not by any means what is styled a sermoniser  he made no apparent effort to turn conversation into religious channels  indeed we believe that when men talk with the unrestrained freedom of true friendship conversation needs no directing  it will naturally flow along all channels and into all the zigzags and crevices of human thoughtreligion included  lewis was in great pain and serious danger lawrence was a man full of the holy spirit and love to jesus  out of the fullness of his heart his mouth spoke when his friend appeared to desire such converse but he never bored him with any subjectfor it is possible to be a profane as well as a religious bore  as soon as lewis could turn his mind to anything after his being brought back to the hotel he asked earnestly after nita horetzki  she has left said mrs stoutley  left  dyou mean gone from chamouni mother exclaimed lewis with a start and a look of anxiety which he did not care to conceal  yes they went yesterday  nita had recovered sufficiently to travel and the medical man who has been attending her urged her removal without delay  she and her father seemed both very sorry to leave us and left kind messages for you  the count wanted much to see you but we would not allow it  kind messages for me repeated lewis in a tone of bitterness what sort of messages  well really i cannot exactly remember returned mrs stoutley with a slight smile the kind of messages that amiable people might be expected to leave in the circumstances you knowregret that they should have to leave us in such a sad condition and sincere hope that you might soon recover etcetera  yes by the way nita also just at parting expressed a hopean earnest hopethat we might meet again poor dear thing she is an extremely affectionate girl and quite broke down when saying goodbye  dyou know where they have gone to mother  no  they mean to move about from place to place i believe  nita said nothing about writing to you did she  did they leave any addressa poste restanteanywhere or any clew whatever as to their whereabouts  none whatever  so then during the weary days of suffering that he knew full well lay before him poor lewis had no consolatory thought in regard to nita save in her expressed earnest hope that they might meet again  it was not much but it was better than nothing  being an ingenious as well as daring architect lewis built amazing structures on that slight foundationstructures which charmed his mental eyes to look upon and which we verily believe tended to facilitate his recoveryso potent is the power of true love  captain wopper said mrs stoutley one morning towards the end of their stay in switzerland lewis having been pronounced sufficiently restored to travel homeward by easy stages i have sent for you to ask you to do me a favourto give me your adviceyour  here to the captains amazement not to say consternation mrs stoutleys voice trembled and she burst into tears  if she had suddenly caught him by the nose pulled his rugged face down and kissed it he could not have been more taken aback  my dear madam he stammered sitting down inadvertently on mrs stoutleys bonnetfor it was to the good ladys private dressingroom that he had been summoned by gillie whitehold on dont now please what ever have i done to  youve done nothing my dear captain said mrs stoutley endeavouring to check her tears  there im very foolish but i cant help it indeed i cant  in proof of the truth of this assertion she broke down again and the captain moving uneasily on his chair ground the bonnet almost to powderit was a straw one  you have been a kind friend captain wopper said mrs stoutley drying her eyes a very kind friend  im glad you think so maam ive meant to beanyhow  you have you have cried mrs stoutley earnestly as she looked through her tears into the seamans rugged countenance and that is my reason for venturing to ask you now to trouble yourself withwith  there was an alarming symptom here of a recurrence of squally weather which caused the captain to give the bonnet an extra turn but she recovered herself and went on  with my affairs  i would not have thought of troubling you but with poor lewie so ill and dr lawrence being so young and probably inexperienced in the ways of life and emma so innocent and helpless andin short imheethat is to sayho dear  i am so silly but i cantindeed i canthoooo  it blew a regular gale now and a very rain of straw debris fell through the canebottomed chair on which the captain sat as he vainly essayed to sooth his friend by earnest pathetic and even tender adjurations to clap a stopper upon that to hold hard to belay to shut down the deadlights of her peepers and suchlike expressive phrases  at length amid many sobs the poor lady revealed the overwhelming fact that she was a beggar that she had actually come down to her last franc that her man of business had flatly declined to advance her another sovereign informing her that the gorong mine had declared no dividend that the wreck of her shattered fortune had been swallowed up by the expenses of their illadvised trip to switzerland and that she had not even funds enough to pay their travelling expenses home in short that she was a miserable boulder at the lowest level of the terminal moraine  to all this captain wopper listened in perfect silence with a blank expression on his face that revealed nothing of the state of feeling within  oh  captain wopper exclaimed the poor lady anxiously surely surely you wont forsake me  i know that i have no claim on you beyond friendship but you have always given us to understand that you were well off and i merely wish to borrow a small sum  just enough and no more  perhaps i may not be able to repay you just immediately but i hope soon and even if it came to the worst there is the furniture in euston square and the carriage and horses  poor mrs stoutley  she was not aware that her man of business had already had these resources appraised and that they no more belonged to her at that moment than if they had been part of the personal estate of the celebrated man in the moon  still the captain gazed at her in stolid silence  even my personal wardrobe proceeded mrs stoutley beginning again to weep i will gladly dis  avast  madam cried the captain suddenly thrusting his right hand into his breechespocket and endeavouring to drag something therefrom with a series of wrenches that would have been terribly trying to the bonnet had its ruin not been already complete dont talk to me of repayment  aint i youryourhusbands brothers buzzum friend willums old chum an messmate  see here  he jerked the chair without rising close to a table which stood at his elbow and placed thereon a large canvas bag much soiled and tied round the neck with a piece of ropeyarn which smelt of tar even at a distance  this was the captains purse  he carried it always in his right trouserpocket and it contained his gold  as for such trifling metal as silver he carried that loose mixed with coppers bits of tobacco broken pipes and a claspknife in the other pocket  he was very fond of his purse  in california he had been wont to carry nuggets in it that simple species of exchange being the chief currency of the country at the time he was there  some of the californian debris had stuck to it when he had filled it at a place of exchange in london with napoleons  emptying its glittering contents upon the table he spread it out  there madam he said with a hearty smile youre welcome to all ive got about me just at this moment and you shall have more when thats done  dont say not so much cause it aint much fifty pound more or less barrin the nuggets which ill keep as i dessay they would only worry you and theres plenty more shot in the locker where that come

indeed no william stout has always been so kind to uskinder than i have deserved  well then ill write to willum  ill say to him willum my boy heres your brothers widdy bin caught in a squall had her

anything short o ten thousand more or less  do yer wust yours to command  willum  there was no resisting such arguments  mrs stoutley smiled through her tears as she accepted the money  captain wopper rose crammed the empty canvas bag into his pocket and hastily retired with portions of the bonnet attached to him  susan said mrs stoutley on the maid answering her summons we shall start for london tomorrow or the day after so pray set about packing up without delay  very well maam replied susan whose eyes were riveted with an expression of surprised curiosity on the canebottomed chair  it is my bonnet susan said the lady looking in the same direction with a sad smile  captain wopper sat down on it by mistake  you had better remove it  to remove it was a feat which even susan with all her ready wit and neatness of hand could not have accomplished without the aid of brush and shovel  she therefore carried it off chair and all to the regions below where she and gillie went into convulsions over it  oh  susan exclaimed the blue spider wot would i not have given to have seed him adoin of it  only think  the ribbons flowers and straw in one uniwarsal mush  wot a grindin there must ave bin  i heerd the purfesser the other day talkin of wot he calls glacierhactionhow they flutes the rocks an grinds in a most musical way over the boulders with crushin wiolence but wots glacier haction to that  susan admitted that it was nothing and they both returned at intervals in the packing during the remainder of that day to have another look at the bonnetdebris and enjoy a fresh explosion over it    chapter twenty two  mysterious proceedings of the captain and gillie  we are back again in londonin mrs robys little cabin at the top of the old tenement in grubbs court  captain wopper is there of course  so is mrs roby  gillie white is there also and susan quick  the captain is at home  the two latter are on a visita social teaparty  little netta white having deposited baby white in the mud at the lowest corner of the court for greater security is waiting upon thema temporary handmaiden relieving by means of variety the cares of permanent nursehood  mrs white is up to the elbows in soapsuds taking at least ocular and vocal charge of the babe in the mud and her husband isdrunk as usual nothere is a change there  good of some kind has been somewhere at work  either knowingly or unwittingly some one has been overcoming evil with good for mrs whites husband is down at the docks toiling hard to earn a few pence wherewith to increase the family funds  and who can tell what a terrible yet hopeful war is going on within that careworn sinworn man  to toil hard with shattered health is burden enough  what must it be when along with the outward toil there is a constant fight with a raging watchful devil within  but the man has given that devil some desperate falls of late  oh how often and how long he has fought with him and been overcome cast down and his armoury of resolutions scattered to the winds  but he has been to see some one or some one has been to see him who has advised him to try another kind of armournot his own  he knows the power of a new affection now  despair was his portion not long ago  he is now animated by hope for the long uncaredfor name of jesus is now growing sweet to his ear  but the change has taken place recently and he looks very weary as he toils and fights  well mother said captain wopper now that ive given you a full true an partikler account of switzerland what dee think of it  it is a strange placevery but i dont approve of people risking their lives and breaking their limbs for the mere pleasure of getting to the top of a mountain of ice  but we cant do anything in life without riskin our lives an breakin our limbs more or less said the captain  an think o the interests of science said gillie quoting the professor  mrs roby shook her tall cap and remained unconvinced  to have expected the old nurse to take an enlightened view on that point would have been as unreasonable as to have looked for just views in gillie white on the subject of conic sections  why mother a man may break a leg or an arm in going down stairs said the captain pursuing the subject by the way that reminds me to ask for fred leven  didnt i hear that he broke his arm coming up his own stair  is it true  true enough replied mrs roby  was he the worse of liquor at the time  no  it was dark and he was carrying a heavy box of something or other for his mother  fred is a reformed man  i think the sight of your poor father gillie has had something to do with it and that night when his mother nearly died  at all events he never touches drink now and he has got a good situation in one of the warehouses at the docks  thats well returned the captain with satisfaction  i had hopes of that young feller from the night you mention  now mother im off gillie and i have some business to transact up the water  very particular businesseh lad  oh wery partickler said gillie responding to his patrons glance with a powerful wink  expressing a hope that susan would keep mrs roby company till he returned the captain left the room with his usual heavy roll and the spider followed with imitative swagger  captain wopper was fond of mystery  although he had to some extent made a confidant of the boy for whom he had taken so strong a fancy he nevertheless usually maintained a dignified distance of demeanour towards him and a certain amount of reticence which as a stern disciplinarian he deemed to be essential  this however did not prevent him from indulging in occasional not to say frequent unbendings of disposition which he condescended to exhibit by way of encouragement to his small protege but these unbendings and confidences were always more or less shrouded in mystery  many of them indeed consisted of nothing more intelligible than nods grins and winks  thatll be rather a nice cottage when its launched said the captain pointing to a building in process of erection which stood so close to the edge of the thames that its being launched seemed as much a literal allusion as a metaphor  raither bobbish assented the spider  clean run fore and aft with bluff bows like a good seaboat said the captain  come lets have a look at it  asking permission to enter of a workman who granted the same with what appeared to gillie an unnecessarily broad grin the captain led the way up a spiral staircase  it bore such a strong resemblance to the familiar one of grubbs court that gillies eyes enlarged with surprise and he looked involuntarily back for his soapy mother and the babe in the mud  there were however strong points of dissimilarity inasmuch as there was no mud or filth of any kind near the new building except lime and the stair instead of leading like that of the tower of babel an interminable distance upwards ended abruptly at the second floor here however there was a passage exactly similar to the passage leading to mrs robys cabin save that it was well lighted and at the end thereof was an almost exact counterpart of the cabin itself  there was the same low roof the same little fireplace with the space above for ornaments and the same couple of little windows looking out upon a stretch of the noble river from which you might have fished  there was the same colour of paint on the walls which had been so managed as to represent the dinginess of antiquity  there was also to all appearance mrs robys own identical bed with its chintz curtains here however resemblance ended for there was none of the grubbs court dirt  the craft on the river were not so large or numerous the reach being above the bridges  if you had fished you not have hooked rats or dead cats and if you had put your head out and looked round you would have encountered altogether a clean airy and respectable neighbourhood populous enough to be quite cheery with occasional gardens instead of mudbanks and without interminable rows of tall chimneypots excluding the light of heaven  gillie not yet having been quite cured of his objectionable qualities at once apostrophised his eye and elizabeth martin  as like as two peas barrin the dirt  the captain evidently enjoyed the lads astonishment  a shipshape sort o craft aint it  it wouldnt be a bad joke to buy iteh  gillie who was rather perplexed but too much a man of the world to disclose much of his state of mind said that it wouldnt be a bad move for any feller who had got the blunt  how much would it cost now  a thousand pounds more or less said the captain with discreet allowance for latitude  ha a goodish lump no doubt  ive half a mind to buy it continued the captain looking round with a satisfied smile  it would be an amoosin sort o thing now to bring old mrs roby here  the air would be fresher for her old lungs wouldnt it  gillie nodded but was otherwise reticent  the stair too wouldnt be too high to get her down now and again and a boat could be handy to shove her into without much exertion  for the matter of that said the captain looking out we might have a slide made like a swiss couloir you know and she could glissade comfortably into the boat out o the winder  then theres a beam to hang her ship an chinee lanterns from an a place over the fireplace to stick her knickknacks  what dee think my lad  gillie who had begun to allow a ray of light to enter his mind gave as his answer an emphatic nod and a broad grin  the captain replied with a nod and a wink whereupon the other retired behind his patron for the purpose of giving himself a quiet hug of delight in which act however he was caught the captain being one who always according to his own showing kept his weathereye open  wy whats the matter with you boy  pains in the stummick is aggrawatin sometimes answered gillie  you havent got em have you  well i cant exactly go for to say as i has answered gillie with another grin  now look ee here youngster said the captain suddenly seizing the spider by his collar and trousers and swinging him as though about to hurl him through the window into the river if you go an let your tongue wag in regard to this matter out you go right through the portholedee see  he set the spider quietly on his legs again who replied with unruffled coolness  mums the word cappen  gillie had been shorn of his blue tights and brass buttons poor mrs stoutley having found it absolutely necessary on her return home to dismiss all her servants dispose of all her belongings and retire into the privacy of a poor lodging in a back street  thus the spider had come to be suddenly thrown on the world again but captain wopper had retained him he said as a mixture of errandboy cabinboy and powdermonkey in which capacity he dwelt with his mother during the night and revolved like a satellite round the captain during the day  a suit of much more appropriate pepperandsalt had replaced the blue tights and buttons  altogether his toutensemble was what the captain styled more shipshape  we have said that mrs stoutley and her family had made a descent in life  as poor lewis remarked with a sad smile they had quitted the gay and glittering heights and gone like a magnificent avalanche down into the moraine  social not less than physical avalanches multiply their parts and widen their course during descent  the stoutleys did not fall alone  a greengrocer a shoemaker and a baker who had long been trembling like human boulders on the precipice of bankruptcy went tumbling down along with them and found rest in a lower part of the moraine than they had previously occupied  its a sad business said lewis to dr lawrence one morning and if you continue to attend me you must do so without the most distant prospect of a fee  my dear fellow returned lawrence have you no such thing as gratitude in your composition  not much and if i had ever so much it would be poor pay  poor indeed if regarded as ones only source of livelihood rejoined lawrence but it is ample remuneration from a friend whether rich or poor and happily capable of being mixed with pounds shillings and pence without deterioration  in the present case i shall be more than rejoiced to take the fee unmixed but whether feed or not feed i insist on continuing attendance on a case which i have a right to consider peculiarly my own  it would have been a bad case indeed but for you returned lewis a flush for a moment suffusing his pale cheek as he took his friends hand and squeezed it  i am thoroughly convinced lawrence that gods blessing on your skill and unwearied care of me at the time of the accident is the cause of my being alive to thank you today  but sit down my dear fellow and pray postpone your professional inquiries for a little as i have something on my mind which i wish to ask you about  lawrence shook his head  business first pleasure afterwards he said professional duties must not be postponed  now said lewis when he had finished are you satisfied  do you admit that even an unprofessional man might have seen at a glance that i am much better and that your present draft on my gratitude is a mere swindle  i admit nothing retorted the other but now what have you got to say to me  i am going to make a confidant of you  are you to be trusted  perhaps i dare not say yes unconditionally because im rather sociable and communicative and apt to talk in my sleep  that will do  your answer is sufficiently modest  i will venture you know captain wopper i mean you are well acquainted with his character well that kind and eccentric man has made a proposal to my dear mother which we do not like to accept and which at the same time we do not quite see our way to refuse  my mother when in great distress in switzerland was forced to borrow a small sum of money from him and thought it right to justify her doing so by letting him know what everybody alas may know nowthat we were ruined  with that ready kindness which is his chief characteristic he at once complied since our return home he has with great delicacy but much determination insisted that we shall accept from him a regular weekly allowance until we have had time to correspond with our uncle stout in california  you mustnt starve he said to my motheri give you his own wordsand youd be sure to starve if you was to try to wegitate for six months or so on atmospheric air  itll take that time before you could get a letter from willum an though your son lewis could an would work like a nigger to keep your pot bilin if he was well an hearty its as plain as the nose on your own face maam that he cant work while hes as thin as a fathom of pumpwater an as weak as a babby  now you knowat least i can tell eethat my old chum willum is as rich as a east injin nabob  you wouldnt believe madam what fortins some golddiggers have made  wy ive seed men light their pipes with fipun notes for a mere brag out there  ive made a goodish lump o money myself tooamost more than i know what to do with an as to willum i may say hes actooally rollin in gold  hes also chockfull of regard for you and yours maam  that bein so hes sure to send you somethin to tide you over yer difficulties an hes also sure to send somethin to lewis to help him start fair when he gits well and hes surest of all to send somethin to miss emma for all the kind letters shes writ to him doorin the last five or six years well then im willums buzzum friend and knowin exactly what hell say an do in the circumstances what more natral an proper than that willums chum should anticipate willums wishes and advance the money some of it at leastsay three thousand pounds to start with  now lawrence continued lewis what should we do  should we accept this offer  the good fellow has evidently made a great deal of money at the goldfields and no doubt speaks truly when he says he can afford to advance that sum  and we know our uncle williams character well enough though we have never seen him to be quite sure that he will assist my dear mother until i am able to support her  what say you  accept the offer at once said lawrence  from what i have seen of the captain i am convinced that he is a warm friend and a genuine man no doubt he can well afford to do what he proposes and his opinion of william stouts character is just for from what i know of him through mrs roby who knew him when he was a lad when his life was saved by my father he must have a kind heart  i have no doubt of it lawrence and a grateful heart too if i may judge from a few words that fell from captain wopper about your father and yourself  indeed what did he say about us  i have no right to repeat observations dropped inadvertently said lewis with a laugh  nor to raise curiosity which you dont mean to satisfy retorted his friend however my advice is that you accept the captains offer and trust to your uncles generosity    chapter twenty three  the captain surprises his friends in various ways and is himself baffled  time and tide passed onas they are proverbially said to dowithout waiting for any one  some people in the great city aware of this cavalier style of proceeding on the part of time and tide took advantage of both and scaled the pinnacled heights of society  others neglecting their opportunities or misusing them produced a series of avalanches more or less noteworthy and added a few more boulders to the vast accumulations in the great social moraine  several of the actors in this tale were among those who having learnt a few sharp lessons in the avalanche school began to note and avail themselves of time and tidenotably mrs stoutley and her son and niece  a decided change had come over the spirit of mrs stoutleys dream of life  she had at last visited the great london moraine especially that part of it called grubbs court and had already dug up a few nuggets and diamonds one of which latter she brought to her humble home in the back street with the design of polishing it into a good servantmaid  its name was netta white  mrs stoutley had formerly been a spendthrift now she was become covetous  she coveted the male diamond belonging to the same part of the moraineonce named the spider alias the impbut captain wopper had dug up that one for himself and would not part with it  gradually the good lady conceived and carried out the idea of digging out and rescuing a number of diamonds considerably lower in the scale than the netta type training them for service and taking pains to get them into good situations  it was hard work no doubt but mrs stoutley persevered and was well repaidfor the master of such labourers esteems them worthy of their hire  emma assisted in the work most heartily  it was by no means new to her  she might have directed if she had chosen but she preferred to follow  lewis recovered rapidlyso rapidly that he was soon able to resume his medical studies and prosecute them with vigour  no bad effects of the accident remained yet he was an altered mannot altered in appearance or in character but in spirit  he was still offhand in manner handsome in face and figure hearty in society but earnest and grave very gravein private  he pored over his books and strove successfully too to master the difficulties of the healing art but do what he would and fight against it as he might he was constantly distracted by a pretty face with bright sparkling eyes and a strangely sad expression coming between him and the page  he made continual inquiries after the owner of the sparkling eyes in every direction without success and at last got into the habit when walking of looking earnestly at people as if he expected to meet with some one  if i had got into this state he sometimes said to himself because of being merely in love with a pretty face i should consider myself a silly nincompoop but it is such a terrible thing for so sweet and young a creature to be chained to a man who must in the nature of things land her in beggary and break her heart  thus he deceived himself as to his main motive  poor lewis  one morning captain wopper got up a little earlier than usual and began a series of performances which mrs roby had long ago styled rampadgin round his garret  the reader may have discovered by this time that the captain was no ordinary man  whatever he did in connection with himself was done with almost superhuman energy and noise  since the commencement of his residence in the garret he had unwittingly subjected the nerves of poor mrs roby to such a variety of shocks that the mere fact of her reason remaining on its throne was an unquestionable proof of a more than usually powerful constitution  it could not well be otherwise  the captains limbs resembled the limbs of oaks in regard to size and toughness  his spirits were far above proof  his organs were cathedral organs compared with the mere barrelorgans of ordinary men on the other hand the cabin in grubbs court was but a flimsy tenement its plank floorings were thin and its beams and rafters slim and somewhat loose owing to age so that when the captain snored which he did regularly and continuously it was as if a mastiff had got inside a doublebass and were growling hideously  but mrs roby had now got pretty well accustomed to her lodgers ways her nerves had become strung to the ordeal and she even came to like the galvanic battery in which she dwelt because of its being worked by the intimate friend of her dear william such is the power of lovewe might almost say in this case of reflected love  the good old lady had even become so acute in her perceptions that without seeing the rampadger she knew precisely the part of his daily programme with which he happened to be engaged  of course the snoring told its own tale with brazentongued clamour and the whole tenement trembled all night long from top to bottom  nothing but the regardless nature of the surrounding population prevented the captain from being indicted as a nuisance but there were other sounds that were not so easily recognised  on the morning in question mrs roby lying placidly in her neat white little bed and gazing with a sweet contented face through one of her cabin windows at the bright blue sky heard a sound as though a compound animalhog and whalehad aroused itself and rolled over on its other side  a low whistling followed  mrs roby knew that the captain was pleasantly engaged with his thoughtsplanning out the proceedings of the day  suddenly the whistling ceased and was followed by a sonorous howho terminating in a gasp worthy of an express locomotive  the captain had stretched himself and mrs roby smiled at her own thoughts as well she might for they embraced the idea that a twentieth part of the force employed in that stretch would have rent in twain every tendon muscle sinew and filament in her mrs robys body  next there descended on the floor overhead a sixteenstone cannon ball which causednot the neighbours but the boards and rafters to complain  the captain was up and succeeding sounds proved that he had had another stretch for there was a bump in the middle of it which showed that forgetting his stature the careless man had hit the ceiling with his head  that was evidently a matter of no consequence  from this point the boards and rafters continued to make unceasing complaint now creaking uneasily as if under great provocation anon groaning or yelling as though under insufferable torment  from the ceiling of mrs robys room numerous small bits of plaster unable to stand it longer fell and powdered mrs robys floor  the curtains of her little bed saved her face  there was a slushing and swishing and gasping and blowing now which might have done credit to a school of porpoises  the captain was washing  something between the flapping of a main topsail in a shifting squall and the currying of a hippopotamus indicated that the captain was drying himself  the process was interrupted by an unusual though not quite unknown crash and a howl he had overturned the washhand basin and a double thump followed by heavy dabs told that the captain was on his knees swabbing it up  next instant the captains head with beard and hair in a tremendously rubbedup condition appeared upside down at the hatchway  hallo old girl has she sprung a leak anywhere  nowhere replied mrs roby with a quiet smile  she felt the question to be unnecessary  she that is the roof above her never did leak in such circumstances  if the thames had suddenly flooded the garret the captains energy was sufficient to have swabbed it up in time to prevent a drop reaching the lower deck  soon after this catastrophe there was a prolonged silence  the captain was reading  mrs roby shut her eyes and joined him in spirit thereafter the captains feet appeared at the trap where his head had been and he descended with a final and tremendous crash to the floor  see here mother he cried with a look of delight holding up a very soiled and crumpled letter thats from willum  from william exclaimed the old woman eagerly why when did you get it the postman cant have been here this morning  of course he hasnt i got it last night from the limbothelaw that looks after my little matters  i came in late and you were asleep so i kep it to whet yer appetite for breakfast  now listen you must take it first ill get you breakfast afterwards  the captain had by this time got into the way of giving the old woman her breakfast in bed every morning  go on said the old woman nodding  the captain spread out the letter on his knee with great care and read aloud    my dear wopper got yer letter all right    my blissin to the poor widdy  help her ov coorse ill help her   you did right in advancin the money though you fell short by a long   way when you advanced so little  howsever no matter  i gave you   my last will an testimony wen we parted  heres a noo un

love and   blissin give two to mister lewis with my compliments an give four   to young lawrence with my benediction for his fathers sake  as for   the old ooman roby you dont need to give nothin to her  she and i   understand each other  ill look after her myself  ill make her   my residooary legatee an wotever else is needful but in the   meantime you may as well see that shes got all that she wants   build her a noo house too  im told that grubbs court aint exactly   aristocratic or clean see to that  wotever you advance out o yer   own pocket ill pay back with interest  thats to begin with tell   em  theres more comin  thereim used up wi writin such a long   screed  id raither dig a twentyfutt hole in clay sile any day   yours to command willum    psyou aint comin back soonare you  now mother what dee think o that said the captain folding the letter and putting it in his pocket  its a good kind letterjust like william answered the old woman  well so im inclined to think rejoined the captain busying himself about breakfast while he spoke it provides for everybody in a sort o way and encourages em to go on hopeful likedont it strike you so then you see thats four to miss emma and four to dr lawrence which would be eight equal to four hundred a year and that with the practice hes gettin into would make it six or thereaboutsnot bad to begin with eh  the captain followed his remark with a sigh  whats the matter asked mrs roby  why you remember mother before goin abroad i set my heart on these two gettin spliced but i fear its no go  sometimes i think they looks fond o one another at other times i dont  its a puzzler theyre both young an goodlookin an good  what more would they have  perhaps they want money suggested the old woman  you say dr lawrences income just now is about two hundred well gentlefolks find it summat difficult to keep house on that though its plenty for the likes of you an me  thats true  praps the doctor is sheerin off for fear o draggin a young creeter into poverty  it never struck me in that light before  beaming under the influence of this hopeful view of the case the captain proceeded to make another move in the complicated game which he had resolved to play out and win but this move which he had considered one of the easiest of all proved to be the most unfortunate or rather unmanageable  now mother said he i mean to make a proposal to ee before going out for the day so that you may have time to think over it  this cabin o yours aint just the thing you knowraither dirty and too high in the clouds by a long way so ive bin an seen a noo house on the river not unlike this one an i wants you to shift your berth  what say eeeh  to the captains surprise and dismay the old woman shook her head decidedly and no argument which he could bring to bear had the least effect on her  she had in fact got used to her humble old home and attached to it and could not bear the thought of leaving it  having exhausted his powers of suasion in vain he left her to think over it and sallied forth crestfallen  however he consoled himself with the hope that time and consideration would bring her to a right state of mind  meanwhile he would go to the parties interested and communicate the contents of willums letter  he went first to doctor lawrence who was delighted as well as pleased at what it contained  the captain at first read only the clauses which affected his friends the stoutleys and said nothing about that which referred to the doctor himself  so you see doctor im off to let the stoutleys know about this little matter and just looked in on you in passing  it was very kind of you captain  not at all by no means returned the captain pulling out a large claspknife with which he proceeded carefully to pare his left thumb nail  by the way doctor he said carelessly were you ever in love  lawrence flushed and cast a quick glance at his interrogator who however was deeply engaged with the thumb nail  well i suppose men at my time of life he replied with a laugh have had some  of courseof course interrupted the other but i mean that i wonder a strapping young fellow like you with such a good practice dont get married  the doctor who had recovered himself laughed and said that his good practice was chiefly among the poor and that even if he wished to marryor rather if any one would have himhe would never attempt to win a girl while he had nothing better than two hundred a year and prospects to offer her  then i suppose you would marry if you had something better to offer said the captain finishing off the nail and shutting the claspknife with a snap  again the doctor laughed wondered why the captain had touched on such a theme and said that he couldnt exactly say what he might or might not do if circumstances were altered  the captain was baffled  however he said that circumstances were altered and after reading over the latter part of willums letter left lawrence to digest it at his leisure  we need not follow him on his mission  suffice it to say that he carried no small amount of relief to the minds of mrs stoutley and her household and thereafter met gillie by appointment at charing cross whence he went to kensington to see a villa with a view to purchasing it  at night he again essayed to move mrs robys resolution and many a time afterwards attacked her but always with the same result although as he said he fought like a trueblue british seaman and gave her broadside after broadside as fast as he could load and fire he made no impression on her whatever  she had nailed her colours to the mast and would never give in    chapter twenty four  in which tremendous forces come to the captains aid  it is probable that most people can recall occasions when circumstances have done for them that which they have utterly failed to effect for themselves  some time after the failure of captain woppers little plots and plans in regard to mrs roby circumstances favoured himthe wind shifted round so to speak and blew right astern  to continue our metaphor it blew a tremendous gale and the captains ends were gained at last only by the sinking of the ship  this is how it happened  one afternoon the captain was walking rather disconsolately down the strand in company with his satellitewe might almost say his confidant  the street was very crowded insomuch that at one or two crossings they were obliged to stand a few minutes before venturing overnot that the difficulty was great many active men being seen to dodge among the carts drays vans and busses with marvellous ease and safety but the captain was cautious  he was wont to say that he warnt used to sail in such crowded watersthere warnt enough o sea room for himhed rather layto or standoffanon for half a day than risk being run down by them shoregoin crafts  everything in life seems to go wrong at times muttered the captain as he and the satellite layto at one of these crossings  yes its coorious aint it sir said gillie an at other times everything seems to go rightdont it sir  true my lad thats a better view to take of it returned the captain cheerfully come well heave ahead  as they were heaving along in silence the rattle and noise around them being unsuited to conversation they suddenly became aware that the ordinary din of the strand swelled into a furious roar  gillie was half way up a lamppost in an instant from which elevated position he looked down on the captain and said  a ingine  what sort of a ingine my lad  a fire hooray shouted gillie with glittering eyes and flushed countenance look out cappen keep close longside o me under the lee o the lamppost  its not a bad buffer though never quite a sure one bein carried clean away sometimes by the wheels wen theres a bad driver  as he spoke the most intense excitement was manifested in the crowded thoroughfare  whips were flourished cabmen shouted horses reared vehicles of all kinds scattered right and left even although there had seemed almost a block two seconds before  timid foot passengers rushed into shops bold ones mounted steps and kerbstones or stood on tiptoe and the captain towering over the crowd saw the gleam of brass helmets as the charioteer clove his way through the swaying mass  there is something powerfully exciting to most minds in the sight of men rushing into violent action especially when the action may possibly involve life and death  the natural excitement aroused in the captains breast was increased by the deep bass nautical roar that met his ear every man in the london firebrigade is or used to be a picked manofwarsman and the shouting necessary in such a thoroughfare to make people get out of the way was not only tremendous but unceasing it was as though a dozen mad bosns capped with brazen warhelmets had been let loose on london society through which they tore at full gallop behind three powerful horses on a hissing and smoking monster of brass and iron  a bomb shell from a twentyfiveton gun could scarce have cut a lane more effectually  the captain took off his hat and cheered in sympathy  the satellite almost dropped from the lamppost with excess of feeling  the crash and roar increased culminated rushed past and gone in a moment  gillie dropped to the ground as if he had been shot seized the captains hand and attempted to drag him along  he might as well have tried to drag vesuvius from its base but the captain was willing  a hansomcab chanced to be in front of them as they dashed into the road the driver smoking and cool as a cucumber being used to such incidents he held up a finger  quick in with you cappen  gillie got behind his patron and in attempting to expedite his movements with a push almost sent him out at the other side  after the ingineslap yelled gillie to the face which looked down through the conversationhole in the roof double extra fare if you look sharp  the cabman was evidently a sympathetic soul  he followed in the wake of the fireengine as well as he could but it was a difficult process for while the world at large made way for it nobody cared a straw for him  aint it fun said gillie as he settled his panting little body on the cushion beside his friend and master  not bad responded the captain who half laughed at the thought of being so led away by excitement and a small boy  id give up all my bright prospects of advancement in life continued gillie to be a fireman  theres no fun goin equal to a fire  praps it dont seem quite so funny to them as is bein burnt out suggested the captain  of course it dont but that cant be helped you knowcan it sir what cant be cured must be endoored as the proverb says  get along old fellow dont spare his ribsdouble fare you know well lose em if you dont  the latter part of the remark was shouted through the hole to the cabman who however pulled up instead of complying  its of no use sir he said looking down at the captain ive lost sight of em  gillie was on the pavement in a moment  never mind cappen give him five bob an decline the change come along  i see em go past the bridge so ten to one its down about the docks somewheresthe wust place in london for a fire wich of course means the best  the idea of its being so afforded such unalloyed pleasure to gillie that he found it hard to restrain himself and accommodate his pace to that of his friend  it soon became very evident that the fire was in truth somewhere about the docks for not only was a dense cloud of smoke seen rising in that direction but fireengines began to dash from side streets everywhere and to rush towards the smoke as if they were sentient things impatient for the fray  the cause of such unusual vigour and accumulation of power was that a fire anywhere about the docks is deemed preeminently dangerous owing to the great and crowded warehouses being stuffed from cellars to rooftrees with combustibles  the docks in regard to fire form the citadel of london  if the enemy gets a footing there he must be expelled at all hazards and at any cost  as the captain and his protege hurried along they were naturally led in the direction of their home  a vague undefined fear at the same instant took possession of both for they glanced gravely at each other without speaking and as if by mutual consent began to run  gillie had no need now to complain of his companions pace  he had enough to do to keep up with it  there were many runners besides themselves now for the fire was obviously near at hand and the entire population of the streets seemed to be pressing towards it  a few steps more brought them in sight of the head of grubbs court  here several fireengines were standing in full play surrounded by a swaying mass of human beings still there was no sign of the precise locality of the fires for the tall houses hid everything from view save the dense cloud which overshadowed them all  even captain woppers great strength would have been neutralised in such a crowd if it had not now been seconded by an excitement and anxiety that nothing could resist  he crushed his way through as if he had been one of the steam fireengines gillie holding tight to the stout tails of his monkey jacket  several powerful roughs came in his way and sought to check him  the captain had hitherto merely used his shoulders and his weight  to the roughs he applied a fistright and leftand two went down  a few seconds brought him to the cordon of policemen they had seen him approaching and one placed himself in front of the captain with the quiet air of a man who is accustomed never to give way to physical force  i live down grubbs court my man said the captain with an eager respectful air for he was of a lawabiding spirit  the constable stepped aside and nodded gravely  the captain passed the line but gillie was pounced upon as if he had been a mouse and the constable a cat  he belongs to me cried the captain turning back on hearing gillies yell of despair  the boy was released and both flew down the court on the pavement of which the snakelike waterhose lay spirting at its seams  its in the cabin said the captain in a low deep voice as he dashed into the court where a crowd of firemen were toiling with cool quiet yet tremendous energy  no crowd interrupted them here save the few frantic inhabitants of the court who were screaming advice and doing nothing but no attention whatever was paid to them  a foreman of the brigade stood looking calmly upwards engaged in lowtoned conversation with a brother fireman as if they were discussing theories of the picturesque and beautiful with special application to chimneycans clouds of smoke and leaping tongues of fire  immense engine power had been brought to bear and one of the gigantic floatingengines of the thames had got near enough to shower tons of water over the buildings still it was a matter of uncertainty whether the fire could be confined to the court where it had originated  the result of the foremans quiet talk was that the brotherfireman suddenly seized a nozzle from a comrade and made a dash at the door leading up to the cabin  flames and smoke drove him back instantly  it was at this moment that captain wopper came on the scene  without a moments hesitation he rushed towards the same door  the foreman seized his arm  its of no use sir you cant do it  the captain shook him off and sprang in  a few seconds and he rushed out choking scorched and with his eyes starting almost out of their sockets  it is of no use sir remonstrated the foreman besides the people have all bin got out im told  no they avent cried mrs white coming up at the moment frantically wringing the last article of linen on which she had been professionally engaged mrs robys there yet  all right sir said the foreman with that quiet comforting intonation which is peculiar to men of power resource and selfreliance come to the back  the escape will be up immediately it couldnt get down the court owin to some masonry that was piled there and had to be sent round  quick to understand the captain followed the fireman and reached the back of the house on the riverside just as the towering head of the escape emerged from a flanking alley  this way  the small window on the right at the topso  the ladder was barely placed when the captain sprang upon it and ran up as many a time before he had run up the shrouds of his own vessel  a cheer from the crowd below greeted this display of activity but it was changed into a laugh when the captain finding the window shut and bolted want into the room head first carrying frame and glass along with him  divesting himself of the uncomfortable necklace he looked hastily round  the smoke was pretty thick but not sufficiently so to prevent his seeing poor mrs roby lying on the floor as if she had fallen down suffocated  cheer up old lass he cried kneeling and raising her head tenderly  is that you cappen said the old woman in a weak voice  come weve no time to lose  let me lift you the place is all alight i thought you was choked  choked oh dear no replied the old woman but ive always heard that in a fire you should keep your face close to the ground for air ah gently cappen dear  while she was speaking the captain was getting her tucked under his strong right arm  he could have whisked her on his shoulder in a moment but was afraid of her poor old bones and treated her as if she had been a fragile china teacup of great value  next moment he was out on the escape and reached the ground amid ringing cheers  he carried her at once to the nearest place of safety and committing her to the care of mrs white rushed back to the scene of conflagration just as they were about to remove the escape  stop shouted the captain springing on it  theres nobody else up is there cried a fireman as the captain ran up  no nobody  come down then directly roared the fireman the escape is wanted elsewhere  come down i say or well leave you  youre welcome to leave me roared the captain as he stepped into the window only hold your noise an mind your own business  with a mingled feeling of amusement and indignation they hurried away with the escape  it had been urgently wanted to reach a commanding position whence to assail the fire  the order to send it was peremptory so the captain was left in his uncomfortable situation with the smoke increasing around him and the fire roaring underneath  the actions of our seaman were now curious as well as prompt  taking a blanket from his old friends bed he spread it below the chimneypiece and in a remarkably short time pulled down without damaging every object on the wall and threw it into the blanket  he then added to the heap the chinese lantern the turkish scimitar the new zealand club the eastern shield the ornamented dagger the worsted work sampler the souwester the oiled coat the telescope the framed sheet of the flags of all nations and the small portrait of the seacaptain in his gotomeetin clothes also the big bible and a very small box which latter contained mrs robys limited wardrobe  he tied all up in a tight bundle  a coil of rope hung on a peg on the wall  the bundle was fastened to the end of it and lowered to the ground amid a fire of remarks from the crowd which were rather caustic and humorous than complimentary  gillie shouted the captain cast off the rope lad and look well after the property  ay ay cappen replied the youth taking up a thick cartpin or something of the sort that lay near and mounting guard  there was another laugh from crowd and firemen at the nautical brevity and promptitude of gillie  at every large fire in london there may be seen a few firemen standing about in what an ignorant spectator might imagine to be easy indifference and idleness but these men are not idlers  they are resting  the men who first arrive at a fire go into action with the utmost vigour and toil until their powers are nearlysometimes quite exhausted  as time passes fresh men are continually arriving from the more distant stations  these go into action as they come up thus relieving the others who stand aloof for a time looking on or doing easy work and recruiting their energies  it was these men who watched the captains proceedings with much amusement while their comrades were doing battle with the foe  presently the captain reappeared at the window and lowered a huge seachest  a third time he appeared with the model of a fullrigged ship in his hand  this time he let the end of the rope down and then getting over the window slid easily to the ground  youre uncommon careful o your property exclaimed one of the onlookers with a broad grin  taint all my property lad replied the captain with a goodhumoured nod most of it is a poor old oomans belongings  so saying he got a man to carry his seachest himself shouldered the bundle gillie was intrusted with the fullrigged model and thus laden they left the scene followed by another laugh and a hearty cheer  but our bluff seaman was not content with rescuing mrs roby and her property  he afterwards proceeded to lend his effective aid to all who desired his assistance and did not cease his exertions until evening by which time the fire was happily subdued  she must not be moved tonight captain said dr lawrence for whom gillie had been sent the place where she lies is doubtless far from comfortable but i have got her to sleep and it would be a pity to awake her  tomorrow we shall get her into more comfortable quarters  could she bear movin tomorrow a mile or so asked the captain  certainly but there is no occasion to go so far  lodgings are to be had  all right doctor ive got a lodging ready for her and will ask you to come an have potluck with us before long  gillie my lad you go hail a cab and then come back to lend a hand wi the cargo  in a few minutes the pair were whirling towards the west end of london and were finally landed with their cargo on the banks of the thames above the bridges near the new building which captain wopper had named after its prototype the cabin  to fit this up after the fashion of the old place was a comparatively short and easy work for two such handy labourers  before they left that night it was so like its predecessor in all respects except dirt that both declared it to be the identical same craft in shape and rig even to the little bed and curtains  next afternoon mrs roby was brought to it by captain wopper in a specially easy carriage hired for the purpose  the poor old woman had received more of a shock than she was willing to admit and did exactly as she was bid with many a sigh however at the thought of having been burnt out of the old home  she was carried up the stair in a chair by two porters and permitted the captain to draw a thick veil over her head to conceal as he said her blushes from the men  he also took particular care to draw the curtains of the bed close round her after she had been laid in it and then retired to allow her to be disrobed by netta who had been obtained from mrs stoutley on loan expressly for the occasion  much of this care to prevent her seeing the place that day however was unnecessary  the poor old creature was too much wearied by the short journey to look at anything  after partaking of a little tea and toast she fell into a quiet sleep which was not broken till late on the following morning  her first thought on waking was the fire  her second the captain  he was in the room she knew because he was whistling in his usual low tone while moving about the fireplace preparing breakfast  she glanced at the curtains her own curtains certainlyand the bed too  much surprised she quietly put out her thin hand and drew the curtain slightly aside  the captain in his shirt sleeves as usual preparing buttered toast the fireplace the old kettle with the defiant spout singing away as defiantly as ever the various photographs potlids and other ornaments above the fireplace the two little windows commanding an extensive prospect of the sky from the spot where she lay the fullrigged ship the chinese lantern hanging from the beam everything just as it should be  well well thought mrs roby with a sigh of relief the fire must have been a dream after all but what a vivid one  she coughed  the captain was at her side instantly  slept well old girl  very well thank you  ive had such a queer dream dyou know  have you  take your breakfast mother before tellin it  its all readythere fire away  it was such a vivid one she resumed when half through her third cup all about a fire and you were in it too  here she proceeded to relate her dream with the most circumstantial care  the captain listened with patient attention till she had finished and then said  it was no dream mother  its said that the great fire of london was a real blessin to the city  the last fire in london will i hope be a blessin to you an me  it was real enough and terrible too but through gods mercy you have been saved from it  i managed to save your little odds and ends too  this is the noo cabin mother that you wouldnt consent to come to  something like the old one aint it  mrs roby spoke never a word but looked round the room in bewilderment taking the captains hand she kissed it and gazed at him and the room until she fell asleep  awaking again in half an hour she finished her breakfast asked for the old bible and declaring herself content fell straightway into her old ways and habits    chapter twenty five  an unexpected gem found  although lewis stoutley found it extremely difficult to pursue his studies with the profusely illustrated edition of medical works at his command he nevertheless persevered with a degree of calm steady resolution which might be almost styled heroic  to tear out the illustrations was impossible for nitas portrait was stamped on every page compelling him to read the letterpress through it  success however attended his labours for he not only carried out the regular course but he attached himself to the poor district of the moraine which had been appropriated as their own by his mother and emma who ministered to the bodies of the sick while they sought to bring their souls to the good physician  this professional work he did as a sort of amateur being only a student under the guidance of his friend lawrence whose extending practice included that district  it happened also to be the district in which mrs robys new cabin was situated  these labourers in what dr tough had styled the london gold fields not only did good to the people and to themselves in the prosecution of them but resulted occasionally in their picking up a nugget or a diamond which was quite a prize  one such was found by lewis about this time which although sadly dim and soiled when first discovered proved to be such a precious and sparkling gem that he resolved to wear it himself  he and emma one day paid a visit to the cabin where they found old mrs roby alone and had a long chat with her chiefly about the peculiarities of the captain and his boy  by the way said mrs roby to lewis when they rose to go a poor woman was here just before you came askin if i knew where she could find a doctor for her father she said was very ill  the two have come to live in a room near the foot of this stair it seems and they appear to be very poor  i could not give her dr lawrences new address for i dont know it so i advised her to apply to the nearest chemist  perhaps mr lewis youll go yourself and see the poor man  willingly and i shall myself call for lawrence on my way home and send him if necessary  come emma  perhaps this may be a case for the exercise of your philanthropy  they soon found the place and knocked at a low door which was slowly opened by a middleaged woman meanly clad and apparently very poor  ah sir youre too late hes dead said the woman in reply to lewiss inquiry  o how sad broke from emmas sympathetic spirit i am so sorry we are too late  did you find a doctor  no maam i didnt but the chemist gave me the address of one so i ran back to tell the poor young thing that id go fetch one as quick as i could and i found him just dying in her arms  in whose arms are not you the daughter said emma  me miss oh dear no  im only a neighbour  has she any friends asked lewis  none as i knows of  they are strangers hereonly just came to the room  there it is she added stepping back and pointing to an inner door  lewis advanced and knocked but received no answer  he knocked again still no answer  he therefore ventured to lift the latch and enter  it was a miserable illlighted room of small size and destitute of all furniture save a truckle bed a heap of clean straw in a corner on which lay a black shawl a deal chair and a small table  abject poverty was stamped on the whole place  on the bed lay the dead man covered with a sheet  beside it kneeled or rather lay the figure of a woman  her dress was a soiled and rusty black  her hair fallen from its fastenings hung dishevelled on her shoulders  her arms clasped the dead form  my poor woman whispered emma as she knelt beside her and put a hand timidly on her shoulder  but the woman made no answer  she has fainted i think exclaimed emma rising quickly and trying to raise the womans head  suddenly lewis uttered a great cry lifted the woman in his arms and gazed wildly into her face  nita he cried passionately clasping her to his heart and covering the poor faded face with kisses but nita heard not  it seemed as if the silver chord had already snapped  becoming suddenly aware of the impropriety as well as selfishness of his behaviour lewis hastily bore the inanimate form to the heap of straw pillowed the small head on the old shawl and began to chafe the hands while emma aided him to restore consciousness  they were soon successful  nita heaved a sigh  now emma said lewis rising this is your place just now i will go and fetch something to revive her  he stopped for one moment at the bed in passing and lifted the sheet there was no mistaking the handsome face of the count even in death  it was terribly thin but the lines of sorrow and anxiety were gone at last from the marble brow and a look of rest pervaded the whole countenance  on returning lewis found that nita had thrown her arms round emmas neck and was sobbing violently  she looked up as he entered and held out her hand  god has sent you she said looking at emma to save my heart from breaking  lewis again knelt beside her and put her hand to his lips but he had no power to utter a word  presently as the poor girls eye fell on the bed there was a fresh outburst of grief  oh how he loved meand how nobly he foughtand how gloriously he conqueredgod be praised for that  she spoke or rather sobbed in broken sentences  to distract her mind if possible even for a little from her bereavement emma ventured to ask her how she came there when her father became so ill and similar questions  little by little in brief sentences and with many choking words and tears the sad story came out  ever since the night when her father met with lewis at saxon he had firmly resisted the temptation to gamble  god had opened his ear to listen to and his heart to receive the saviour  arriving in london with the money so generously lent to them by lewis they took a small lodging and sought for work  god was faithful to his promises she said he had sent a measure of prosperity  her father taught music she obtained needlework  all was going well when her father became suddenly ill  slowly but steadily he sank  the teaching had to be given up the hours of labour with the needle increased  this coupled with constant nursing began to sap her own strength but she had been enabled to hold out until her father became so ill that she dared not leave him even for a few minutes to visit the shops where she had obtained sewingwork then all source of livelihood being dried up she had been compelled to sell one by one the few articles of clothing and furniture which they had begun to accumulate about them  thus she said in conclusion we were nearly reduced to a state of destitution but before absolute want had been felt by us god mercifully took my darling father homeandandi shall soon join him  say not so darling said emma twining her arms round the poor stricken girl  it may be that he has much work for you to do for jesus here before he takes you home  meanwhile he has sent us to claim you as our very dear friendas our sister  you must come and stay with mamma and me  we too have tasted something of that cup of adversity which you have drained to the very dregs my poor nita but we are comparatively well off now  mamma will be so glad to have you  say you will come  wont you dearest  nita replied by lifting her eyes with a bewildered look to the bed and again burst into a passion of uncontrollable sorrow    chapter twenty six  the denouement  being naturally a straightforward man and not gifted with much power in the way of plotting and scheming captain wopper began in time to discover that he had plunged his mental faculties into a disagreeable state of confusion  gillie my lad he said looking earnestly at his satellite while they walked one afternoon along the bayswater road in the direction of kensington its a bad business altogether  gillie not having the smallest idea what the captain referred to admitted that it was wery bad indeed but suggested that it might be wuss  its such a perplexin state o things pursued the captain to be always bouncin up an down wi hopes an fears an disappointments like a mad barometer not knowin rightly whats what or whos who  uncommon perplexin assented gillie  if i was you cappen id heave the barometer overboard along wi the maindeck nail yer colours to the mast cram the rudder into the leescuppers kick up your flyinjibboom into the new moon an go down stern foremost like a man  ha said the captain with a twinkle in the corner of his weathereye not a bad notion  now my lad im goin out to my villa at kensington to dine  theres to be company too an youre to be waiter  stooard you mean  well yesstooard  now stooard youll keep a good lookout an clap as tight a stopper on yer tongue as may be  ive got a little plot in hand dee see an i want you to help me with it  keep your eye in a quiet way on dr lawrence and miss gray  ive taken a fancy that perhaps they may be in love with each other  you just let me have your opinion on that pint after dinner but have a care that you dont show what youre up to and whatever you do dont be cheeky  all right said the stooard thrusting both hands into his trouserpockets ill do my best  while these two were slowly wending their way through kensington gardens emma gray arrived at the captains villacalifornia cottage he called itand rang the bell  the gate was opened by netta white who although not much bigger than when first introduced to the reader was incomparably more beautiful and smart  mrs stoutley had reason to be proud of her  i did not know that you were to be here netta said emma in surprise as she entered  it was a very sudden call miss said netta with a smile  captain wopper wrote a note to me begging me to ask mrs stoutley to be so good as lend me to him for a day to help at his housewarming  here is the letter miss  emma laughed as she glanced carelessly at the epistle but became suddenly grave turned white then red and snatching the letter from the girls hand gazed at it intently  la  miss is anything wrong  may i keep this asked emma  certainly miss if you wish it  before she could say anything more they were interrupted by the entrance of dr lawrence  with a surprised look and smile he said  i have been invited to dine with our friend captain wopper but did not anticipate the pleasure of meeting miss gray here  emma explained that she also had been invited to dine with the captain along with her mother and brother but had supposed that that was all the party as he the captain had mentioned no one else and had been particular in begging her to come an hour before the time for the purpose of going over his new villa with him and giving him her private opinion of it  i am punctual she added consulting her watch it is just four oclock  four  then what is the dinner hour  five answered emma  the captains wits must have been woolgathering rejoined lawrence with a laugh  he told me to come punctually at four  however i rejoice in the mistake as it gives me the great pleasure of assisting you to form an unprejudiced opinion of the merits of the new villa shall we begin with an exploration of the garden  emma had no cause to blush at such an innocent proposal nevertheless a richer colour than usual mantled on her modest little face as she fell in with the doctors humour and stepped out into the small piece of ground behind the house  it was of very limited extent and although not surrounded too closely by other villas was nevertheless thoroughly overlooked by them so that seclusion in that garden was impossible  recognising this fact a former proprietor had erected at the lower end of the garden a bower so contrived that its interior was invisible from all points except one and that was a side door to the garden which opened on a little passage by which coals milk meat and similar substances were conveyed from the front to the rear of the house  dr lawrence and emma walked round and round the garden very slowly conversing earnestly  strange to say they quite forgot the object which had taken them there  their talk was solely of switzerland  as it continued the doctors voice deepened in tones and interest and his fair companions cheek deepened in colour  suddenly they turned into the bower  as they did so gillie white chanced to appear at the garden door above referred to which stood ajar  the spiders countenance was a speaking one  during the five minutes which it appeared in the doorway it and the body belonging to it became powerfully eloquent it might have conveyed to ones mind as it were a series of tableaux vivants  gillies first look was as if he had been struck dumb with amazement that was lawrence suddenly seizing one of emmas hands in both of his and looking intently into her face  then gillies look of amazement gave place to one of intense quite touchingwe might almost say sympatheticanxiety as he placed a hand on each knee and stooped that was the doctors right hand stealing round emmas waist and emma shrinking from him with averted face  the urchins visage suddenly lighted up with a blaze of triumph and he seized his cap as if about to cheer that was the doctors superior strength prevailing and emmas head now turned the other way laid on his shoulder  all at once gillie went into quiet convulsions grinned from ear to ear doubled himself up slapped his thigh inaudiblya la captain wopperand otherwise behaved like an outrageous yet selfrestrained maniac that waswell we have no right to say what that was  as a faithful chronicler however we must report that onehalf minute later the stooard found captain wopper in the villa drawingroom and there stated to him that it was hall right that he didnt need for to perplex hisself about doctor lawrence and miss hemma gray for that they was as good as spliced already having been seen by him gillie in the bower at the end of the garding ablushin and a here the spider stopped short and went into another fit of convulsionsthis time unrestrained  is it necessary to say that captain wopper sat at the foot of his own table that daymrs stoutley being at the headwith his rugged visage radiant and his powerful voice explosive that he told innumerable seastories without point and laughed at them without propriety that in the excess of his hilarity he drank a mysterious toast to the success of all sorts of engagements present and future that he called mrs stoutley in joke sister and emma and lewis also in joke niece and neffy that he called doctor lawrence neffy too with a pointedness and a sense of its being the richest possible joke that covered with confusion the affianced pair and with surprise the rest of the company that he kicked the stooard amicably out of the room for indulging in explosions of laughter behind his chair and recommending him the captain to go it strong and to clap on sail till he should tear the mast out of er or git blowed on his beamends that the stooard returned unabashed to repeat the offence unreproved that towards the end the captain began a longwinded graphic story which served to show how his good friend and chum willum stout in callyforny had commissioned him to buy and furnish a villa for the purpose of presenting it to a certain young lady in token of his gratitood to her for bein such a good and faithful correspondent to him willum while he was in furrin parts also how he was commissioned to buy and furnish another villa and present it to a certain doctor whose father had saved him from drownin long long ago he would not say how long ago and how that this villa in which they was feedin was one of the said villas and that he found it quite unnecessary to spend any more of willums hardearned gains in the purchase of the other villa owing to circumstances which had took place in a certain bower that very day  is it necessary we again ask to detail all this  we think not therefore we wont  when reference was made to the bower emma could stand or sit it no longer  she rose hastily and ran blushing into the garden  captain wopper uttered a thunderous laugh rose and ran after her  he found her in the bower with her face in her hands and sat down beside her  captain wopper she suddenly exclaimed looking up and drawing a note from her pocket do you know this  yes duckie the captain was quite reckless now its my last billydoo to netta white  i never was good at pothooks and hangers  and do you know this letter said emma holding up to the seamans eyes her uncle williams last letter to herself  the captain looked surprised then became suddenly red and confused  wyyees its willums aint it  the same pothooks and hangers precisely said emma are they not oh she exclaimed throwing her arms round the captains neck and kissing him uncle william how could you deceive us so  the captain to use his own expressions was taken abackfairly brought up all standin  it had never occurred to his innocent mind that he should commit himself so simply  he felt an unconquerable objection to expressions of gratitude and perceiving with deep foresight that such were impending his first impulse was to rise and fly but emmas kiss made him change his mind  he returned it in kind but not in degree for it caused the bower to resound as with a pistol shot  oh wot a cracker aint it just youre a nice man aint you to go poachin on other fellers  the captain seized his opportunity he broke from emma and dashed wildly at the spider who incontinently fled down the conduit for coals cheering with the fury of a victorious ashantee chief    chapter twenty seven  the last  humbly confessing to emma gray that he had no talent whatever for plotting captain wopper went off with a deprecatory expression of countenance to reveal himself to mrs roby  great was his anxiety  he entered her presence like a guilty thing  if however his anxiety was great his surprise and consternation were greater when she received his revelation with tears and for some time refused to be comforted  the workings of the human mind are wonderful  sometimes they are as the captain said bamboozling  if analysed it might have been discovered that apart altogether from the shock of unexpectedness and the strain on her credulity poor mrs roby sufferedwithout clearly understanding itfrom a double loss  she had learned to love captain wopper for his own sake and now captain wopper was lost to her in william stout  on the other hand william her darling her smoothfaced chubby boy was lost to her for ever in the hairy savage captain wopper it was perplexing as well as heartrending  captain wopper was gone because properly there was no such being in existence  william stout was gone because he would never write to her any more and could never more return to her from california  it was of no use that the captain expressed the deepest contrition for the deception he had practised urging that he had done it for the best the old woman only wept the more but when in desperation the captain hauled taut the sheets of his intellect got well to windard of the old ooman an gave her a broadside of philosophy he was more successful  mother he said earnestly you dont feel easy under this breeze cause why youre entirely on the wrong tack  ready about now an see what a change itll make  look ee here  youve gained us both instead of lost us both  here am i willum stout yours to command a trifle stouter it may be and hairier than i once was not to say older but by a long chalk better able to love the old girl who took me in an befriended me when i was a reglar castaway with dirty weather brewin an the rocks o destitootion close under my lee and wholl never forget your kindness no never so long as two timbers of the old hulk hold together  well then thats the view over the starboard bulwarks  cast your eyes over to port now  here am i captain wopper also yours to command strong as a horse as fond o you as if you was my own mother an resolved to stick by you through thick and thin to the last  so you see youve got us bothwillum an meme an willum both of us lovin you like blazes an lookin arter you like dootiful sons  a double tide of affection so to speak flowin like strong doublestout from the beer barrel out of which you originally drew me if i may say so  aint you convinced  mrs roby was convinced  she gave in and lived for many years afterwards in the full enjoyment of the double blessing which had thus fallen to her lot in the evening of her days  and here good reader we might close our tale but we cannot do so without a few parting words in reference to the various friends in whose company we have travelled so long  of course it is unnecessary to say especially to our lady readers who were no doubt quite aware of it from the beginning that lawrence and emma lewis and nita were in the course of time duly married  the love of their respective wives for each other induced the husbands not only to dwell in adjoining villas but to enter into a medical copartnery in the prosecution of which they became professionally the deities and privately the adored of a large population of invalids with their more or less healthy friendsin the salubrious neighbourhood of kensington  to go about doing good was the business and became the second nature of the young doctors  it was long a matter of great surprise to not a few of their friends that though lawrence and lewis neither smoked nor drank they were uncommonly healthy and apparently happy  some caustic spirits asserted that they were sure budding wings were to be found on the shoulders of the two doctors but we are warranted in asserting on the best authority that on a strict examination nothing of the kind was discovered  need we say that emma and nita were pattern wives  of course not therefore we wont say it our reticence on this point will no doubt be acceptable to those who being themselves naughty dont believe in or admire patterns even though these be of heavenly things  it is astonishing though what an effect their socalled perfection had in tightening the bonds of matrimony  furthermore they had immense families of sons and daughters insomuch that it became necessary to lengthen their cords and strengthen their stakes and calyforny villa became a mere bandbox compared to the mansions which they ultimately called home  mrs stoutley having managed to get entirely out of herselfchiefly by means of the bible and the london goldfields and morainesbecame so amiable and so unlike her former self and withal so healthy and cheery that the two great families of stoutley and lawrence went to war for possession of her  the feud at last threatened to become chronic and was usually carried to an excess of virulence about christmas and new year time  in order therefore to the establishment of peace mrs stoutley agreed to live onehalf of the year with lewis and the other half with lawrencelewis to have the larger half as a matter of course but she retained her cottage in notting hill and her maid netta white with the right to retire at any moment when the exigencies of the goldfields or the moraines demanded special attention or when the excess of juvenile life in the mansions before mentioned became too much for her  on these occasions of retirement which to say truth were not very frequent she was accompanied by netta whitefor netta loved her mistress and clave to her as ruth to naomi  being a native of the fields she was an able and sympathetic guide and adviser at all times and nothing pleased netta better than a visit to grubbs court for there she saw the blessed fruit of diamond and gold digging illustrated in the person of her own reformed father and happy mother who had removed from their former damp rooms on the ground floor to the more salubrious apartments among the chimney pots which had been erected on the site of the cabin after the fire  directly below them in somewhat more pretentious apartments shone another rescued diamond in the person of fred leven  he was now the support and comfort of his old mother as well as of a pretty little young woman who had loved him even while he was a drunkard and who had it been otherwise decreed would have gone on loving him and mourning over him and praying for him till he was dead  in her case however the mourning had been turned into joy  in process of time gillie white alias the spider became a sturdy squareset active little man and was promoted to the position of coachman in the family of lewis stoutley  susan quick served in the same family in the capacity of nurse for many years and being naturally thrown much into the society of the young coachman was finally induced to cement the friendship which had begun in switzerland by a wedding  this wedding gillie often declared to susan with much earnestness was the stunninest ewent that had ever occurred to him in his private capacity as a man  there is a proverb which asserts that it never rains but it pours this proverb was verified in the experience of the various personages of our tale for soon after the tide of fortune had turned in their favour the first showers of success swelled into absolute cataracts of prosperity  among other things the gowrong mines suddenly went right mrs stoutleys former man of business mr temple called one day and informed her that her shares in that splendid undertaking had been purchased on her behalf by a friend who had faith in the ultimate success of the mines that the friend forbade the mention of his name and that he mr temple had called to pay her her dividends and to congratulate her on her recovery of health and fortune  dr toughwho when his services were no longer required owing to the absence of illness had continued his visits as a jovial friendchanced to call at the same time with mr temple and added his congratulations to those of the man of business observing with enthusiasm that the air of the swiss mountains mixed in equal parts with that of the london diamondfields would cure any disease under the sun  his former patient heartily agreed with him but said that the medicine in question was not a mere mixture but a chemical compound containing an element higher than the mountains and deeper than the diamondfields without which the cure would certainly not have been effected  need we say that captain wopper stuck to mrs roby and the new cabin to the last  many and powerful efforts were made to induce him to bring his mother to dwell in kensington but mrs roby flatly refused to move again under any suasion less powerful than that of a fire  the eldest of lewis stoutleys boys therefore hit on a plan for frequent and easy intercommunication  he one day suggested the idea of a boatingclub to his brothers and companions  the proposal was received with wild enthusiasm  the club was established and a boathouse with all its nautical appurtenances was built under the very shadow of mrs robys dwelling  a trusty diamond from grubbs court was made boatcleaner and repairer and guardian of the keys and captain wopper was created superintendent general director chairman honorary member and perpetual grand master of the club in which varied offices he continued to give unlimited satisfaction to the end of his days  as for slingsby he became an aspirant to the honours of the royal academy and even dreamt of the presidents chair  not being a madman he recovered from the disease of blighted hopes and discovered that there were other beings as well as nita worth living for  he also became an intimate and welcome visitor at the two kensington mansions the walls of which were largely decorated with his productions  whether he succeeded in life to the full extent of his hopes we cannot say but we have good reason to believe that he did not entirely fail  from time to time lewis heard of his old guide antoine grennon from friends who at various periods paid a visit to the glaciers of switzerland and more than once in after years he and his family were led by that prince of guides over the old romantic and familiar ground where things were not so much given to change as in other regions where the icerivers flowed with the same aspects the same frozen currents eddies and cataracts as in days gone by where the elderly guides were replaced by youthful guides of the same type and metalready to breast the mountain slopes and scale the highest peaks at a moments notice and where antoines cottage stood unchanged with a pretty and rather stout young woman usually kneeling in a tub engaged in the destruction of linen and a pretty little girl who called her mother busy with a miniature washing of her own  the only difference being that the child called antoine grandfather and appeared to regard a strapping youth who dwelt there as her sire and a remarkably stout but handsome middleaged woman as her grandmother  last but not least the professor claims a parting word  little however is known as to the future career of the genial man of science one of whose chief characteristics was his reverent recognition of god in conversing about his works  after returning to his home in the cold north he corresponded for some years with dr lawrence and never failed to express his warmest regard for the friends with whom he had the good fortune to meet while in switzerland  he was particularly emphaticwe might almost say enthusiasticin his expressions of regard for captain wopper expressions and sentiments which the bold mariner heartily reciprocated and he often stated to mrs roby over an afternoon cup of tea his conviction that that roosian professor was out o sight one of the best fellows he had ever met with and that the remembrance of him warmed his heart to furriners in general and roosians in particular this remark usually had the effect of inducing mrs roby to ask some question about his the captains intercourse with the professor which question invariably opened the floodgates of the captains memory and drew from him prolonged and innumerable yarns about his visit to the continentyarns which are too long to be set down here for the captain never tired of relating and old mrs roby never wearied of listening to his memorable rambles on the snowcapped mountains and his strange adventures among therivers of ice  the end
